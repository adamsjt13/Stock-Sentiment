The startup hopes the service will help grow its transaction volumes by tapping into the technology company’s user base. “It’s much more convenient to do it this way,” Gregory Talon, consumer product lead at TransferWise said in an interview. “Because you don’t have to type any of your card details it limits the risk of having somebody watching what you are doing.” Six-year-old TransferWise is one of Europe’s most well-funded fintech companies, with backers including British billionaire Sir Richard Branson, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O)  founder Max Levchin.  It is among the growing cohort of startups that use digital technology to make it easier and cheaper for consumers and businesses to send funds abroad. It currently processes more than $1.2 billion monthly in transfers across 750 currency routes. The company says Apple Pay usage on TransferWise in the UK has been encouraging. Over 10 percent of all TransferWise transactions to and from British Pounds carried out on Apple IOS devices are funded via Apple Pay, the company said.  The move comes as payments partnerships increase, as firms including banks, telecommunications providers and large technology companies seek to gain an edge in the highly competitive sector.  The other countries in which the integration is being rolled out are Australia, Switzerland, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy. "
"2017-09-25",-7,"Digitimes, citing unnamed sources, reported that Apple suppliers were shipping just 40 percent of the components originally ordered for the premium phone, which goes on sale in early November. That added to concerns on Wall Street about demand for Apple’s new devices after the launch on Friday of the iPhone 8, a less expensive model than the iPhone X, drew smaller crowds than previous launches. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some investors saw the tepid iPhone 8 debut as a sign that customers were holding out for the iPhone X, which boasts an edge-to-edge display and will sell in the United States for $999. Amid a broad selloff in technology shares on Monday, Apple’s stock was last down 0.7 percent. It earlier fell as much as 1.8 percent, bringing its loss since a record high on Sept. 1 to 9 percent. Many investors define a correction as a 10 percent decline. A stock in correction may be viewed as either a buying opportunity or as likely to fall further. “I’d buy Apple in this pullback,” said Wedbush trader Joel Kulina. “It’s a high-priced product but super high end.” While the number of people queuing up outside Apple stores has dropped over the past several years with many buyers choosing to shop online, the weak turnout for the latest iPhone has partly been due to poor reviews.

"2017-07-19",-24,"Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Wistron Corp, Compal Electronics Inc and Pegatron Corp alleged that Qualcomm violated two sections of the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law. The accusations, made in a filing late Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, are counterclaims to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in May seeking to force the contractors to pay Qualcomm license fees that Apple directed them to stop paying. “Qualcomm has confirmed publicly that this lawsuit against our clients is intended to make a point about Apple and punish our clients for working with Apple,” Theodore J. Boutrous, a lawyer for the four companies, said in a statement. “The companies are bringing their own claims and defenses against Qualcomm.” The allegations are part of broader dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies so-called modem chip technology that lets iPhones connect to cellular data networks, over the nature of Qualcomm’s business model of linking the sale of chips and patent licenses, which has come under scrutiny by regulators in South Korea, the United States and several other countries. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm alleging that the company had withheld nearly $1 billion of patent license rebates it owed Apple in retaliation for Apple’s cooperation with South Korean regulators. Apple told its contract manufacturers to withhold license payments from Qualcomm while the dispute played out, which prompted Qualcomm to sue them in May. “Despite Apple’s claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company’s conference call in April. Much of the language in the contractors’ allegations mirror Apple’s objections to Qualcomm’s business model. A senior Apple official confirmed that the company is helping to fund the contractors’ legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms. Apple has also formally joined the contractor case as a defendant. The lost license revenue from Apple has been a hit to Qualcomm’s sales. Analysts expect $5.2 billion in revenue for the June quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

"2017-11-02",-6,"Apple declined to comment on the suit. The company started using Intel’s broadband modem chips in the iPhone 7. In its complaint, Qualcomm alleged that Apple was required under its contract to ensure that Apple engineers working with Qualcomm did not communicate details about Qualcomm chips to Apple engineers working on competing chips from Intel. Qualcomm alleged that in July, Apple emailed Qualcomm to request “highly confidential” information about how its chips work on an unidentified wireless carrier’s network. Apple copied an Intel engineer in the email for information, Qualcomm alleged.  In another instance, Qualcomm alleged that an Apple engineer working on a competing chip asked an Apple engineer working with Qualcomm to get technical information from Qualcomm. Reuters reported earlier this week that Apple would drop Qualcomm’s chips altogether from its iPhones and iPads beginning next year. "
"2017-07-31",-18,"U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled late on Friday that iPhone 4 and 4S users can pursue nationwide class action claims that Apple intentionally “broke” FaceTime to save money from routing calls through servers owned by Akamai Technologies Inc . Neither Apple nor lawyers for the plaintiffs immediately responded on Monday to requests for comment. Apple began using Akamai’s servers after losing a lawsuit in 2012 in which VirnetX Holding Corp claimed that FaceTime technology infringed its patents. Testimony from a 2016 retrial in that case showed that Apple paid Akamai $50 million in one six-month period. The plaintiffs said Apple eventually created a cheaper alternative for its iOS 7 operating system, and in April 2014 disabled FaceTime on iOS 6 and earlier systems. Koh said the plaintiffs alleged some measurable loss to their phones’ value, and could try to show that Cupertino, California-based Apple’s conduct constituted a trespass and violated state consumer protection laws. The San Jose, California-based judge twice quoted from what the plaintiffs said was an Apple employee’s internal email characterizing iOS 6 users as “basically screwed” because of the disabling of FaceTime. She also rejected Apple’s argument that the plaintiffs suffered no economic loss because FaceTime was a “free” service. “FaceTime is a ‘feature’ of the iPhone and thus a component of the iPhone’s cost,” Koh said in a footnote. “Indeed, Apple advertised FaceTime as ‘one more thing that makes an iPhone an iPhone.'” The plaintiffs are led by Christina Grace of Marin County, California, and Ken Potter of San Diego County, California, who both owned the iPhone 4. Akamai was not named as a defendant. The case is Grace et al v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-00551."

"2017-06-20",-10,"Apple sued San Diego-based Qualcomm in January, saying the chip maker improperly withheld $1 billion in rebates because Apple helped Korean regulators investigate Qualcomm. Apple’s initial lawsuit was a relatively narrow one focused on whether it violated a contract with Qualcomm by helping regulators that were investigating Qualcomm’s business practices. But the new filing expands Apple’s claims and seeks to stop Qualcomm’s longstanding business model using a legal theory based on a ruling last month. The U.S. Supreme Court made it harder for manufacturers and drug companies to control how their products are used or resold, ruling in May against printer company Lexmark International Inc in a patent dispute over another company’s resale of its used ink cartridges. In a Tuesday brief seen by Reuters, Apple took aim at Qualcomm’s practice of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before purchasing chips, known in the industry as “no license, no chips”. Apple argued that the ruling involving Lexmark showed that Qualcomm was entitled to only “one reward” for its intellectual property and products.  Qualcomm should be allowed to charge for either a patent license or a chip, but not both, Apple argued. Apple wants to be able to buy chips without signing the license agreement that forces it to pay a part of the overall iPhone sale price. Apple also asked the court to stop lawsuits that Qualcomm had filed against Foxconn Technology Group and three other contract makers that assemble the iPhone on Apple’s behalf and are the formal buyers of Qualcomm’s chip, as is standard in the electronics industry. Apple argued that the court fight should be between Apple and Qualcomm."

"2017-09-01",-2,"Cue, a senior vice president, had overseen Siri since 2012 when Scott Forestall, Apple’s software chief at the time, was fired by CEO Tim Cook. Cue is primarily known as Apple’s chief content dealmaker, negotiating the company’s pivotal deals with record companies during the iTunes era and more recently its Apple Music streaming deals and its television content efforts. But Cue also runs Apple’s internet-based services such as iCloud. In recent years, though, Apple has embedded its voice assistant more deeply into its iOS and macOS operating systems, letting it control things like adding calendar appointments, and expanded it from phones to laptops. Siri now controls third-party apps to do things like summon a ride or book a table.  Federighi, a senior vice president, oversees those operating systems. The shift in Siri’s leadership comes as Apple faces increased competition to get users speaking to its devices. Though Apple was the first major tech company to release a voice assistant in 2011, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s voice assistant have emerged to jostle for consumers attention. Amazon and Google have both released voice-activated speakers to showcase their assistants. Amazon has even started selling Echo devices, which feature Alexa, in some of its 470 Whole Foods retail stores. This holiday season, Apple’s will jump into the fray and compete against those speakers with its forthcoming HomePod, which will feature Siri. "

"2017-11-02",2,"The stock’s sharp climb has inspired little fear of a reversal and traders in the options market have been busy adding to bullish bets. “The volume is stronger to the upside calls,” said Steve Claussen, vice president of trade strategy at E-Trade Financial in Chicago, referring to recent trading in Apple’s options. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and are usually used to bet on shares rising. Put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future and are bought to profit from declining shares. “A lot of people are perhaps setting themselves up owning these upside calls thinking Apple is going to trade $180 or something,” Claussen said. There are about 1.43 Apple call options open for each open put contract, close to the most since late December, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Apple’s weekly options contracts imply a 4.5 percent swing in the shares, in either direction, by Friday. That is slightly shy of the 4.6 percent average one-day post-earnings move in the shares over the last eight quarters. The technology sector has surged in recent days as quarterly results from Google-parent Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, have sent their shares soaring. For each of these companies, the shares outstripped their respective options-implied moves and made for big gains for bullish options bets. “I think a lot of people wish they had played the other stocks on the bullish side,” said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Why wouldn’t you expect them to do that in Apple.”  Some positive reviews of Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone X may have helped boost investors sentiment ahead of results, Sosnick said. E-Trade’s Claussen, however, noted that some near-term Apple puts were priced relatively higher than calls, suggesting that despite the bulk of trading activity and positioning pointing to bullish expectations, some element of anxiety remains. Apple dipped 0.5 percent to $166.04 on Thursday. "

"2017-06-29",-1,"After sluggish initial sales, Apple slashed the price to spur holiday sales that year.  “The business model for year one of the iPhone was a disaster,” Tony Fadell, one of the Apple developers of the device, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. “We pivoted and figured it out in year two.”  The very concept of the iPhone came as a surprise to some of Apple’s suppliers a decade ago, even though Apple, led by CEO Steve Jobs, had already expanded beyond computers with the iPod. “We still have the voicemail from Steve Jobs when he called the CEO and founder here,” said David Bairstow at Skyhook, the company that supplied location technology to early iPhones. “He thought he was being pranked by someone in the office and it took him two days to call Steve Jobs back.” The iPhone hit its stride in 2008 when Apple introduced the App Store, which allowed developers to make and distribute their mobile applications with Apple taking a cut of any revenue.  A decade after launching into a market largely occupied by BlackBerry and Microsoft devices, the iPhone now competes chiefly with phones running Google’s Android software, which is distributed to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and other manufacturers around the world. Even though most of the world’s smartphones now run on Android, Apple still garners most of the profit in the industry with its generally higher-priced devices.  More than 2 billion people now have smartphones, according to data from eMarketer, and Fadell, who has worked for both Apple and Alphabet, sees that as the hallmark of success. “Being able to democratize computing and communication across the entire world is absolutely astounding to me,” Fadell said. “It warms my heart because that’s something Steve tried to do with the Apple II and the Mac, which was the computer for the rest of us. It’s finally here, 30 years later.”  "

"2017-07-07",-12,"Imagination ultimately notified shareholders of Apple’s decision on April 3, which sent its shares down 70 percent and eventually forced it to put itself up for sale. Apple’s claims that Imagination sat on the news for weeks without telling shareholders heaps more trouble on the company and could spur regulators to examine whether Imagination improperly withheld information from shareholders, according to one legal expert.  Imagination’s Heath told investors that Apple told Imagination at the end of March that Apple’s new products “at some point in 2018 or early 2019 would not contain our IP and therefore, they were not required to pay us royalties on it.” Apple contested that timeline and said it warned Imagination that it would “stop accepting new IP from them” as early as 2015 and gave a final warning a month before Imagination’s CEO claims. “After lengthy discussions, we advised them on February 9 that we expected to wind down our licensing agreement since we need unique and differentiating IP for our products,” Apple said in the statement.  Imagination did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal UK business hours. Heath has said he does not believe Apple can replace Imagination’s technology without using some of Imagination’s patents that would require royalties. Jonathan Parry, an attorney with UK law firm White & Case who is not involved in the dispute, said European financial regulators were likely to examine the timing of Apple’s discussions with Imagination to see whether Imagination’s leaders failed to disclose material information to shareholders. Regulators would likely focus on when Imagination’s leaders decided it was “likely” that Apple would draw down its business with the company, which Imagination would then be required to disclose to shareholders. The legal bar for “likely” is different from the word’s common usage, he said. “The wording used in judgments is ‘a realistic prospect’ that something might happen,” Parry said. “The judge did not assign a percentage, but he made it clear that something doesn’t have to be ‘more likely than not’” to trigger public disclosure requirements.

"2017-09-20",-5,"The Watch Series 3 starts at $399 and was launched alongside new iPhone models. Unlike previous versions of the watch, it has cellular network connectivity built in. Apple said the watch can experience LTE connectivity problems when it connects to open wi-fi networks such as at a hotel or a coffee shop. The company is “investigating a fix for a future software release,” Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette told Reuters. Many reviewers such as the New York Times praised the new features and gave generally positive assessments. But other prominent publications, including the Wall Street Journal and The Verge, recommended against purchasing the new model because the LTE cellular data connectivity did not work as expected.  ""Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn't function like it was supposed to, I can't recommend buying it — and paying the monthly cell fee — based on promises,"" Verge reviewer Lauren Goode wrote. (bit.ly/2fj8Jiy) Apart from connection issues, some reviewers were disappointed with the drain on the watch’s battery while making calls. Apple had touted up to 18 hours of battery life but said the watch would get only one hour on a cellular phone call.  Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst with Loup Ventures, doubted issues with the Series 3 Watch would hurt Apple’s bottom line. “That review takeaway is a negative but is not a surprise. This is the first generation watch with LTE,” he told Reuters. Bob O‘Donnell, an analyst with Techanlysis Research, said the watch reviews, paired with reviews of the iPhone 8 that were generally positive but described the phone as an incremental improvement on its predecessor, put more pressure on the iPhone X to garner good press before its Nov. 3 launch.

If Apple hadn’t interfered with the licenses and instructed the contract manufacturers to take these actions the contract manufacturers would not be contesting the licenses now,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company’s conference call on Wednesday. Much of the language in the contractors’ allegations mirror Apple’s objections to Qualcomm’s business model. A senior Apple official confirmed the company was helping fund the contractors’ legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms. Apple has also formally joined the contractor case as a defendant. The lost license revenue from Apple has been a hit to Qualcomm’s sales. Analysts expect $5.2 billion in revenue for the June quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier. "

Their work rarely appears outside the journal, which so far has not published any research on self-driving cars. Self-driving cars often use a combination of normal two-dimensional cameras and depth-sensing “LiDAR” units to recognize the world around them.

But with new software, the Apple researchers said they were able to get “highly encouraging results” in spotting pedestrians and cyclists with just LiDAR data. They also wrote they were able to beat other approaches for detecting three-dimensional objects that use only LiDAR. The experiments were computer simulations and did not involve road tests.

"2017-05-17",-15,"The other manufacturers listed in the filing by Qualcomm were Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc. Qualcomm said in its complaint that Apple had advised the contract manufacturers to withhold royalty payments and agreed to indemnify them against any damages resulting from the breach of their agreements with Qualcomm. In the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Qualcomm did not disclose the quantum of royalty owed to it by the manufacturers. San Diego-based Qualcomm said last month that Apple had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers that are owed to the chipmaker, for sales made in the first quarter of 2017, until the dispute is resolved in court. “While not disputing their contractual obligations to pay for the use of Qualcomm’s inventions, the manufacturers say they must follow Apple’s instructions not to pay,” Qualcomm said on Wednesday. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, added in the filing that Apple is trying to force the company to agree to a “unreasonable demand for a below-market direct license”. Apple reiterated that it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but the company has refused to negotiate fair terms. Qualcomm said it sought an order that would require the manufacturers to comply with their long-standing contractual obligations to the company, as well as declaratory relief and damages. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The chipmaker slashed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts last month, saying it excluded revenue receivable from the four contract manufacturers. Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. Foxconn Technology Group is the trading name of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, the main assembler of Apple devices. Qualcomm’s shares were marginally lower at $55.82 in midday trading, while Apple’s shares fell 2.3 percent to $151.85."

"2017-09-01",-2,"Cue, a senior vice president, had overseen Siri since 2012 when Scott Forestall, Apple’s software chief at the time, was fired by CEO Tim Cook. Cue is primarily known as Apple’s chief content dealmaker, negotiating the company’s pivotal deals with record companies during the iTunes era and more recently its Apple Music streaming deals and its television content efforts. But Cue also runs Apple’s internet-based services such as iCloud. In recent years, though, Apple has embedded its voice assistant more deeply into its iOS and macOS operating systems, letting it control things like adding calendar appointments, and expanded it from phones to laptops. Siri now controls third-party apps to do things like summon a ride or book a table.  Federighi, a senior vice president, oversees those operating systems. The shift in Siri’s leadership comes as Apple faces increased competition to get users speaking to its devices. Though Apple was the first major tech company to release a voice assistant in 2011, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s voice assistant have emerged to jostle for consumers attention. Amazon and Google have both released voice-activated speakers to showcase their assistants. Amazon has even started selling Echo devices, which feature Alexa, in some of its 470 Whole Foods retail stores. This holiday season, Apple’s will jump into the fray and compete against those speakers with its forthcoming HomePod, which will feature Siri. "

The data center forms part of Apple’s planned $1 billion investment in the province. China is a key market for Apple, though the U.S. tech group has come under pressure from Chinese regulators in recent months to comply with strict local data laws and assist in curtailing access to overseas content. In late July, Apple said it was removing virtual private network (VPN) services from its app store in China, a move that drew criticism from VPN service providers, who accuse the U.S. company of bowing to pressure from Chinese cyber regulators.

"2017-06-05",1,"Analysts and investors are watching the conference this year for signs of what the company’s next blockbuster product might be a decade after the introduction of its iPhone. The company was expected to introduce iOS 11, the next version of the software that powers the iPhone and iPad. Developers will keep an eye out for hints about new capabilities in the next iPhone, such as so-called augmented reality, in which digital information is overlaid on real-world images. Apple was also expected to unveil improvements to Siri, its digital voice assistant that competes with Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa and the Google Assistant helper. The Siri face for the Apple Watch was the first step in that direction, blending users’ calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked. While Siri was previously available on the Apple Watch, the assistant’s ability to automatically show information was limited. The company is also reportedly working on a home speaker powered by Siri that could be unveiled during the conference, which would be a rarity for an event that traditionally features software and minor updates to hardware such as its Mac laptops. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook also announced on Monday that content from Amazon Prime Video, long absent from the Apple TV product, would come to Apple devices such as the TV, iPhones and iPad later this year.

"2017-07-07",-12,"Imagination ultimately notified shareholders of Apple’s decision on April 3, which sent its shares down 70 percent and eventually forced it to put itself up for sale. Apple’s claims that Imagination sat on the news for weeks without telling shareholders heaps more trouble on the company and could spur regulators to examine whether Imagination improperly withheld information from shareholders, according to one legal expert.  Imagination’s Heath told investors that Apple told Imagination at the end of March that Apple’s new products “at some point in 2018 or early 2019 would not contain our IP and therefore, they were not required to pay us royalties on it.” Apple contested that timeline and said it warned Imagination that it would “stop accepting new IP from them” as early as 2015 and gave a final warning a month before Imagination’s CEO claims. “After lengthy discussions, we advised them on February 9 that we expected to wind down our licensing agreement since we need unique and differentiating IP for our products,” Apple said in the statement.  Imagination did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal UK business hours. Heath has said he does not believe Apple can replace Imagination’s technology without using some of Imagination’s patents that would require royalties. Jonathan Parry, an attorney with UK law firm White & Case who is not involved in the dispute, said European financial regulators were likely to examine the timing of Apple’s discussions with Imagination to see whether Imagination’s leaders failed to disclose material information to shareholders. Regulators would likely focus on when Imagination’s leaders decided it was “likely” that Apple would draw down its business with the company, which Imagination would then be required to disclose to shareholders. The legal bar for “likely” is different from the word’s common usage, he said. “The wording used in judgments is ‘a realistic prospect’ that something might happen,” Parry said. “The judge did not assign a percentage, but he made it clear that something doesn’t have to be ‘more likely than not’” to trigger public disclosure requirements. (Adds missing word “to” in paragraph 4) "
"2017-10-25",1,"Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.  Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.  Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.  Apple’s interest in PowerbyProxi may be driven by the latter’s other products, some of which can support transferring up to 150 watts through any non-metallic material, for wirelessly charging industrial machinery and medical equipment, said Jake Saunders, Asia Pacific vice president of ABI Research. This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.  For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.  Apple recently announced its own AirPower accessory which it said would simultaneously charge up to three devices, including new versions of the Apple Watch, iPhone and AirPod charging case.  PowerbyProxi was founded in 2007 as a spin-out of the University of Auckland. Samsung Ventures, global investment arm of Samsung Group, invested $4 million in the company in 2013.  PowerbyProxi will continue its “growth in Auckland and contribute to the great innovation in wireless charging coming out of New Zealand”, its founder and CEO, Fady Mishriki, said in a statement.

"2017-09-25",-8,"That added to concerns on Wall Street about demand for Apple’s new devices after the launch on Friday of the iPhone 8, a less expensive model than the iPhone X, drew smaller crowds than previous launches. Apple declined to comment. Some investors saw the tepid iPhone 8 debut as a sign that customers were holding out for the iPhone X, which boasts an edge-to-edge display and will sell in the United States for $999.  Amid a broad selloff in technology shares on Monday, Apple’s stock finished down 0.9 percent. It earlier fell as much as 1.8 percent, bringing its loss since a record high on Sept. 1 to 9 percent. Many investors define a correction as a 10 percent decline. A stock in correction may be viewed as either a buying opportunity or as likely to fall further. “I’d buy Apple in this pullback,” said Wedbush trader Joel Kulina. “It’s a high-priced product but super high-end.” While the number of people lining up outside Apple stores has dropped over the past several years with many buyers choosing to shop online, the weak turnout for the latest iPhone has partly been due to poor reviews. Apple’s stock recently traded at 13.8 times expected earnings, its lowest valuation since February, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Over the past two years, Apple’s average forward price-to-earnings ratio has been 12.6.  "

The law firm invited developers to join the complaint in April and on Tuesday filed it to China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees antitrust matters in the country. An Apple spokeswoman told Reuters that guidelines for publishing apps on the App Store were consistent across all countries, and that it was in the process of expanding its local developer relations team. The law firm did not provide details of the developers involved in the complaint.

"2017-10-10",1,"“We love being at the forefront of Apple’s investment in scripted programming,” NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke said in a statement about the show’s planned revival. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Amblin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The deal is the first to be made public since Apple hired veteran Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June to expand the iPhone maker’s push into original programming, a field crowded with streaming services and traditional networks.  It is unclear how people will be able to watch “Amazing Stories” or when it will debut. Apple has not divulged if it will put its own TV series in the iTunes Store, where it sells shows made by other companies, or on another platform. The deal with Spielberg fits with a strategy Apple executives have outlined in meetings with Hollywood executives. Apple has emphasized in the discussions that it wants prestigious programming and to work with A-list actors, producers and writers, according to sources with knowledge of Apple’s plans.  The company already has placed bids on other projects, including for a comedy series about morning television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, sources said.  “They are looking for really high-end premium stuff they feel is creatively in line with the Apple brand,” one source said of Apple’s strategy.     The technology company is competing with several established players that have hooked big name stars, such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO, plus newer entrants like Facebook Inc FB.N. Apple has committed $1 billion to start its programming push, the sources said. Netflix, by comparison, says it will spend up to $7 billion on content next year. The budget for “Amazing Stories” will be more than $5 million per episode, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that Apple had reached a deal for the series. "
"2017-08-01",-3,"This weekend it moved to block apps used to evade the country’s internet censors, a decision that fits with Beijing’s recent crackdown on unapproved online content. And Apple has announced it will establish its first China data center in the politically important province of Guizhou, and has created the new position of a managing director for Greater China, reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. Apple’s China revenues have stalled, falling for a fifth straight quarter in January-March, when sales grew in every other region. China recently slipped to Apple’s third-largest market, as consumers have switched to newer domestic offerings. The buzz around new launches has also cooled since the iPhone 6 in 2014. When it unveiled quarterly earnings on Tuesday, revenue from the Greater China region fell 9.5 percent to $8 billion. Its once coveted iPhone has slipped into fifth position behind offerings from local rivals Huawei [HWT.UL], Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi [XTC.UL], analysts said. The iPhone’s share of China’s smartphone shipments fell to 9 percent in January-June, from a peak of 14 percent in 2015, according to consultancy Counterpoint. Having China’s government on-side will certainly help. “Because others have eaten away at Apple’s market share in China, it now has to pay more attention to regulation from government,” said Beijing-based tech analyst Li Chengdong. “China is such a key market for Apple that it has to listen.” In the company’s earnings call, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said most of the problems in the China market were concentrated in Hong Kong.  “If you look underneath the numbers, Mainland China was actually flat year-over-year” similar to the overall market in that country, Cook said. “And so we’re very encouraged by that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. The Mac grew much more than the market.” Apple, like other U.S. tech brands including Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, has looked to woo China’s leaders to give it greater access, especially as it pushes services such as its App Store and Apple Pay. Services were Apple’s rare bright spot in its struggling China business and logged double-digit revenue growth in Greater China in January-March. Cook said they “grew extremely strongly” during the most recent quarter in China. And maintaining momentum is crucial, as device sales may come under pressure again until Apple unveils its new iPhone, widely expected later this year in a milestone launch that will be key to winning back Chinese buyers. Apple has made swift moves to comply, despite concerns by overseas business groups who say the law’s strict data rules and storage requirements are overly vague. The new data center - part of a planned $1 billion investment in Guizhou province - has a potential political upside too. Beijing wants to turn Guizhou into a tech hub, while President Xi Jinping himself has close ties to the region as a delegate for the province at the Communist Party congress. “By setting up a data center and pulling VPNs, (Apple) is sending a friendly signal to the Chinese government,” said Liu Xingliang, head of the DCCI Internet Research Institute. Apple said at the weekend it would remove virtual private network (VPN) services from its China App Store - systems that allow users to bypass China’s so-called “Great Firewall” aimed at restricting access to overseas sites. Some said the recent moves jarred with Apple’s stance in the United States last year, when it opposed an FBI court order to break into an iPhone of a gunman who fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino in December 2015, with Cook saying it would be “bad for America”. Cook directly addressed those assertions on Tuesday. He said the company believes in “engaging with governments even when we disagree.” “Some folks have tried to link [Apple’s removal of VPNs form the Chinese App Store] to the U.S. situation last year. They’re very different,” Cook said. “In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us. It was very clear. In the case of China, the law is very clear there. Like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we have to abide by them in both cases. That doesn’t mean that we don’t state our point of view in the appropriate way, we always do that.” But the U.S. firm’s gamble here is clear: making moves to appease Chinese censors may prompt criticism outside China, but the firm will hope that local consumers are rather less fazed. “It’s normal that Apple wants to get along well with the Chinese government,” said Wang Siyue, 27, a marketing professional in Shanghai, who is a long-term iPhone user. “I will buy the next generation (iPhone) when it comes out. I‘m just used to it,” Wang said, adding she doesn’t use VPN much, and Apple’s move to take down the app wouldn’t impact her decision to buy a new iPhone.

"2017-06-28",-1,"After sluggish initial sales, Apple slashed the price to spur holiday sales that year.  “The business model for year one of the iPhone was a disaster,” Tony Fadell, one of the Apple developers of the device, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. “We pivoted and figured it out in year two.”  The very concept of the iPhone came as a surprise to some of Apple’s suppliers a decade ago, even though Apple, led by CEO Steve Jobs, had already expanded beyond computers with the iPod. “We still have the voicemail from Steve Jobs when he called the CEO and founder here,” said David Bairstow at Skyhook, the company that supplied location technology to early iPhones. “He thought he was being pranked by someone in the office and it took him two days to call Steve Jobs back.” The iPhone hit its stride in 2008 when Apple introduced the App Store, which allowed developers to make and distribute their mobile applications with Apple taking a cut of any revenue.  A decade after launching into a market largely occupied by BlackBerry and Microsoft devices, the iPhone now competes chiefly with phones running Google’s Android software, which is distributed to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and other manufacturers around the world. Even though most of the world’s smartphones now run on Android, Apple still garners most of the profit in the industry with its generally higher-priced devices.  More than 2 billion people now have smartphones, according to data from eMarketer, and Fadell, who has worked for both Apple and Alphabet, sees that as the hallmark of success. “Being able to democratize computing and communication across the entire world is absolutely astounding to me,” Fadell said. “It warms my heart because that’s something Steve tried to do with the Apple II and the Mac, which was the computer for the rest of us. It’s finally here, 30 years later.”  "

"2017-04-28",-10,"Apple said it had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers until the dispute is resolved in court. The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected.

"2017-05-02",2,"The company boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increasing its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion and raising its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Expectations are building ahead of Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet.

"2017-11-02",2,"The stock’s sharp climb has inspired little fear of a reversal and traders in the options market have been busy adding to bullish bets. “The volume is stronger to the upside calls,” said Steve Claussen, vice president of trade strategy at E-Trade Financial in Chicago, referring to recent trading in Apple’s options. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and are usually used to bet on shares rising. Put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future and are bought to profit from declining shares. “A lot of people are perhaps setting themselves up owning these upside calls thinking Apple is going to trade $180 or something,” Claussen said. There are about 1.43 Apple call options open for each open put contract, close to the most since late December, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Apple’s weekly options contracts imply a 4.5 percent swing in the shares, in either direction, by Friday. That is slightly shy of the 4.6 percent average one-day post-earnings move in the shares over the last eight quarters. The technology sector has surged in recent days as quarterly results from Google-parent Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, have sent their shares soaring. For each of these companies, the shares outstripped their respective options-implied moves and made for big gains for bullish options bets. “I think a lot of people wish they had played the other stocks on the bullish side,” said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Why wouldn’t you expect them to do that in Apple.”  Some positive reviews of Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone X may have helped boost investors sentiment ahead of results, Sosnick said. E-Trade’s Claussen, however, noted that some near-term Apple puts were priced relatively higher than calls, suggesting that despite the bulk of trading activity and positioning pointing to bullish expectations, some element of anxiety remains. Apple dipped 0.5 percent to $166.04 on Thursday. "

An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July, Apple said it had set up its first data center in China, in the southern province of Guizhou, in partnership with a local internet services company, to comply with tougher cyber security laws. The data center forms part of Apple’s planned $1 billion investment in the province. China is a key market for Apple, though the U.S. tech group has come under pressure from Chinese regulators in recent months to comply with strict local data laws and assist in curtailing access to overseas content. In late July, Apple said it was removing virtual private network (VPN) services from its app store in China, a move that drew criticism from VPN service providers, who accuse the U.S. company of bowing to pressure from Chinese cyber regulators.

"2017-10-25",1,"Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.  Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.  Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.  Apple’s interest in PowerbyProxi may be driven by the latter’s other products, some of which can support transferring up to 150 watts through any non-metallic material, for wirelessly charging industrial machinery and medical equipment, said Jake Saunders, Asia Pacific vice president of ABI Research. This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.  For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.  Apple recently announced its own AirPower accessory which it said would simultaneously charge up to three devices, including new versions of the Apple Watch, iPhone and AirPod charging case.  PowerbyProxi was founded in 2007 as a spin-out of the University of Auckland. Samsung Ventures, global investment arm of Samsung Group, invested $4 million in the company in 2013.  PowerbyProxi will continue its “growth in Auckland and contribute to the great innovation in wireless charging coming out of New Zealand”, its founder and CEO, Fady Mishriki, said in a statement.

"2017-09-12",8,"Apple shares on average have gained around 33 percent in the year following each of its previous iPhone launch events, dating back to the first one on Jan 9, 2007. It has gained in the following year after seven of the 10 announcements while falling in three. From their current level, Apple shares need to gain roughly 20 percent to sport the world’s first 13-digit market cap. (Some analysts and the Saudi royal family have pegged global oil giant Saudi Aramco’s value at $2 trillion or more, but there will be no public record to confirm that until after its initial public offering next year.) Of the 38 Wall Street analysts covering Apple, two already have price targets for the stock that see it driving above the $1 trillion level. Brian White of Drexel Hamilton, whose $208 price target for the shares is highest on the Street and would equate to a $1.075 trillion market value at the current number of shares outstanding, came away from Tuesday’s event convinced the stock has further to run. “We continue to believe Apple’s stock will not only benefit from the upcoming iPhone cycle but also the company’s capital distribution initiative, attractive valuation and potential new innovations,” White wrote in a note to clients. “As such, we do not believe Apple’s run will end with today’s iPhone event but still has attractive upside potential.” Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty said in a note to clients after Tuesday’s event that the augmented reality (AR) features in Apple’s new phone lineup “has the potential to become the next killer app that accelerates smartphone upgrades and drives increased services monetization and growth.” Her current price target of $182, which is 13 percent above Tuesday’s closing price of $160.86, would equal a market value of about $940 billion, but Huberty has a “bull case” target of $253 on the stock, or just over $1.3 trillion at current shares outstanding. Apple shares are up 52 percent in the last year. Since Apple first announced the iPhone product line in January 2007, its stock has gained more than 1,200 percent and delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends, of more than 1,375 percent. Its annualized total return of 28.7 percent in that period is nearly three times that of the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC and almost four times what the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX has delivered. And while at nearly $1,150, the new 256 gigabit iPhone X may seem like an eye-popping price, it is no more expensive - relative to Apple’s stock price - than the first iPhone in 2007. The top-end version of the first generation iPhone, at $599, was worth a bit more than seven Apple shares at the time, around the same as today in nominal terms. Apple split its stock on a 7-to-1 basis three years ago. Adjusting for that, one share of pre-split Apple stock would be worth one nearly full iPhone X today. "
"2017-05-02",2,"Chief Executive Tim Cook is focused on milking these users in many ways. It’s selling them more apps, storage, support and music. This recurring source of revenue is expanding quickly, at an 18 percent pace in the latest quarter, and now accounts for 13 percent of total sales. The larger, albeit intermittent, opportunity is persuading customers to add watches and wireless earpods to go along with their iPhones. There’s also a steady need to replace cracked, waterlogged or ageing ones.  The biggest opportunity to extract cash from its devotees – and perhaps even to win over Android fans – is coming. Apple historically rolls out new iPhones in the autumn, and hints from the supply chain indicate it will be a big upgrade this time. That probably will help handset sales toward the end of the year, but also could mean lower revenue in the coming quarter as customers wait for the next iPhone iteration.  Apple shares have gained 27 percent since the start of the year, quadrupling the increase in the S&P 500 Index. Even after a dip in after-hours trading on Tuesday, the company still trades at about 16 times estimated 2017 earnings, a 15 percent discount to the broader market. That seems excessive, given the power of the smartphone duopoly. What’s more, Apple is throwing off enough cash to fund nearly $90 billion of additional capital returns by the end of March 2019 with plenty stored up to keep investing in new products. There should be more than enough there to keep investors humming along as they wait for what’s next.  "
"2017-11-03",-3,"The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast a strong holiday quarter ahead, which will include the iPhone X that started selling on Nov. 3. “We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China, driving more than 20 percent iPhone unit growth and a revenue and earnings beat in 2018,” analyst Katy Huberty on Morgan Stanley said. The glass-and-steel $999 phone appeared to have brought back the frenzy associated with iPhone launches - long lines formed outside Apple stores across the world as fans flocked to buy the new phone. The company will make 30 million iPhone X units during the current quarter, Nomura Instinet analysts estimated, allaying production worries related to the phone. IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones. “We – and many others – had feared that guidance could be weaker, reflecting only 9 weeks of the flagship iPhone X and limitations on supply,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said. At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Citigroup making the most bullish move by raising its price target by $30 to $200. Of the 37 analysts that track the stock, as per Thomson Reuters data, 31 had a “buy”, or higher rating. None had a “sell”. With the latest brokerage actions, at least nine Wall Street analysts now have target prices that put Apple’s market value above $1 trillion. Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White is still the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, raising his target price further to $235. Apple’s fourth-quarter results underscored the company’s ability to drive growth not just on iPhones, but across its range of products, analysts said. The company’s suite now includes five different iPhone models, the iPad, the Mac and the Apple Watch as well as its fast-growing services. Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts’ estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Mac and iPad sales too were above the estimates of most analysts. "

"2017-04-28",-9,"The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple‘s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said.

Weak sales of Apple’s older, cheaper models, as well as premium customers waiting longer to upgrade to the next phone, have weighed on China revenue for the past few quarters. So Apple wants to bring in more money from apps and services. The company said in July it was opening up its first local data centre with a partner to power its iCloud service. App store sales in China, though still small, are up 90 percent year on year in 2016, making the country the fastest-growing and highest-paying app market for the company. Beijing is paying attention. Censors forced Apple to shut down its online book and film stores just six months after launching, the New York Times reported last year, citing sources. Tough cyber-security laws on data surveillance and storage requirements add uncertainty to iCloud. Meanwhile, Apple will have to catch up to Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, which already dominate in cloud storage, mobile payments, app stores and online content.

"2017-09-22",-3,"In Australia, hundreds of people usually gather at Apple’s Sydney city store, with queues winding down George Street in the central business district. But there were fewer than 30 people lining up before the store opened on Friday, according to a Reuters witness. Apple’s flagship store in London’s Regent Street also experienced a slim turnout, according to several British newspapers. Shares of the company were down 1.3 percent to $151.39 in afternoon trading. The stock has lost 6.3 percent since closing at $161.50 on Sept. 11, a day before its new products were announced. While the number of people queuing up outside Apple stores has dropped over the past several years with many buyers choosing to shop online, the weak turnout for the latest iPhone has partly been due to poor reviews.   Mazen Kourouche, who was first in line in Sydney after lining up 11 days outside the store so he could buy and review the product on YouTube, said there were modest refinements. “(It) is pretty similar to the iPhone 7 but it shoots 4k 60 frames per second and it’s got a new glass back instead of the metal which is apparently more durable,” he told Reuters. “There aren’t too many new features to this one.” In China, a loyal Apple customer said the improved camera was one of the reasons she had bought the new device. “I waited until midnight to watch the launch event with my boyfriend to learn what’s new with this iPhone. Its photograph function is pretty good. So I think I must change with no hesitation,” said Ta Na, a 29-year-old consumer in Shanghai. In San Francisco, customers waiting in line were evenly split between those interested in the iPhone 8 and those looking to buy the Apple Watch Series 3. The latest watch includes standalone cellular data connectivity for the first time, meaning it can be used to make phone calls without an iPhone nearby.  Chayce O‘Neal, 27, said he had come to buy the new watch and wasn’t discouraged by reviews that mentioned connectivity problems. But he was skipping the iPhone 8 and holding out for the iPhone X.  “I like being on top of the cutting edge of technology,” he said.  The iPhone 8 will only cater to those who want a new version but do not want to pay a hefty $999 for the iPhone X, said iTWire.com’s technology editor Alex Zaharov-Reutt, who did not line up for the launch. That was the case for Damien Roberts, a customer in line at Apple’s San Francisco store. Roberts owns a battered iPhone 6s and wanted an upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus for phone calls, messages and playing his favorite video game “Clash of Clans.” He said he didn’t need the extra features of the $999 iPhone X. “It’s a lot of money to shell out for a phone,” said Roberts, a Briton who was purchasing the phone while on vacation. Speaking to CNBC, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the Apple Watch with cellular data service is “sold out in so many places around the world” and iPhone 8 models were also sold out. He did not specify the locations he was referring to. The iPhone X is a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Cook has called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone”. “I think it’ll be more lively with more people with the iPhone X,” said Ray Yokoyama, after buying an iPhone 8 in Tokyo.

"2017-05-04",-3,"Graphic: Apple earnings: tmsnrt.rs/1WQvKWe Boss Tim Cook blames a mixture of factors, including a 5 percent currency devaluation, a tourism slump in Hong Kong, and weak sales of older iPhone models. The $772 billion colossus was counting on these slightly lower-end handsets to broaden its base of customers in up-and-coming bits of China, which is already the world’s biggest smartphone market. Instead, Apple shipments tumbled by almost a quarter last year as home-grown rivals such as Huawei and OPPO offered cheaper alternatives, IDC data shows. As a result, Apple’s market share in China has fallen to less than 10 percent of handsets by volume in 2016, down from 13.6 percent the previous year - although it probably accounts for a much larger slice of the profit pool.  Apple remains optimistic. It points to double-digit percentage growth in sales of services, such as app store purchases. Apple gave no further detail, but analysts at App Annie reckon Chinese iPhone users in total now spend more on games, programs and subscriptions than those in any other market. Problem is, iPhones still make up some 90 percent of revenue in China, according to analysts at Cowen and Co. Given the difficulties Apple faces expanding in the mid-market, wowing new users with its next flagship phone will be critical."

"2017-05-17",2,"By Laura Benitez LONDON, May 17 (IFR) - Apple is the latest borrower to take advantage of strong market conditions in Europe, lining up a euro-denominated dual-tranche benchmark on Wednesday. “The market is in super-good shape following the French election, demand for recent deals has been so strong and it still feels like investors want more paper,” said a lead. Corporates have raised €23.2bn in the single currency since centrist Macron was elected president in early May, removing the political risk that had been hanging over the market. The iPhone maker is marketing a dual-tranche senior trade split between an eight-year at mid-swaps plus 45/50bp and a 12-year at swaps plus 60/65bp. Supply has been further helped by the ECB’s corporate purchase programme, which started last June and has removed almost €85bn of paper from the market. “Apple is a very large borrower and has big ambitions regarding shareholder returns, which is what the bonds are typically used for,” the banker said. “It still has a lot of appeal due to it still being a relatively rare name.” However, another banker warned that the glut of supply seen in the corporate market this week could start to hinder the performance of new issues. “The market is a little heavier and slower, supply is not trading up in secondary markets, and we will start to see an impact. Let’s see how today’s deals go,” he said. “If we have to adjust price expectations for these companies then that’s what we have to do.” Apple was last in the European market in September 2015 when it sold a €2bn dual-tranche deal. Apple is one of six companies tapping the European market on Wednesday, adding to a host of jumbo multi-tranche deals from blue-chip names that have already printed this week.

"2017-04-06",-9,"The U.S. technology giant “bricked” - or disabled with a software update - hundreds of smartphones and tablet devices, and then refused to unlock them on the grounds that customers had had the devices serviced by non-Apple repairers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a court filing. “Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. The regulator said that between September 2014 and February 2016, Apple customers who downloaded software updates then connected their devices to their computers received a message saying the device “could not be restored and the device had stopped functioning”. Customers then asked Apple to fix their devices, only to be told by the company that “no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, provide a remedy” for free, the documents added. Apple engaged in “misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations to consumers” about its software updates and customers’ rights to have their products repaired by the company, the commission said. As well as fines, the ACCC said it was seeking injunctions, declarations, compliance programme orders, corrective notices, and costs.

"2017-09-08",-21,"Because those chips have become a standard across the mobile phone industry, Qualcomm is required to license them on fair terms. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for the technology and is engaging in anticompetitive practices. Qualcomm, for its part, has said that it provided fair terms for the parts of technology where it is obligated to do so and that it is within its rights to determine pricing on patents that are not bound by the standards rules. Qualcomm had sought what is known as an “anti-suit” injunction against Apple, seeking to temporarily halt 11 separate lawsuits against Qualcomm and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Taiwan over many of the same pricing and practices issues as the U.S. case. But Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled against Qualcomm and said Apple could proceed with those actions while the U.S. case plays out. “Apple’s declarations make evident that it has sought to challenge Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and anticompetitive conduct territory by territory,” Curiel wrote. “While Qualcomm may object to this litigation strategy as duplicative, the Court will not conclude that Apple’s exercise of its rights under foreign laws is vexatious.” Christine Trimble, vice president of public affairs at Qualcomm, said in a statement, “While we are disappointed by today’s rulings, we recognize that the motions involved high procedural hurdles.”  Apple praised the ruling.       “We are pleased the federal court in San Diego decided Qualcomm must establish the fair value of its technology and defend its business practices in court before forcing Apple and others to pay exorbitant and unfair rates, which amount to a tax on our own inventions,” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement. Qualcomm has also brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action. Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Meantime, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple joined that lawsuit. "

Emonster said it is seeking unspecified money damages and a court order blocking Apple from using the term while the lawsuit is pending.

"2017-11-02",8,"And all Cook had to do was stop Apple’s unusual Steve Jobs-era policy of ruthlessly killing off old products when better ones came along. To see the effect of the Cook Doctrine, look no further than Apple’s current, unprecedented line-up of five different iPhones. The flagship iPhone X, priced at $999, has drawn most of the media attention for the holiday shopping season.   But far from the limelight is the humble iPhone SE - essentially an updated iPhone 5, which came out five years ago. It retails for only $349 and appears to have played a major role in Apple doubling its revenue in India, an important emerging market. Cook told investors on a conference call discussing Thursday’s financial results that “a majority” of the iPhone SEs the company sold in India were also manufactured there, a critical component of Apple’s negotiations with the Indian government for market access. There’s good reason to believe former Apple CEO Jobs would never have kept a product like the SE around. Jobs co-founded Apple and oversaw its dramatic rise in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. But he was pushed out of the company in a conflict with then-CEO John Sculley over the company’s direction in 1985. Over the next decade, Apple lost its dominant position in the personal computer market as devices powered by Microsoft Corp’s Windows gained market share. In an attempt to regain market share, Apple expanded its product line up but found little success. After Apple purchased Jobs’ company and rehired him as CEO in 1997, he famously pared down the company’s product line to just a handful of offerings where he believed Apple could offer the best. And even after the company regained its financial footing in the early 2000s, Jobs had no compunction about killing an old product for something better. The iPod Mini, a svelte version of what was then Apple’s flagship gadget, lasted just a year and a half. Jobs killed that product and replaced it with the iPad Nano, which was even smaller. That approach left Apple with a small product line-up that was profitable but pricey. Analysts nagged the company about when it would offer lower-priced products, and it made a few stabs. The iPad Mini, released in 2013, temporarily boosted iPad sales, but the plastic-backed iPhone 5C was viewed by analysts as a flop. But the Cook Doctrine of letting older models linger and drop in price appears to be working. Apple hit analyst expectations by shipping 46.6 million iPhones in its fiscal fourth quarter, though with lower average selling prices. That doesn’t mean Apple is leaving profit on the table. On the contrary, more phones - whatever the price - help boost the services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store. Services brought in $8.5 billion in revenue in the quarter compared with analyst estimates of $7.5 billion, though that included a favorable $640 million adjustment. More phones also helps boost sales of emerging Apple products such as the Watch, the Airpod wireless headphones and Beats headphones. Executives said sales of those products now rival the size of a “Fortune 400” company, implying they’ll reach sales of about $6.7 billion over the next year. The bet Cook seems to be making is that if Apple lowers the price of entry for getting a taste of its flagship iOS operating system, its customers will want to spend more money in Apple’s ecosystem, even if they do not spring for its most expensive devices. So far, that bet is paying off. Graphic - iPhone comparison: here Graphic - Apple vs the S&P 500 since the first iPhone: here Graphic - Apple earnings: here "
"2017-09-12",-4,"The splashy launch event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s new Apple Park “spaceship” campus - widely considered to be the final product designed by Jobs, who died in 2011. The new products and the holiday shopping season that follows are the most important for Apple in years. The company has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones over the past decade and ushered in the era of mobile computing, but last year suffered a substantial decline in revenue as many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. Apple hopes the new high-end phone, expected to be called the iPhone X, will silence critics who say the company has lost its innovation edge. It features an edge-to-edge display with richer colors and facial recognition to unlock the phone without the need for a fingerprint reader or physical home button. The two other models, expected to be called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, are intended to update the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They could also include some new features, such as a glass back similar to the iPhone 4 that would help facilitate wireless charging. The phones are expected to come with a steep price tag. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicts the top-end model will cost $899, though other analysts expect it to cross the $1,000 threshold. That compares to a top base price of $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus prior. Much of that added costs is driven by more expensive parts, like a higher-resolution display, 3D sensors and more memory capacity. “Some of these components are just darned expensive. There’s just no doubt about that,” said Brian Blau, an Apple analyst at Gartner. Blau expects Apple to keep several lower priced models in its lineup. The company is also expected to reveal more details about the HomePod, its voice-activated home speaker that competes against Amazon.com Inc’s Echo devices and the Google Home speaker. Apple announced the HomePod in June and said it will ship in December. Lastly, Apple is expected to announce a new version of the Apple Watch. Previous versions of the watch had to be tethered to a user’s phone in order to receive send or receive data, but the new version is expected to connect to wireless data networks just like a phone. Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Gene Munster, a veteran Apple watcher and analyst with Loup Ventures, believes the watch could double or even triple in sales because of the new connectivity. But even a huge boom in one product will not move the company’s financials like the iPhone, which accounted for 63 percent of Apple’s $215 billion in sales last year. Even if Apple crushes rivals like Fitbit Inc and Garmin in smart watch sales, Apple remains the iPhone company. “It’s a really big deal for the wearables category for Apple, but it’s not a big deal for the company,” Munster said.

"2017-10-25",-1,"Bloomberg’s report, which cited sources close to people familiar with the situation, said Apple relaxed some of the technical specifications for sensors for the Face ID system, making it faster to test the parts.  A Bloomberg spokeswoman said the company stood behind its report.(bloom.bg/2i3E8CZ) Apple shares were down 0.7 percent at $155.99 in midday trading. The Face ID system - among the $999 iPhone X’s most talked-about features - uses a mathematical model of users’ faces to allow them to sign on to their phones or pay for goods with a steady glance at their phones. Apple has faced a slew of issues with its latest set of phones launched on Sept. 12, with muted demand for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and media and analyst reports suggesting reduced shipment plans for the iPhone X. In its statement, Apple said it expects the iPhone X to go on sale as planned on Nov. 3 with the Face ID feature. “The quality and accuracy of Face ID haven’t changed. It continues to be 1 in a million probability of a random person unlocking your iPhone with Face ID,” the company said in a statement. Bloomberg’s story did not specify whether Apple relaxed its requirements before or after it announced its one-in-a-million accuracy claims for Face ID at a press conference on Sept. 12. "

A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. He also hailed the contributions of French start-ups on Twitter while on his way to a scheduled meeting with Macron on Monday afternoon. The meeting between the French president and Apple CEO follows calls by Macron last week for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe. “Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.26 billion) in back taxes from Apple. Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had quietly worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company. “They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,”  said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.” Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics, one of Europe’s larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so.

"2017-08-29",1,"The first joint team will be located in San Francisco, Gene Reznik, senior managing director of technology and ecosystem at Accenture told Reuters. The companies did not say how many combined Apple-Accenture teams will eventually exist. But the engineering teams will focus on apps that are used by front-line workers and consumers, such as apps that run on iPads for the lobbies of retail banks, where a teller and a customer might both interact with the app. Reznik said another focus will be so-called augmented reality, in which digital objects float over real objects on a screen. That technology could be useful to service technicians in the field, for example by pointing an iPhone or iPad at an engine and highlighting a faulty part that needs repair.  For Apple, the partnership is part of a continued push to win over business clients and try to knock Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) from its long-held throne as the default operating system in the corporate world. To that end, Apple has established partnerships with International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Deloitte and SAP SE (SAPG.DE) aimed at moving more business applications over to iOS devices and making them easier to use in corporate settings. Apple has also moved to make iOS more useful in business situations, specifically on the iPad.

"2017-06-15",-5,"“Anticipation of a new iPhone has been out there for a while now, and maybe we’re entering a period where the stock is topped out,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Apple accounts for about 4.5 percent of his firm’s equity exposure. Apple has surged 48 percent over the past year to record highs, largely in anticipation that the Cupertino, California company will launch an iPhone with major improvements to mark the device’s 10th anniversary.  The company typically unveils its new iPhones in September. Many analysts believe a large number of customers will upgrade to the new device from older phones. A selloff in technology stocks that began last Friday has clipped 4.1 percent off the S&P 500 information technology index as investors worry about stretched valuations in 2017’s top-performing sector.  During that time, Alphabet has lost 5.8 percent, Amazon is down 5.17 percent and Facebook is off 4.03 percent. Apple has declined more than 7 percent in the past five days. Analysts from Pacific Crest and Mizuho Securities downgraded their ratings on Apple this month, both saying the benefits from the expected new iPhone are priced into the stock.   “Without this little flash crash, we were probably going to see some downward movement anyway on Apple,” said Brian Hennessey, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund. “There is some downside risk that was not there to nearly this extent at the beginning of the year. It’s partly timing as you get closer to the launch.”  Apple is the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund’s largest holding. It recently traded at 14.7 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That’s down from an earnings multiple of 16 in midday but above its five-year average of 12.2. But Moskowitz warned that the earnings multiple is near the peak level of early 2015, when strong sales of the iPhone 6 pushed Apple’s stock to record highs, only to slip into a deep downturn. Apple will probably be classified completely as a growth company in an annual rebalancing of Russell indexes on June 23, according to Jefferies.  After that drop in Apple’s stock extended into 2016, Russell allocated 8 percent of Apple as “value” in its investment style indexes, with 92 percent of Apple remaining “growth.”  The expected rebalancing of Apple in Russell’s subindexes reflects its recovery last year and recent record highs.

"2017-10-10",1,"“We love being at the forefront of Apple’s investment in scripted programming,” NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke said in a statement about the show’s planned revival. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Amblin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The deal is the first to be made public since Apple hired veteran Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June to expand the iPhone maker’s push into original programming, a field crowded with streaming services and traditional networks.  It is unclear how people will be able to watch “Amazing Stories” or when it will debut. Apple has not divulged if it will put its own TV series in the iTunes Store, where it sells shows made by other companies, or on another platform. The deal with Spielberg fits with a strategy Apple executives have outlined in meetings with Hollywood executives. Apple has emphasized in the discussions that it wants prestigious programming and to work with A-list actors, producers and writers, according to sources with knowledge of Apple’s plans.  The company already has placed bids on other projects, including for a comedy series about morning television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, sources said.  “They are looking for really high-end premium stuff they feel is creatively in line with the Apple brand,” one source said of Apple’s strategy.     The technology company is competing with several established players that have hooked big name stars, such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO, plus newer entrants like Facebook Inc FB.N. Apple has committed $1 billion to start its programming push, the sources said. Netflix, by comparison, says it will spend up to $7 billion on content next year. The budget for “Amazing Stories” will be more than $5 million per episode, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that Apple had reached a deal for the series. "
"2017-10-31",-5,"The dispute stems from a change in supply arrangements under which Qualcomm has stopped providing some software for Apple to test its chips in its iPhone designs, one of the people told Reuters. The two companies are locked in a multinational legal dispute over the Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple. Qualcomm told Reuters it is providing fully tested chips to Apple for iPhones. “We are committed to supporting Apple’s new devices consistent with our support of all others in the industry,” Qualcomm said in a statement. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Apple’s move is not totally unexpected. Rasgon said it’s too early to say definitively whether Apple fully intends to drop Qualcomm next year because Apple can likely make multiple contingency plans for different supplier scenarios. “Apple is big enough that if they want to support multiple paths, they can do that,” Rasgon said. “Samsung (Electronics Co (005930.KS)) did this too. A couple of years ago, Samsung designed Qualcomm out, but Qualcomm didn’t even know until it was close to time to ship” Samsung’s phones, Rasgon said. (Refiles to add dropped word in paragraph 10.) "

"2017-06-22",2,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc will soon start selling wireless plans from Virgin Mobile USA, the first new carrier offered by the iPhone maker’s since 2013, the companies said on Wednesday. Virgin Mobile USA, a subsidiary of Sprint that licenses its name from the Virgin Group co-founded by Richard Branson, struck the deal as part of a broader revamp of its business that will see it ditch Android phones in the coming years and become what it claims is the first iPhone-only network. Virgin Mobile USA will first be offered in Apple’s stores then online. Apple currently offers AT&T , Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, the last of which was added in 2013.  Branson, wearing an Apple Watch on his left wrist and traditional watch on the other, told Reuters in an interview he sees similarities between the Apple and Virgin brands because both advocate for human rights and other social causes. Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts “has been tremendously supportive of this and loves the proposition,” Branson told Reuters before a launch event in San Francisco. “We were knocking on (an) open door.” Virgin Mobile USA piggybacks on Sprint’s network. Virgin customers pay full price for their phone upfront but are not locked into a contract. Under the deal with Apple, customers who buy a new or refurbished iPhone from Virgin or Apple will get up to one year of service for $1, with service costing $50 per month after that. The refurbished phones will come with an Apple warranty. Because Virgin does not spend money on its own physical stores or big advertising campaigns to acquire customers, the company believes it can make a profit off much less revenue than larger carriers, Virgin Mobile USA CEO Dow Draper said. “The amount of money we have in these customers from an acquisition standpoint is minimal,” Draper said. “Once they make one ($50) payment, we’re back in good shape. Because of the strategy with going through Apple retail and Virgin Mobile’s site, we’ve got a really efficient cost structure.” Virgin Mobile USA also hopes the iPhone push will bring it in line with the rest of Virgin’s brands. Virgin Mobile USA is seen as downmarket because it offers pre-paid phones. Most of Virgin’s other business, such as airlines, hotels and wine clubs, target more upscale consumers. "

"2017-06-09",0,"Apple’s Siri assistant will be integrated into the $349 speaker, and can make music recommendations that pair with the company’s Apple Music service, send text messages, check news and sports scores and control compatible home gadgets like lightbulbs and thermostats. HomePod users may initially be constrained by Siri’s lack of capabilities as compared to Alexa, which also boasts the ability to order millions of Amazon products as well as food from restaurants like Domino‘s.  Apple is expected to announce plans this week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, but initial changes were expected to add just a small number of capabilities. The HomePod speaker stands just under seven inches (18 cm) tall and is covered in fabric mesh that will come in white or gray. A computer processor will tune sound to the room and beam specific parts of music, like a singer’s voice, toward the listener.  Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December.  The speaker, while expected by some industry watchers, marked Apple’s first new product announcement since the Apple Watch in September 2014. As a music-playing device, it will also be a challenger to Sonos, whose wifi-controlled speakers are used by many smartphone users for home entertainment.  A new Siri interface on the Apple Watch will also blend users’ calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked, the company said.  The technology, a feature of the wildly successfully smartphone game Pokemon Go, overlays digital information on real-world images and is seen as an area in which the keenly awaited 10th-anniversary iPhone can stand out from competitors.  New indoor maps of areas like malls and airports indicated that Apple might be laying groundwork to display information over images of those places in the future. The company also rolled out tools for developers to create augmented reality applications for iPhones and iPads. To show the tools off, Apple invited Wingnut AR, the company formed by “Lord of the Rings” director Peter Jackson, on stage.  "
"2017-07-06",-24,"In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm. Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks."

"2017-08-29",0,"Analysts expected the game to make $3 billion for Apple over two years as gamers buy “PokéCoins” from its app store.  Google’s take on the technology will first be available on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google’s own Pixel phone. The company said in a blog post that it hoped to make the system, called ARCore, available to at least 100 million users, but did not set a date for a broad release. Apple in June announced a similar system called ARKit that it plans to release this fall on “hundreds of millions” of devices.  Google and Apple will jockey for the attention of customers and software developers who will build the games, walking guides and other applications that would make AR a compelling feature. Many tech industry leaders envision a future in which eyeglasses, car windshields and other surfaces can overlay digital information on the real world. Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have already experimented with AR glasses. “AR is big and profound,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors earlier in August. “And this is one of those huge things that we’ll look back at and marvel on the start of it.” Apple and Google have had to make compromises to bring the technology to market. In Apple’s case, the Cupertino, California-based company decided to make its AR system work with devices capable of running iOS 11, its next-generation operating system due out this fall. This means it will work on phones going back to the iPhone 6s, which have a single camera at the back and standard motion sensors, rather than a dual camera system found on newer models such as the iPhone 7 Plus or special depth-sensing chips in competing phones. That limits the range of images that can be displayed. Google initially aimed to solve this problem with an AR system called Tango that uses a special depth-sensor, but only two phone makers so far support it. With ARCore, Google changed course to work on phones without depth sensors. But the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem presents challenges. To spread its AR system beyond the Galaxy S8 and Pixel phone, Google will have to figure out how account for the wide variety of Android phone cameras or require phone makers to use specific parts. Apple, however, is able to make its system work well because it knows exactly which hardware and software are on the iPhone and calibrates them tightly. Michael Valdsgaard, a developer with the furniture chain IKEA, called the system “rock solid,” noting that it could estimate the size of virtual furniture placed in a room with 98 percent accuracy, despite lacking special sensors.  “This is a classic example of where Apple’s ownership of the whole widget including both hardware and software is a huge advantage over device vendors dependent on Android and the broader value chain of component vendors,” said Jan Dawson, founder and chief analyst of Jackdaw Research.

"2017-10-20",-2,"An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Apple’s animoji feature allow users to animate the facial expressions of emojis using facial recognition technology. It will be included on the iPhone X which is scheduled for release in November. Phil Schiller, Apple’s chief marketing officer, touted the animoji feature during the iPhone X launch event on Sept. 12, calling it a “great experience” for communicating with family and friends.  Emonster chief executive Enrique Bonansea launched an animated texting app in 2014 called Animoji and registered a trademark on the product name, according to the lawsuit.  Apple had full knowledge of Emonster’s app because it is available for download on Apple’s App Store, the lawsuit said. “Apple decided to take the name and pretend to the world that ‘Animoji’ was original to Apple,” Emonster said in the complaint. Emonster said it is seeking unspecified money damages and a court order blocking Apple from using the term while the lawsuit is pending.  Investors see the iPhone X, which will sell for $999, as an opportunity for Apple to refresh a smartphone lineup that had lagged the competition in new features. The iPhone X has wireless charging, an infrared camera and hardware for facial recognition, which replaces the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. "

For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call. “These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate,” Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview.

"2017-06-20",-17,"By Stephen Nellis June 20 (Reuters) - Apple Inc broadened a legal attack on Qualcomm Inc, arguing to a U.S. federal court that license agreements that secure the chip maker a cut of every iPhone manufactured were invalid. If successful, Apple’s attack would undermine a core tenet of Qualcomm’s business model. “Apple is trying to distract from the fact that it has made misleading statements about the comparative performance of its products, and threatened Qualcomm not to disclose the truth,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. Apple sued San Diego-based Qualcomm in January, saying the chip maker improperly withheld $1 billion in rebates because Apple helped Korean regulators investigate Qualcomm. Apple’s initial lawsuit was a relatively narrow one focused on whether it violated a contract with Qualcomm by helping regulators that were investigating Qualcomm’s business practices. But the new filing expands Apple’s claims and seeks to stop Qualcomm’s longstanding business model using a legal theory based on a ruling last month. The U.S. Supreme Court made it harder for manufacturers and drug companies to control how their products are used or resold, ruling in May against printer company Lexmark International Inc in a patent dispute over another company’s resale of its used ink cartridges. In a Tuesday brief seen by Reuters, Apple took aim at Qualcomm’s practice of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before purchasing chips, known in the industry as “no license, no chips.” The license allows Qualcomm to take a percentage of the overall selling price for the iPhone in exchange for supplying the modem chips that let phones connect to cellular data networks. Apple argued that the ruling involving Lexmark showed that Qualcomm was entitled to only “one reward” for its intellectual property and products. Qualcomm should be allowed to charge for either a patent license or a chip, but not both, Apple argued. Apple wants to be able to buy chips without signing the license agreement that forces it to pay a part of the overall iPhone sale price. “As Apple recently acknowledged, it is rarely first to market with any new technology, which shows it is relying heavily on the R&D investments in the most revolutionary technologies by companies like Qualcomm. We are confident these truths will prevail in our legal disputes with Apple,” Rosenberg said. Apple has also asked the court to stop lawsuits that Qualcomm had filed against Foxconn Technology Group and three other contract makers that assemble the iPhone on Apple’s behalf and are the formal buyers of Qualcomm’s chip, as is standard in the electronics industry. Apple argued that the court fight should be between Apple and Qualcomm. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Leslie Adler)"
"2017-07-20",-11,"They argued that barring Apple from importing foreign-assembled iPhones that use Intel Corp chips - as Qualcomm has requested - would cause “significant shocks to supply” for phones and would hurt consumers. Qualcomm declined to comment. Intel and Apple rival Samsung are members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group.  ”If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices,“ Ed Black, the CEO of the group, said in a statement. “What’s at stake here is certainly the availability of iPhones and other smartphones at better prices.” Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks. The two have been locked in a sprawling legal battle in which Apple has objected to Qualcomm’s business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips. In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm’s profit outlook.  Earlier this month, Qualcomm sued Apple on separate allegations that Apple infringed six patents around making iPhones work better without draining the battery. Simultaneously, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the U.S. ITC seeking to ban iPhones that use chips “other than those supplied by Qualcomm affiliates.” Apple began using Intel chips in the iPhone 7. "
"2017-08-29",1,"The first joint team will be located in San Francisco, Gene Reznik, senior managing director of technology and ecosystem at Accenture told Reuters. The companies did not say how many combined Apple-Accenture teams will eventually exist. But the engineering teams will focus on apps that are used by front-line workers and consumers, such as apps that run on iPads for the lobbies of retail banks, where a teller and a customer might both interact with the app. Reznik said another focus will be so-called augmented reality, in which digital objects float over real objects on a screen. That technology could be useful to service technicians in the field, for example by pointing an iPhone or iPad at an engine and highlighting a faulty part that needs repair.  For Apple, the partnership is part of a continued push to win over business clients and try to knock Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) from its long-held throne as the default operating system in the corporate world. To that end, Apple has established partnerships with International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Deloitte and SAP SE (SAPG.DE) aimed at moving more business applications over to iOS devices and making them easier to use in corporate settings. Apple has also moved to make iOS more useful in business situations, specifically on the iPad. The next version of the operating system, expected this fall, includes a system for dragging and dropping files much like a PC or a Mac computer. “All those features really help it be a better overall productivity machine,” Susan Prescott, vice president of application product marketing at Apple, told Reuters. “It’s becoming more realistic for more workers to use iOS as their primary device.” "

"2017-07-19",-23,"The accusations, made in a filing late on Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, are counterclaims to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in May seeking to force the contractors to pay Qualcomm license fees that Apple directed them to stop paying. “Qualcomm has confirmed publicly that this lawsuit against our clients is intended to make a point about Apple and punish our clients for working with Apple,” Theodore J. Boutrous, a lawyer for the four companies, said in a statement. “The companies are bringing their own claims and defenses against Qualcomm.” The allegations are part of broader dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies so-called modem chip technology that lets iPhones connect to cellular data networks, over the nature of Qualcomm’s business model of linking the sale of chips and patent licenses, which has come under scrutiny by regulators in South Korea, the United States and several other countries. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging the company had withheld nearly $1 billion of patent license rebates it owed Apple in retaliation for Apple’s cooperation with South Korean regulators. Apple told its contract manufacturers to withhold license payments from Qualcomm while the dispute played out, which prompted Qualcomm to sue them in May. ”It is clear that Apple is controlling all of the contract manufacturers’ statements and actions in the litigation. If Apple hadn’t interfered with the licenses and instructed the contract manufacturers to take these actions the contract manufacturers would not be contesting the licenses now,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company’s conference call on Wednesday. Much of the language in the contractors’ allegations mirror Apple’s objections to Qualcomm’s business model. A senior Apple official confirmed the company was helping fund the contractors’ legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms. Apple has also formally joined the contractor case as a defendant. The lost license revenue from Apple has been a hit to Qualcomm’s sales. Analysts expect $5.2 billion in revenue for the June quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier. "

The mean price target of 37 financial analysts covering Apple stands at $176.70, equivalent to a market value of $913 billion.  At least four analysts have target prices for Apple that put its market value above $1 trillion. Drexel Hamilton's White, the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, has a target price of $208, equivalent to a market capitalization of $1.074 trillion. (reut.rs/2z5egB9) No analysts recommend selling Apple shares, but among the seven with “hold” ratings, one of the least enthusiastic is Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang, with a $140 price target.   Initial reviews of the iPhone X called it the best iPhone yet, although some reviewers pointed out potential glitches in FaceID, the company’s new face recognition system. "
"2017-07-18",2,"“Apple is strongly committed to invest and grow in China,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in the statement. “We look forward to making even greater contributions under her leadership.” The announcement comes as Apple works to meet compliance measures under a new law requiring foreign firms to store data locally in partnership with Chinese entities. Apple last week said it will invest in a $1 billion project in Guizhou province which will include a data center run with a local partner. It said none of its systems will have so-called backdoors that allow outside parties to access data. Ge Mahe’s previous projects include working with China’s state-backed telecom firms to develop country-specific functions including the ability to use local telephone numbers as Apple identification numbers, short message service (SMS) fraud detection, and support for quick response (QR) codes which are widely used in China for payments.  “I am looking forward to deepening our team’s connections with customers, government and businesses in China to advance innovation and sustainability,” said Ge Mahe in the statement. In the new role she will report directly to Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jim Williams, the company said. "
"2017-10-12",-5,"Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.  High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.  Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.  A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data center there. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would color decisions that they might make about future investments. The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly. It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs. "
"2017-11-22",-9,"“We discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime,” Apple said in a statement. Apple and Foxconn have been accused of poor labor practices in the past, but the U.S. technology giant has been trying to get a grip of such issues, releasing annual reviews of the iPhone supply chain. The violations announced this week come as the company is stretching to meet demand for its new iPhone X, which began shipping this month. The FT report said the students, aged between 17-19, were being forced by their school to participate in the internship.  “Our policies do not allow interns to work more than 40 hours per week on program-related assignments. Unfortunately, there have been a number of cases where portions of our campuses have not adhered to this policy,” Foxconn said in a statement, adding that the interns accounted for a small part of the workforce.   Apple’s statement said that the company had sent staff to the site to address the violations. Labor rights groups have previously criticized Apple and Foxconn for excessive overtime, hiring underage workers and failing to provide health insurance.  Since 2012 Apple says it has reduced the number of underage workers in its extended supply chain, which includes locations where rare earth minerals are mined for use in the smartphones. "
"2017-09-12",8,"Apple shares on average have gained around 33 percent in the year following each of its previous iPhone launch events, dating back to the first one on Jan 9, 2007. It has gained in the following year after seven of the 10 announcements while falling in three. From their current level, Apple shares need to gain roughly 20 percent to sport the world’s first 13-digit market cap. (Some analysts and the Saudi royal family have pegged global oil giant Saudi Aramco’s value at $2 trillion or more, but there will be no public record to confirm that until after its initial public offering next year.) Of the 38 Wall Street analysts covering Apple, two already have price targets for the stock that see it driving above the $1 trillion level. Brian White of Drexel Hamilton, whose $208 price target for the shares is highest on the Street and would equate to a $1.075 trillion market value at the current number of shares outstanding, came away from Tuesday’s event convinced the stock has further to run. “We continue to believe Apple’s stock will not only benefit from the upcoming iPhone cycle but also the company’s capital distribution initiative, attractive valuation and potential new innovations,” White wrote in a note to clients. “As such, we do not believe Apple’s run will end with today’s iPhone event but still has attractive upside potential.” Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty said in a note to clients after Tuesday’s event that the augmented reality (AR) features in Apple’s new phone lineup “has the potential to become the next killer app that accelerates smartphone upgrades and drives increased services monetization and growth.” Her current price target of $182, which is 13 percent above Tuesday’s closing price of $160.86, would equal a market value of about $940 billion, but Huberty has a “bull case” target of $253 on the stock, or just over $1.3 trillion at current shares outstanding. Apple shares are up 52 percent in the last year. Since Apple first announced the iPhone product line in January 2007, its stock has gained more than 1,200 percent and delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends, of more than 1,375 percent. Its annualized total return of 28.7 percent in that period is nearly three times that of the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC and almost four times what the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX has delivered. And while at nearly $1,150, the new 256 gigabit iPhone X may seem like an eye-popping price, it is no more expensive - relative to Apple’s stock price - than the first iPhone in 2007. The top-end version of the first generation iPhone, at $599, was worth a bit more than seven Apple shares at the time, around the same as today in nominal terms. Apple split its stock on a 7-to-1 basis three years ago. Adjusting for that, one share of pre-split Apple stock would be worth one nearly full iPhone X today. "

"2017-10-30",3,"But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday. Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results. Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock  had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.  The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day. Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year. In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”. “With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said. Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand. Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.” However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.  “Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said. “A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.” Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker. "

"2017-09-12",-2,"The Series 3 of the Apple Watch, released on Tuesday along with the much-anticipated iPhone X, features wireless LTE connectivity. That means customers will be able to make phone calls or send text messages from the watch without needing to have an iPhone nearby, as they do with earlier models. The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in “Dick Tracy,” the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys. “This has been our vision from the beginning,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event. “Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected. It’s really nice to know you can be reached if needed.” To be sure, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014, but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power. They also require a separate phone number. Apple claims its new Series 3, on the other hand, will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2. And it will have the same phone number as a customer’s iPhone, which is still required. Apple said that all four major U.S. carriers will offer service for the watch, and AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra $10 a month. Analysts generally believe the new connectivity could ignite sales, though there is little consensus as to how much. At $399, the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model, the $329 Series 2, which introduced standalone GPS capability. That $70 extra buys much more useful capabilities - including the ability to stream music from Apple Music. “The third time is the charm for the watch,” said Bob O‘Donnell of Techanalysis Research. What may hold some consumers back is the monthly recurring charge, which would far exceed the extra cost of the Series 3 over older watches over time, said Brian Blau, an Apple analyst with Gartner. “Yes, you do have to pay for that extra data plan, but it sounds like the carriers are at least going to make it relatively easy to do,” Blau said. Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018. Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump, to 26 million units in 2018. Either way, Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals like Fitbit Inc and Garmin Ltd, which would be hard-pressed from a technical and business standpoint to match Apple’s wireless features. Garmin and Fitbit did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside normal business hours. The Watch will remain a blip in Apple’s sales, which were $215 billion last year. But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without - all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses. "
"2017-07-06",-22,"Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7.  Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.  Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. "

"2017-09-08",-21,"Because those chips have become a standard across the mobile phone industry, Qualcomm is required to license them on fair terms. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for the technology and is engaging in anticompetitive practices. Qualcomm, for its part, has said that it provided fair terms for the parts of technology where it is obligated to do so and that it is within its rights to determine pricing on patents that are not bound by the standards rules. Qualcomm had sought what is known as an “anti-suit” injunction against Apple, seeking to temporarily halt 11 separate lawsuits against Qualcomm and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Taiwan over many of the same pricing and practices issues as the U.S. case. But Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled against Qualcomm and said Apple could proceed with those actions while the U.S. case plays out. “Apple’s declarations make evident that it has sought to challenge Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and anticompetitive conduct territory by territory,” Curiel wrote. “While Qualcomm may object to this litigation strategy as duplicative, the Court will not conclude that Apple’s exercise of its rights under foreign laws is vexatious.” Christine Trimble, vice president of public affairs at Qualcomm, said in a statement, “While we are disappointed by today’s rulings, we recognize that the motions involved high procedural hurdles.”  Apple praised the ruling.       “We are pleased the federal court in San Diego decided Qualcomm must establish the fair value of its technology and defend its business practices in court before forcing Apple and others to pay exorbitant and unfair rates, which amount to a tax on our own inventions,” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement. Qualcomm has also brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action. Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple. In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio.

Apple accounts for about 4.5 percent of his firm’s equity exposure. Apple has surged 48 percent over the past year to record highs, largely in anticipation that the Cupertino, California company will launch an iPhone with major improvements to mark the device’s 10th anniversary.  The company typically unveils its new iPhones in September. Many analysts believe a large number of customers will upgrade to the new device from older phones. A selloff in technology stocks that began last Friday has clipped 4.1 percent off the S&P 500 information technology index as investors worry about stretched valuations in 2017’s top-performing sector.  During that time, Alphabet has lost 5.8 percent, Amazon is down 5.17 percent and Facebook is off 4.03 percent. Apple has declined more than 7 percent in the past five days. Analysts from Pacific Crest and Mizuho Securities downgraded their ratings on Apple this month, both saying the benefits from the expected new iPhone are priced into the stock.   “Without this little flash crash, we were probably going to see some downward movement anyway on Apple,” said Brian Hennessey, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund. “There is some downside risk that was not there to nearly this extent at the beginning of the year. It’s partly timing as you get closer to the launch.”  Apple is the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund’s largest holding. It recently traded at 14.7 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That’s down from an earnings multiple of 16 in midday but above its five-year average of 12.2. But Moskowitz warned that the earnings multiple is near the peak level of early 2015, when strong sales of the iPhone 6 pushed Apple’s stock to record highs, only to slip into a deep downturn. Apple will probably be classified completely as a growth company in an annual rebalancing of Russell indexes on June 23, according to Jefferies.  After that drop in Apple’s stock extended into 2016, Russell allocated 8 percent of Apple as “value” in its investment style indexes, with 92 percent of Apple remaining “growth.”  The expected rebalancing of Apple in Russell’s subindexes reflects its recovery last year and recent record highs.

The iPhone capabilities will come in Cochlear’s newest sound processor that sits outside the ear, the Nucleus 7, expected to be released in September. Users can upgrade the processor without a new implant. Colorado-based Cochlear’s processors gather sound from the environment, turning it into an electrical signal and send it to an electrode implanted in the ears of people with hearing loss. The improvement will help Russ Levanway, the founder of a small IT business called TekTegrity. Levanway lost most of his hearing when was 4 years old because of an illness, but cochlear implants let him hear close to normally in face-to-face conversations. Levanway ran his business for a decade mostly through emails and in-person meetings until Cochlear’s Bluetooth models came out a few years ago. “It works pretty well, but it’s not seamless. I have to join conference calls early and work out the glitches before the call starts,” Levanway said. “To hear Apple is doing something that connects directly with the implant, that’s tremendous.” Apple has also worked with hearing aide firms such as GN ReSound and Starkey, which can also connect directly to the iPhone. Apple developed the protocols with the firms and licenses it to them for free. Sarah Herrlinger, director of global accessibility policy for Apple, said a key challenge with implants was fact that audiologists do not always prescribe a matched set of Cochlear implants. Often doctors recommend one implant and one hearing aide, often from a different maker. “We had to figure out how you could do a bi-modal solution where you’re able to simultaneously pair, control and hear both of them running at the same time,” she said. “That was a really interesting engineering opportunity for us to solve.” "

"2017-10-30",2,"Apple has ceased to give its own numbers on iPhone sales, leaving investors and analysts striving to track output through research with its suppliers, consumer surveys and other industry indicators. But the Cupertino-based firm did say on Friday that pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”. In a note on Monday, research house GBH Insights raised its pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a ‘stellar success’. Shares of the company gained another 0.7 percent in premarket trading after rising 3.6 percent on Friday. “With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, November 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said. Another analyst, Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand. But a third, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November. “Although we believe Apple is benefitting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said. “A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.” (Reporting by Arjun Panchadar and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru)"
"2017-08-01",2,"The U.S. tech giant has been in talks with Indian officials since May of last year, when CEO Tim Cook and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to set up a production base in the country that goes beyond just assembling the devices, as happens today. The two sides have been discussing a list of “prerequisites” that Apple submitted in October, including duty exemption on raw materials for manufacturing components and capital equipment for 15 years for it to make iPhones from scratch in India. The company has told the government it would be bringing in a host of these ancillary units when it sets up operations to cater to India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets, a top government official said. “They want the same treatment to be given to the component manufacturers; the tax concessions, they want everything. But then some kind of policy will have to be evolved,” the official said.  Apple declined to comment. The demand could further delay Apple’s plans to penetrate the Indian market, the world’s third largest for smartphones behind the United States and China, but where it has only a 2 percent share. The company is looking to India after sales in the Greater China region, once a major growth driver, slid 14 percent year-on-year to $10.7 billion in the three months ended April 1. In May, Apple, working with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru. The plan that Modi and Cook ordered the two sides to work on, however, envisages manufacturing a full range of iPhones for the domestic market, as well as for export.  It would also spawn a vast network of suppliers, in the way that India’s auto ancillary sector took off to feed Maruti Suzuki India’s (MRTI.NS) production line over three decades ago. Another official, who has led efforts to secure foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, said Apple’s proposal to build its phones in India was being examined favorably by the government. “My view is that India needs to support Apple to create an ecosystem, which was done for Maruti. This helped to build the automobile and auto component industry in India,” the official said, seeking anonymity in line with government policy. “Initial support will pay rich dividends in the long run and facilitate innovation, design and manufacturing of electronics components in India,” the official added. Apple competitors such as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and China’s Oppo could also benefit from a broader policy review as they, too, currently have predominantly assembly operations in India. Another government official familiar with the matter said it would be difficult for India to agree to Apple’s request for a customs holiday for just its own operations in India. Customs duties have already been slashed in order to make India a hub for handset assembly lines, the official said. That move has encouraged phone makers to set up such facilities in India, and so the duty structure cannot be changed for one company, the official said. "
"2017-11-02",8,"And all Cook had to do was stop Apple’s unusual Steve Jobs-era policy of ruthlessly killing off old products when better ones came along. To see the effect of the Cook Doctrine, look no further than Apple’s current, unprecedented line-up of five different iPhones. The flagship iPhone X, priced at $999, has drawn most of the media attention for the holiday shopping season.   But far from the limelight is the humble iPhone SE - essentially an updated iPhone 5, which came out five years ago. It retails for only $349 and appears to have played a major role in Apple doubling its revenue in India, an important emerging market. Cook told investors on a conference call discussing Thursday’s financial results that “a majority” of the iPhone SEs the company sold in India were also manufactured there, a critical component of Apple’s negotiations with the Indian government for market access. There’s good reason to believe former Apple CEO Jobs would never have kept a product like the SE around. Jobs co-founded Apple and oversaw its dramatic rise in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. But he was pushed out of the company in a conflict with then-CEO John Sculley over the company’s direction in 1985. Over the next decade, Apple lost its dominant position in the personal computer market as devices powered by Microsoft Corp’s Windows gained market share. In an attempt to regain market share, Apple expanded its product line up but found little success. After Apple purchased Jobs’ company and rehired him as CEO in 1997, he famously pared down the company’s product line to just a handful of offerings where he believed Apple could offer the best. And even after the company regained its financial footing in the early 2000s, Jobs had no compunction about killing an old product for something better. The iPod Mini, a svelte version of what was then Apple’s flagship gadget, lasted just a year and a half. Jobs killed that product and replaced it with the iPad Nano, which was even smaller. That approach left Apple with a small product line-up that was profitable but pricey. Analysts nagged the company about when it would offer lower-priced products, and it made a few stabs. The iPad Mini, released in 2013, temporarily boosted iPad sales, but the plastic-backed iPhone 5C was viewed by analysts as a flop. But the Cook Doctrine of letting older models linger and drop in price appears to be working. Apple hit analyst expectations by shipping 46.6 million iPhones in its fiscal fourth quarter, though with lower average selling prices. That doesn’t mean Apple is leaving profit on the table. On the contrary, more phones - whatever the price - help boost the services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store. Services brought in $8.5 billion in revenue in the quarter compared with analyst estimates of $7.5 billion, though that included a favorable $640 million adjustment. More phones also helps boost sales of emerging Apple products such as the Watch, the Airpod wireless headphones and Beats headphones. Executives said sales of those products now rival the size of a “Fortune 400” company, implying they’ll reach sales of about $6.7 billion over the next year. The bet Cook seems to be making is that if Apple lowers the price of entry for getting a taste of its flagship iOS operating system, its customers will want to spend more money in Apple’s ecosystem, even if they do not spring for its most expensive devices. So far, that bet is paying off. Graphic - iPhone comparison: here Graphic - Apple vs the S&P 500 since the first iPhone: here Graphic - Apple earnings: here "

"2017-06-16",2,"“Jamie and Zack are two of the most talented TV executives in the world and have been instrumental in making this the golden age of television,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “There is much more to come,” Cue said of Apple’s video effort. The new hires demonstrate a serious commitment by another deep-pocketed technology company to produce quality television shows. Erlicht and Van Amburg have served as senior Sony television executives since 2005. But Apple did not elaborate on its strategy, leaving investors guessing how many shows it plans to distribute, how much it will spend and where the programming will be available.  The company is playing in an increasingly competitive field. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have invested billions of dollars in award-winning comedies and dramas featuring A-list Hollywood stars. And social media company Facebook Inc (FB.O) has signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators, including Vox and BuzzFeed, to make shows for its upcoming video service. Apple began its move last week with reality program “Planet of the Apps,” an unscripted show about developers competing for venture capital funding. The series is available only to subscribers to Apple Music, a $10-a-month streaming service. As tech companies push further into the content business, pressure mounts on traditional media outlets that do not have the same amount of data on viewers or the ability for content to be a loss leader, said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG.  “These companies do not need to make money off video because they can make money other ways,” Greenfield said. “And they are going to have tons of data on their viewers.” “From a credit perspective, we’d much rather see Apple overpay to deliver original content than pay $50 billion to buy Netflix and basically compete for the same content,” he said. “They’ll definitely get a better bang for their buck by focusing on their Apple TV product.”  Greenfield said news of Apple’s hires should put to rest rumors that Apple might acquire another content company, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). “It’s pretty clear now that Apple isn’t buying Disney,” he said.  Disney shares were down 0.5 percent at $105.40 on Friday afternoon. Apple shares were down 0.9 percent at $143.01. For Sony, the departures come as the Japanese conglomerate revamps its movie and television studio under new Chief Executive Tony Vinciquerra. In a memo to staff, Vinciquerra suggested Apple could be a buyer of Sony programming.  “While we are sad to see them go, we are excited by the opportunity to work with them as partners in the future,” he said.

"2017-05-03",-3,"Cook also said Apple plans to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps, and will release more details about the effort this summer. The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the United States. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China.  In February during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its U.S. suppliers, which include firms like 3M Co (MMM.N) and Corning Inc (GLW.N), the first time Apple has disclosed the metric. Apple is highlighting its U.S. presence at the same time lawmakers consider a major tax proposal by Trump that would let Apple, along with other large companies, bring back accumulated profits from overseas at potentially lower tax rates. Ninety-three percent of Apple’s $256.8 billion cash is held overseas. Cook, who met with lawmakers in Washington earlier this year to discuss tax policy and technology issues, said that Apple would have to borrow the cash for its U.S. manufacturing investment fund and said he was hopeful Trump administration would address the repatriation issue. Cook stopped short of saying Apple would bring some of its cash back into the United States if Trump’s tax proposal was enacted. “To invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis. So I think the administration, you saw they’re really getting this and want to bring this (cash) back. And I hope that comes to pass,” Cook said in response to a question about tax reform. "
"2017-10-10",-14,"The Justice Department will provide the high court with its stance on the matter. The dispute could have a major impact on electronic commerce, which has seen explosive growth, with $390 billion in U.S. retail sales last year alone.  Electronic marketplaces like the App Store, ticket site StubHub, Amazon’s (AMZN.O) Marketplace and eBay (EBAY.O) where individual sellers set prices rather than the marketplace itself potentially could be sued by consumers. The antitrust claims date back to a 2011 lawsuit filed by several iPhone buyers in California federal court, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, according to court papers. They allege that Cupertino, California-based Apple has monopolized the sale of apps like messaging programs and games, leading to inflated prices. The company has sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, saying the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the case because they are not charged the commission. The plaintiffs countered that they, not the developers, pay Apple for apps at prices that include the commission, which they called a “monopolistic surcharge.” The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January sided with the plaintiffs, ruling that because consumers directly bought products from Apple they were entitled to sue.

"2017-09-12",1,"By Stephen Nellis CUPERTINO, Calif., Sept 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a redesigned product of glass and stainless steel with an edge-to-edge display that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” The phone features wireless charging, an infrared camera and special hardware for facial recognition, which will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button found on previous iPhones is also gone, and users will instead tap the device to wake it up. But in an embarrassing moment for Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi, the face ID unlocking did not work on his first attempt during the on-stage presentation. The phone, which is priced at $999 and ships on Nov. 3, as well as the holiday shopping season that will follow are the most important for Apple in years. Shares of Apple were last down 1.3 percent after erasing gains of up to 1 percent during the launch event. The company has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones over the past decade and ushered in the era of mobile computing, but last year had a substantial decline in revenue as many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. The screen on the iPhone X is about the size of the current iPhone 7 plus, though the phone itself is smaller. It features richer colors thanks to a new technology called OLED that other vendors such as Samsung are also rolling out. Apple also introduced the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus, which resemble the iPhone 7 line but have a glass back for wireless charging. The new phones feature Apple’s first proprietary graphics processor, which provides greater speed, improved cameras and some features for augmented reality apps. The cheapest phones have 64 gigabytes of memory, up from 32 gigabytes in previous models, and will sell for $699 and $799. The company also introduced an upgraded Apple Watch, which can make phone calls and access the internet without the user carrying an iPhone. The Series 3 watch will cost $399. Apple did not provide sales figures for its watches, but Cook said sales had risen 50 percent from the year before and that the Apple Watch was now the best-selling watch in the world. Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures, believes sales of the watch could double or even triple because of the new connectivity. The upgraded Apple TV will support the high resolution display known as 4K and will also feature more programming options as Apple steps up its efforts to cut content deals and produce its own shows. The Apple building itself was considered to be Jobs’ final product, and Cook spent a few minutes boasting about the design, energy-saving features and public spaces at the new campus, including a flagship Apple Store. The theater, never before open to the public, features an expansive glass-enclosed lobby, with two massive white stone staircases leading down to the auditorium. Inside, the decor is similar to that of Apple’s stores, with hard maple flooring and tan leather seats. "

Apple has used Imagination’s technology in its products from the time of the iPod, and it receives royalties from every sale of an Apple device containing its designs, including the iPhone and iPad. Imagination said in April that it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating its patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. It said on Thursday it had been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple on an alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. “Imagination has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the license agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process,” it said.

"2017-08-02",-3,"But much of that trade has been wiped out as Apple has opened more mainland stores, recent new phone launches have been simultaneous in China and Hong Kong rather than staggered, and local phone brands have increased their share of the world’s biggest smartphone market. “I want to do something else, make a change,” said the shopkeeper amid dozens of shuttered stores. “Relying on iPhones can barely help you make a living now. You can’t really earn much money.”  He didn’t want to be named as he resells phones to so-called parallel traders - who buy goods in Hong Kong to sell at a profit across the border. After 10 years selling phones, the shopkeeper said parallel traders now account for less than half his business, down from 80-90 percent previously. Traders now sell as much to the Middle East and Russia, he said. His tale reflects a broader trend in Hong Kong; the demise of the city’s role as a middleman selling everything from formula milk and iPhones to mainland Chinese concerned about food safety or eager to quickly get their hands on high-tech gadgets. iPhone shipments in China declined year-on-year for a second straight quarter, according to Canalys, a consultancy, adding shipment volume dropped 12 percent in April-June from last year, and 14 percent from the previous quarter. “People are waiting for the next iPhone. We expect shipments to rebound in Q3 and Q4 ... Revenue from iPad and MacBook sales made up for dropping iPhone sales,” said Canalys analyst Mo Jia. According to Canalys’ tracking of smartphone shipments, Apple’s iPhone shipment volume in Hong Kong represented 4.5 percent of that in mainland China in the latest quarter, down from 33 percent just two years ago. In 2009, when there was just a single Apple store in mainland China, Apple shipped more phones to Hong Kong than to the mainland - though many of those found their way across the border in what was a profitable trade for smugglers, and tourists. “Chinese consumers increasingly favor Chinese brands, and Apple is no longer as fashionable in China as it was,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics analyst.

A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted.  Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe. “Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple. Asked if they had discussed France’s proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: “They didn’t go into specifics.” “The tone was very open. This wasn’t a posturing competition.” Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added.  Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.  “They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,”  said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”  Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

Ahead of the Nov. 3 release of the redesigned glass and stainless steel device, some analysts have questioned its price tag: At $999 for the base model, it is the most expensive iPhone to date. But Cook last week said pre-orders of the iPhone X were “off the charts”, while the company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone. At Wednesday’s $166.89 stock price, down 1.3 percent from a record high, the Cupertino, California company’s market capitalization stood at $862 billion.  Since the first iPhone in January 2007, Apple's stock has surged almost  1,300 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 83-percent increase. Including dividends, Apple's total return has been about 1,400 percent. (tmsnrt.rs/2z5YNB0) Apple’s stock has risen about 26 percent per year on a compound basis since the start of 2007, a trajectory that - based on its current shares outstanding - could see it reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion in mid-2018. The mean price target of 37 financial analysts covering Apple stands at $176.70, equivalent to a market value of $913 billion.  At least four analysts have target prices for Apple that put its market value above $1 trillion. Drexel Hamilton's White, the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, has a target price of $208, equivalent to a market capitalization of $1.074 trillion. (reut.rs/2z5egB9) No analysts recommend selling Apple shares, but among the seven with “hold” ratings, one of the least enthusiastic is Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang, with a $140 price target.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. “There never appears to be a shortage of chatter about alleged production glitches at Apple but they seem to be able to crank out tens of millions of iPhones each quarter,” BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said in an email. “I also doubt someone interested in a new iPhone will change brands if they have to wait a few months,” he added. Fans and investors are eagerly looking forward to the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 to see whether it will deliver enough new features to spark a new generation to turn to Apple.

The speaker, which can make music suggestions and adjust home temperatures, takes aim at Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa feature and Echo devices. Apple has forecast between $84 billion and $87 billion in revenue for the holiday - mostly driven by sales of its $999 iPhone X - so it’s unlikely that missing a few weeks of sales of its $349 speaker will affect its financial results, Bob O‘Donnell, founder of Technalysis Research, said. The indirect effects will have a stronger negative impact, he said. Apple is working to keep its Siri voice assistant relevant in the face of competition from Amazon’s Alexa and Alphabet Inc’s  Google Assistant, both of which are featured on smart speakers from those companies. People use voice assistants more often on smart speakers than on phones, so even if owners of Amazon or Google speakers  also have an iPhone, there’s a good chance that they’re talking to Alexa or Google Assistant as much or more than Siri.  Apple is also counting on HomePod to boost subscriptions to Apple Music and block the rise of rival Spotify. Smart speakers from Google and Amazon let users give voice commands to play Spotify, but Apple Music does not work on the rival devices.  Apple’s main pitch for its HomePod smart speakers was superior audio quality, but that advantage appears to be slipping: Sonos, which also pitches its speakers’ audio quality for music lovers, now features support for the Alexa voice assistant.  Earlier this year, Amazon announced the Echo Plus, a smart speaker with better audio quality, and Google confirmed to Reuters that its Home Max speaker with improved speakers will  ship in December, though it has not given a specific date. But Apple could still have a surprise or two in store. The company gave scant details about its speaker in June, leaving it room to announce exclusive music content or other unexpected features, said Brian Blau, an analyst with Gartner. “When HomePod comes out, you’ll probably hear some great content from artists that are familiar and popular, and there’s probably going to be some other special aspects as well,” he said.

The first “Apps” episode will be free to anyone who wants to see it on iTunes and the show’s website. Subsequent episodes will be released each Tuesday on Apple Music and available only to the streaming service’s subscribers.     On the show, developers try to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The advisers help contestants build their products and prepare appeals for funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, the first investor in Snapchat.     “The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview. “Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what’s involved. This really shows how that’s possible.”    “Planet of the Apps” came from musician will.i.am, who with producer Ben Silverman had shopped the series to traditional TV players before approaching Apple. Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses.    “I felt like this was a great way to show that app developers or business people are not just white dudes in suits, or white dudes coding,” Alba said.    In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept.

"2017-11-03",2,"By Nivedita Bhattacharjee Nov 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc took a step closer to becoming a trillion dollar company after the tech giant reported a blowout fourth quarter on Thursday and shrugged off concerns related to the $999 iPhone X. Its shares rose almost 4 percent in premarket trading on Friday, on track to add nearly $30 billion to its market capitalization. The company is currently valued at $868 billion. The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast a strong holiday quarter ahead, which will include the much-awaited iPhone X that started selling on Nov. 3. “We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China, driving more than 20 percent iPhone unit growth and a revenue and earnings beat in 2018,” analyst Katy Huberty on Morgan Stanley said. Long lines had already started forming outside Apple stores in Asia as fans flocked to buy the new iPhone. At least five brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Canaccord Genuity making the most bullish move by raising its price target by $15 to $195. The median price target on the stock is $180. With Canaccord’s move, five Wall Street analysts now have target prices for Apple that put its market value above $1 trillion. Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White is still the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters with a target price of $208. Apple’s fourth-quarter results underscored the company’s ability to drive growth not just on iPhones, but across its range of products, analysts said. The company’s suite now includes five different iPhone models, the iPad, the Mac and the Apple Watch as well as its fast-growing services. Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts’ estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Mac and Ipad sales too were above the estimates of most analysts. “Apple’s first-mover advantage and ”easy growth“ from new smartphone adopters is over, but the company appears likely to retain its existing premium customer base,” analysts at Morningstar said.

"2017-05-03",-4,"Driving this growth are online games available through its China App Store, such as current hits “King of Glory”, “Fantasy Westward Journey” and “Nest of Dragons”. These apps are taking on increasing significance as Apple looks to revive growth ahead of the 10-year anniversary of its first iPhone later this year. Graphic - Apple earnings: tmsnrt.rs/2pFiUil China drove around half the revenue growth for Apple’s App Store last year. Apple posted a surprise dip in iPhone sales in the first quarter, and revenue from Greater China dropped for a fifth straight quarter, by 14.1 percent. The iPhone has lost market share in China under competition from local rivals Oppo, Vivo and Huawei. It ranks fourth with around 10 percent. Services, however, were a bright spot. “We had extremely strong services growth during the quarter in China,” CEO Tim Cook told analysts after the results were announced on Tuesday, adding the segment posted “double digit” growth. Revenue from Apple’s China App Store was more last year than that of China’s other app stores combined, according to app analytics firm App Annie. Apple takes a cut of all spending on or within apps via its store. “Most students will spend a few hundred to a few thousand (yuan) on games a year,” said a 22-year-old Beijing university student surnamed Ning, who says the iOS (Apple’s operating system) experience feels more genuine than rivals in China. Apple’s China App Store, which draws some 75 percent of its revenue from games including top-grossing titles like “Clash of Clans”, raked in $2 billion in the last quarter of 2016, and is seen globally as one of the company’s fastest-growing areas. “You never know what will change in the next year,” said Tarun Pathak, director of research firm Counterpoint, referring to the uncertain regulatory environment for new online media. Beijing has ushered in a string of rules in the past year, raising scrutiny on Apple’s services business, and has created new barriers for developers entering the market. In April last year, Apple pulled its iBooks and Movies from China just weeks after they went live, citing regulations. Earlier this year, it also removed the New York Times app from its China App Store after a request from the authorities. Last month, Beijing’s cyber authority said it would call on Apple to answer violations it made in hosting live-streaming apps banned by the government. Apple’s gaming app business has also experienced setbacks due to tightening regulations. Rules introduced last year require a strict and lengthy licensing process for introducing games to Chinese app stores, barring developers outside China who don’t have a local partner.  And the same Chinese smartphone makers who have chipped away at iPhone sales could also increase competition in services. “We can expect [Oppo, Huawei and Vivo] also to go very, very aggressively into the services sector in the coming years which could affect Apple,” said Counterpoint’s Pathak. To stay ahead, Apple has made significant strides in courting developers by slashing approval times for apps entering the store, and allowing developers to increasingly integrate apps with local services including social media. “Apple in China is just better organized (now),” said Thomas Meyer, Shanghai-based co-founder of mobile development firm Mobile Now. “We (now) get support from iOS to integrate  important China APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) like social networks... That’s something in the early days we couldn’t even hope for, it would take months to figure out.” Yet Apple’s services business is still tied to iPhone sales. For App Store users, compelling features in the next iPhone, expected to be launched in September, could make or break the relationship. Consumers like Wang Chunting illustrate the balancing act Apple faces between iPhone sales and services. The 23-year-old Beijing animator spent around 600 yuan  ($87) this year on “Onmyoji”, a popular Chinese role-playing game, and says the lure of iOS games was previously enough for her to buy an iPhone - but she doesn’t expect to upgrade to this year’s new phone. “The iOS gaming experience is better and there’s less blatant pirating than (on rival operating system) Android,... but the price of the iPhone is just too high, it’s just not worth it.” "

"2017-05-23",-1,"Apple Inc wants to expand its contract manufacturer’s facility in the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, a federal minister said on Tuesday, as the iPhone maker seeks a bigger share in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron’s plant in Bengaluru.. Apple, which sold over 50 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 1 percent year-on-year, is looking for new markets as its sales in China have weakened.  Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased program to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. “We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India,” Sundararajan told Reuters, adding that local manufacturing component would have to be increased gradually. Apple has agreed to increase local share in production over a period of time, but there was a difference between the plans of the two sides, she said.   Apple was not immediately available for comment.   India wants Apple to raise value addition share in phases of 3,5,7 and 10 years as the local capacity builds up, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to boost manufacturing. Industry estimates the phased manufacturing program could increase local value addition in mobile phones manufacturing to 40-50 percent in the next three years.          Earlier, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the federal minister for Electronics and IT said government officials were in touch with Apple and other mobile phone manufacturers about expanding facilities and setting up new plants. “It will be a little early to say that India and Apple have agreed on the common ground,” said the official, adding India was ready to work out a roadmap to encourage manufacturing.  Industry estimates total value of mobile phones produced in India touched near 900 billion Indian rupees  ($13.90 billion) compared with 540 billion rupees in the previous year. “We are waiting for Apple to come back,” said Sundararajan.

"2017-06-22",-3,"Apple’s decision, which analysts said posed an existential threat to the company, sent Imagination’s shares plummeting 70 percent on April 3 and they have barely recovered since. The stock jumped as much as 21 percent on Thursday, however, after the sale announcement to 149.5 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of 425 million pounds ($538 million).  Analysts said potential buyers could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various entities from China, while Apple itself could be interested. “Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group,” the company said.  “The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.” Imagination has said it doubted Apple, which accounts for about half of its sales, could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents. Analysts said legal battles were likely and Imagination started a dispute resolution procedure in May with the U.S. giant, which is valued at $761 billion. The British company initially responded to Apple’s decision to walk away by putting two of its main divisions up for sale. “That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer,” said Neil Wilson, Senior Market Analyst, ETX Capital. “Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.” Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed, prompting Apple and Intel to buy stakes and the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012. Apple owns 8 percent of the shares. Imagination struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Analysts at Stifel said they thought interested parties could include those groups that want to develop their own processing technology across platforms such as mobile, wearable tech, vehicles and the so-called Internet of Things. “This could include a coordinated Chinese bid, a hyper-scale vendor from the cloud or some other IP player,” they said.  Imagination said on Thursday it had received indicative proposals for its embedded MIPS technology - processors used in vehicles and home appliances - and its mobile connectivity division Ensigma, the two businesses put up for sale in the wake of the slide in its shares. While Imagination has other clients for its technology, UBS analysts estimated in April that its non-Apple business was worth just 81 million pounds and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013, was worth 77 million pounds. UBS said the company could be worth 110 pence per share on a sum of the parts basis. In May, Jefferies said the wind up value was about 96 pence a share while Morgan Stanley said the company could be worth as little as 106 million pounds, or just 30 pence per share, though its base case was 95 pence. The U.S. investment bank said Imagination’s headquarters was worth 40 million pounds. "

"2017-06-05",-2,"Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them - and buy more toilet paper, too. Viewers want to watch their favorite programs on whatever device they choose. Yet Monday’s announcement, rather than being routine, was the result of a negotiation stretching back at least to 2015 when Amazon stopped selling Apple TVs on its retail site. Amazon had explained that move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who would expect Prime Video to be on devices sold by Amazon. Critics instead saw a negotiating tactic to get Prime Video onto the Apple device, and a prod for people to buy Amazon’s competing Fire TV players. “Whenever these companies try to freeze each other out, the consumer always loses,” said Paul Verna, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Amazon and Apple declined to comment on how their differences have affected customers. The companies said Amazon shows will be available on Apple TV later this year, but did not specify a date. Streaming is not the only example where a spat between Apple and Amazon limited customer choice. Amazon’s popular voice-controlled speaker, the Echo, can be told to play songs from an Amazon music account or even Spotify, but not from Apple Music. Amazon’s Kindle app for Apple’s iPhone lets people read but not buy books, which must be purchased directly from Amazon’s website. According to former Amazon employees, the company at times brings in tangential business concerns as leverage in negotiations. “The outcomes of these deals may factor into future conversations,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. It was not clear how Amazon and Apple came to terms on the video player. Analysts estimate that the ascendance of Prime Video gave Amazon a better starting point for negotiations. Its shows and films have started winning awards, including three Oscars in 2017. The internet video player with most market share, Roku, not only offers Prime Video but has a smaller price tag than Apple TV.  “It put Apple TV at a big disadvantage,” said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV[R]EV. Amazon declined to comment on whether it will again sell Apple TVs. "
"2017-07-06",-22,"Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7.  Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.  Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. "
"2017-05-02",0,"Apple does not break out figures for how many of each model it sells, but executives pointed to the premium-priced iPhone 7 Plus, which sells for up to $969 fully loaded, as the key to boosting the amount it gets on average for each phone. The average selling price of iPhones is important to Apple because the smartphone market is maturing and its growth slowing. Apple’s ability to get more cash for each phone sold is critical to growing its profits. “One of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call on Tuesday, in response to a question about how supply of its top-end phone was constrained during the holiday shopping season. “The demand was much stronger for the 7 Plus than we had predicted, and so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred this past quarter.” The popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus model represents a triumph for Apple with a new departure: packing a unique feature into its most expensive iPhone. The iPhone 6 Plus differed from its smaller sibling only in screen size, but the 7 Plus model has a physically different camera that enables what Apple calls “portrait mode” for taking shots with a blurred background - a feature more commonly found on large, expensive digital cameras. It is a strategy Apple could use again. Many analysts believe the company will reserve certain features for the premium-priced model of its next, eagerly awaited iPhone - such as a higher-quality display - that could sell for more than $1,000. So far, customers seem to be willing to pay more for the extra camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which is one reason that Apple made slightly more revenue selling slightly fewer iPhones in the latest quarter than a year ago, for an average price of $656. That price was 2 percent higher than 12 months ago, the best improvement in a year. During 2016, selling prices even went into a decline, year on year, during the iPhone 6s cycle after soaring on the release of the original iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced larger screens to the Apple lineup for the first time. “The important thing is the average selling price should not fall,” said Anil Doradla, a research analyst with William Blair & Co. “I have full confidence that it won‘t. Apple just doesn’t cut pricing to gain market share. It’s not in their DNA.” (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)"
"2017-05-23",-1,"Apple Inc wants to expand its contract manufacturer’s facility in the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, a federal minister said on Tuesday, as the iPhone maker seeks a bigger share in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron’s plant in Bengaluru.. Apple, which sold over 50 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 1 percent year-on-year, is looking for new markets as its sales in China have weakened.  Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased program to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. “We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India,” Sundararajan told Reuters, adding that local manufacturing component would have to be increased gradually. Apple has agreed to increase local share in production over a period of time, but there was a difference between the plans of the two sides, she said.   Apple was not immediately available for comment.   India wants Apple to raise value addition share in phases of 3,5,7 and 10 years as the local capacity builds up, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to boost manufacturing. Industry estimates the phased manufacturing program could increase local value addition in mobile phones manufacturing to 40-50 percent in the next three years.          Earlier, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the federal minister for Electronics and IT said government officials were in touch with Apple and other mobile phone manufacturers about expanding facilities and setting up new plants. “It will be a little early to say that India and Apple have agreed on the common ground,” said the official, adding India was ready to work out a roadmap to encourage manufacturing.  Industry estimates total value of mobile phones produced in India touched near 900 billion Indian rupees  ($13.90 billion) compared with 540 billion rupees in the previous year. “We are waiting for Apple to come back,” said Sundararajan.

"2017-05-02",-4,"“Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York.   Only about a third of large-cap core mutual funds are ahead of the 6.7 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index for the year to date, leaving portfolio managers struggling to prove their worth at a time when low-priced index funds and exchange traded funds that mimic benchmarks continue to take market share, Rosenbluth said. The UBS ranking was based on institutional investment in individual stocks. The total dollar holdings in a stock were compared to the size of the overall fund portfolio to calculate the stock’s “investor weight.” This was later compared with “the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight.” For its part, global fund managers’ “investor weight” of Apple stood at 1.3 percent while their “active weight” positioning was negative 0.6 percent, UBS data showed. In a regulatory filing, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, up from just from 15.2 million shares three months earlier. Shares of Apple are up about 26.8 percent for the year to date in anticipation of a new iPhone model expected to be released in September marking the 10th anniversary of its flagship product.  Sales of the iPhone, which account for 69.4 percent of Apple’s total revenue, were larger than expected in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, helping mitigate concerns about consumers switching to cheaper alternatives or holding on to their current phones longer. “You’re not seeing a slowdown in demand ahead of a major upgrade year, and there’s a potential for higher costs and margins with the new model,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. Apple reports second-quarter results after the closing bell.  "

"2017-10-30",3,"But positive commentary from analysts on Monday signaled strong demand for the pricey device with pre-orders starting this past Friday. Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results this Thursday. The company provides sales figures in its results. Since the launch of new iPhones on Sept.12, the stock  had fallen 2.5 percent until last Thursday’s close. They rebounded on Friday after Apple said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary phone were “off the charts”.  The stock climbed to $168.07 earlier in the session, adding nearly $26 billion to its market cap and inching it closer to becoming the first company with a trillion dollar valuation. Shares pared gains and were up 1.9 percent at $166.15 mid-day. Daniel Ives, a well-known sector analyst, raised his forecast on Monday for pre-orders by 10 million, and several other analysts talked up sales over the next year. In a note, Ives of research house GBH Insights, raised his pre-order demand expectations for the iPhone X to 50 million units from 40 million, calling the first stage of the iPhone X release a “stellar success”. “With the official launch of iPhone X in Apple retail stores slated for this Friday, Nov. 3, we anticipate very high demand globally with limited supply of iPhone X on hand,” Ives said. Jeffrey Kvaal from brokerage Nomura Instinet, said Apple and U.S. wireless carriers’ pushing out of delivery times for iPhone X orders to 5-6 weeks was longer than for previous phones and pointed to strong demand. Asked by Reuters whether production bottlenecks are causing shipment delays, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth responded: “No, there’s no bottlenecks. This is a company that manages the supply chain well.” However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White, cautioned that the longer wait times for consumers ordering phones may be as much due to the component supply issues, which led Apple to delay the launch of the premium phone until November.  “Although we believe Apple is benefiting from strong demand from the iPhone X, the company is also struggling with supply constraints,” White, who has a buy rating on Apple, said. “A sound debate around the key driver for the surging shipping lead times can be made by reasonable people. Thus we believe it was important for Apple to highlight the demand side of the equation for the iPhone X.” Wall Street is bullish on Apple with 31 of 38 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. Their median price target of $180 projects a market cap of nearly $930 billion for the iPhone maker. "

You should reap that benefit.” Cisco gave few details about the effort, saying in a company blog post the two companies were “collaborating with insurance industry heavyweights ... to offer more robust policies to our customers.” Cisco, a networking company that has increasingly moved into cyber security in recent years, highlighted several other joint efforts with Apple. It rolled out a new security app for iPhones meant to protect against so-called phishing attacks - an email with a malicious link sent under the guise of being legitimate. Cook also said the “fast lane” that Cisco had created in 2015 to speed up Internet connections for iPhones on Cisco routers and switches has been expanded to Mac computers. Long known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in revenue selling to businesses. Apple has also undertaken joint efforts with enterprise software firms IBM (IBM.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) to encourage developers to write business apps for its mobile devices. "

"2017-08-08",-12,"The ITC will make its decision “at the earliest practicable time” and will set a target date for completing its investigation within the next 45 days, the commission said in a statement. Qualcomm filed the complaint in early July, asking U.S. trade regulators to ban certain models of the iPhone that contain so-called broadband modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, that were not made by Qualcomm. Apple began using broadband modem chips made by Intel Corp in the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but says the way Apple uses them in the iPhone does. ”We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. Intel declined to comment. Apple pointed to Chief Executive Tim Cook’s earlier comments that Qualcomm had not yet offered it “fair and reasonable” licensing terms for Qualcomm’s technology. ”I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,“ Cook told investors in May on the company’s earnings call, his most recent public comment on the topic. ”I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” As the ITC considered whether to take up the case, a group representing Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc sided last month with Apple, saying Qualcomm’s request to bar the import of some iPhones would hurt consumers. In turn, Qualcomm accused the group of “a coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting” the trade regulators. It said Apple was free to choose chips from a variety of vendors without necessarily infringing Qualcomm’s patents. The fight before trade regulators in Washington is one of several major legal battles involving Qualcomm and Apple. The two companies have cases pending before separate federal courts in California, and Qualcomm also faces a complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Analysts are watching the ITC case closely because the trade regulator moves more quickly than many courts and could deliver a decision ahead of the pending lawsuits."

"2017-08-02",-3,"But much of that trade has been wiped out as Apple has opened more mainland stores, recent new phone launches have been simultaneous in China and Hong Kong rather than staggered, and local phone brands have increased their share of the world’s biggest smartphone market. “I want to do something else, make a change,” said the shopkeeper amid dozens of shuttered stores. “Relying on iPhones can barely help you make a living now. You can’t really earn much money.”  He didn’t want to be named as he resells phones to so-called parallel traders - who buy goods in Hong Kong to sell at a profit across the border. After 10 years selling phones, the shopkeeper said parallel traders now account for less than half his business, down from 80-90 percent previously. Traders now sell as much to the Middle East and Russia, he said. His tale reflects a broader trend in Hong Kong; the demise of the city’s role as a middleman selling everything from formula milk and iPhones to mainland Chinese concerned about food safety or eager to quickly get their hands on high-tech gadgets. iPhone shipments in China declined year-on-year for a second straight quarter, according to Canalys, a consultancy, adding shipment volume dropped 12 percent in April-June from last year, and 14 percent from the previous quarter. “People are waiting for the next iPhone. We expect shipments to rebound in Q3 and Q4 ... Revenue from iPad and MacBook sales made up for dropping iPhone sales,” said Canalys analyst Mo Jia. According to Canalys’ tracking of smartphone shipments, Apple’s iPhone shipment volume in Hong Kong represented 4.5 percent of that in mainland China in the latest quarter, down from 33 percent just two years ago. In 2009, when there was just a single Apple store in mainland China, Apple shipped more phones to Hong Kong than to the mainland - though many of those found their way across the border in what was a profitable trade for smugglers, and tourists. “Chinese consumers increasingly favor Chinese brands, and Apple is no longer as fashionable in China as it was,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics analyst. He added that the next iPhone, expected later this year, should give Apple a bounce, but “the outlook for Apple in China remains very challenging.”     For graphic on Apple earnings click:  here "
"2017-06-05",0,"Apple’s Siri assistant will be integrated into the $349 speaker, and can make music recommendations that pair with the company’s Apple Music service, send text messages, check news and sports scores and control compatible home gadgets like lightbulbs and thermostats. HomePod users may initially be constrained by Siri’s lack of capabilities as compared to Alexa, which also boasts the ability to order millions of Amazon products as well as food from restaurants like Domino‘s.  Apple is expected to announce plans this week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, but initial changes were expected to add just a small number of capabilities. The HomePod speaker stands just under seven inches (18 cm) tall and is covered in fabric mesh that will come in white or gray. A computer processor will tune sound to the room and beam specific parts of music, like a singer’s voice, toward the listener.  Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December.  The speaker, while expected by some industry watchers, marked Apple’s first new product announcement since the Apple Watch in September 2014. As a music-playing device, it will also be a challenger to Sonos, whose wifi-controlled speakers are used by many smartphone users for home entertainment.  A new Siri interface on the Apple Watch will also blend users’ calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked, the company said.  The technology, a feature of the wildly successfully smartphone game Pokemon Go, overlays digital information on real-world images and is seen as an area in which the keenly awaited 10th-anniversary iPhone can stand out from competitors.  New indoor maps of areas like malls and airports indicated that Apple might be laying groundwork to display information over images of those places in the future. The company also rolled out tools for developers to create augmented reality applications for iPhones and iPads. To show the tools off, Apple invited Wingnut AR, the company formed by “Lord of the Rings” director Peter Jackson, on stage.  "
"2017-10-17",-38,"Instead, Qualcomm may be looking to frustrate the tech giant through a lengthy legal fight that could last years in China as it seeks to gain leverage in the firms’ global standoff over royalty payments it demands, intellectual property lawyers said. Qualcomm said this week it had filed the suits in Beijing’s intellectual property court, claiming patent infringement against Apple. If successful Apple could be blocked from selling or manufacturing some iPhones in China. The two firms are fighting on multiple fronts around the globe from the United States to Europe and Asia, but the China case is particularly thorny because the iPhone is almost entirely made in the country by contract manufacturer Foxconn. “Effectively - if they get an injunction - you would have a worldwide injunction that would block (Apple) exports from China,” said Erick Robinson, director of patent litigation for Beijing East IP and a former director of patents for Qualcomm. “China is still unpredictable and Apple has a ton to lose.” Apple has antitrust suits against Qualcomm in the United States as well as nearly a dozen in the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Taiwan alleging that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for its technology.  In return, Qualcomm is seeking injunctions against Apple in the United States with complaints to the International Trade Commission as well as filing complaints in Germany. Now it has set it sights on China. But putting Apple away in China is a tough act, lawyers said.  Apple suppliers employ hundreds of thousands of people in China, so authorities may be wary of hitting jobs with a ban on production. More to the point, lawyers said it was unlikely either firm would allow the case to get to an injunction, speculating that  Qualcomm’s main aim was to increase its leverage over Apple at the negotiating table over any final settlement. A Shanghai-based intellectual property lawyer said it would take “a year or two” to get to the point where the threat of injunction was imminent, but that eventually it would get “too close for comfort”.  ”The consequences are just dire if (an injunction) were to actually happen, the lawyer, who asked not to be named because Qualcomm and Apple were clients of his firm, said.  “That is very significant leverage Qualcomm would have over Apple.”  “The patents we’re asserting in these complaints are non-cellular wireless technologies that Apple uses in its iPhones,” Trimble told Reuters. “The patents are a few examples of the many Qualcomm technologies that Apple is using without paying Qualcomm.” Apple, which has said previously it pays fair and reasonable rates for the patents it uses, said Qualcomm’s claim is “meritless.” “Regulators around the world have found Qualcomm guilty of abusing their position for years. This claim is meritless and, like their other courtroom maneuvers, we believe this latest legal effort will fail,” said a Apple spokeswoman in Shanghai. Chinese regulators fined Qualcomm $975 million in 2015 over antitrust violations. Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission said last week it would fine the firm $774 million over similar issues. ‘MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION’  Lawyers said Apple would likely file more unfair competition or anti-trust cases against Qualcomm in Chinese courts, or seek to get the relevant patents invalidated by the Chinese patent office. The iPhone maker could also seek to have the patent cases held up by the Beijing IP court while the patent invalidation decision was being made. The cases would then go through a series of hearings at the Beijing court before any injunction. “Given the known circumstances and the parties, an injunction is unlikely to be forthcoming in this type of situation,” said Elliot Papageorgiou, head of intellectual property at Clyde & Co China. Last year, a Beijing court banned Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, saying they were too similar in design to the Shenzhen Baili 100C smartphone. The ruling was overturned this year in favor of Apple. Injunction requests, often used to boost leverage in negotiations, have not proved hugely effective in patent litigations, however. By the time a court makes a ruling on such cases, the products involved in the suit often become outdated and defending firms introduce new models that do not use disputed patents.    “The reality is both parties should get together and avoid mutually assured destruction,” said Beijing-based Robinson, who estimated it would be 18 months before any potential injunction. “Apple has been giving Qualcomm trouble in the United States and in China; Qualcomm has the patent portfolio to completely block the manufacturing chain for Apple if that’s what they want to do.” "

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country. Apple did not respond to an e-mail query asking about whether it was committed to the project.  A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple in July announced it would build its second EU data center there. The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly. "
"2017-09-19",3,"The most visible changes will come to App Store. The App Store is the backbone of Apple’s services segment, which brought in $21.5 billion in revenue in the past nine months, a 19 percent increase over the previous year and a bright spot as overall sales grew only 5 percent. The store has been redesigned to give app developers more space for images and text to describe their software. Developers have long grumbled that their software is hard to find in Apple’s store unless users type in the precise name of the app or follow a link to it. “The redesign make it much cleaner and speaks to the pain point of the store: You had so many apps that if you didn’t know exactly what you were looking for, it was really hard to find anything,” said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Most of that revenue comes in the form of so-called in-app purchases, where gamers make purchases of tokens, gems and other digital items to unlock new parts of the game. “It’s really the gift that keep on giving from the developer perspective,” Milanesi said. But perhaps the biggest change in iOS 11 will the debut of augmented reality apps, or AR, in which digital images float over the real word. Apple has made much of those a capabilities, but an ostensibly minor feature may help AR apps spread: Screen recording. In testing, Adam Debreczeni, maker of an app that lets users see a three-dimensional map of a fitness activity like a bicycle ride or run they’ve gone on, was surprised at how enthusiastically users took to sharing screen recordings of AR apps like his. “I think that’s going to help AR games go viral and get better distribution,” he said.

"2017-11-03",3,"With supplies potentially tight, some Australian purchasers were already planning to sell their phones for as much as A$3,000, nearly double the A$1,579 selling price. Apple shares rose 4 percent in after-hours trading to hit an all-time high, with analysts lavishing praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook and speculating on when Apple might become the first public company worth a trillion dollars. The earnings demonstrate how Apple is able to drive growth across an ever-expanding product line that now includes five different iPhone models along with the iPad, the Mac, the Apple Watch and a suite of fast-growing services offerings. “We had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones,” Cook said on a call with analysts. “We tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone, but may have a more limited budget.” Just a few weeks ago, Apple appeared to be facing a rare stumble with a delay in the iPhone X launch and rumors of production problems that could limit supply. But Apple executives on Thursday shrugged off the concerns as Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the company was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing. Analysts have been eager to see whether Apple can meet demand for the iPhone X during the crucial holiday quarter, with most saying it will likely take it until next year or early spring to do so. “Where the demand curve and supply curve are going to intersect, we do not know. It does not have a predecessor product,” Maestri told Reuters.  The Cupertino, California-based company’s market capitalization of about $868 billion already makes it the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company. There are still questions around supplies of the new phone and longer-term demand.  Bob O‘Donnell, head of Techanalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple is not able to fill demand for iPhone X over the holiday quarter, it would push buyers to wait until Apple’s March quarter, by which time they may have spent their money elsewhere. Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts’ estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. However, average selling prices of $618 fell short of forecasts of $638. The company’s net income rose to $10.71 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the quarter, from $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. That beat the average analyst estimate of $1.87 per share. Apple forecast a gross margin of 38 percent to 38.5 percent, higher than many analysts expected because new products often have higher costs. Maestri attributed the margin strength to Apple’s growing services business, which brought in $8.5 billion in revenue compared to analyst estimates of $7.5 billion. That included a favorable $640 million adjustment, though Apple officials did not elaborate. The $28.85 billion revenue from iPhone sales accounted for nearly 55 percent of total revenue, which rose 12.2 percent to $52.58 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $50.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple also said it returned to revenue growth in China, bringing in $9.8 billion compared with $8 billion a year ago, driven by double-digit unit sale increases of the iPhone. Maestri also told Reuters the company had doubled its revenue in India during the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not give any details. "
"2017-09-28",-3,"By Stephen Nellis Sept 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has received more than four times as many national-security related requests from the U.S. government in the first half of this year versus a year ago, according to a company report on Thursday. Apple said it had received between 13,250 and 13,499 national security requests affecting between 9,000 and 9,249 users. That compares with a range of 2,750 and 2,999 requests affecting between 2,000 and 2,249 users in the first half of 2016. (apple.co/2xO5fLM) The requests come in the form of so-called National Security Letters, or NSLs, and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple and other companies report ranges because government rules prevent disclosing precise numbers. Apple declined to comment beyond the figures it released. The disclosures are voluntary, and firms like Microsoft Corp , Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc have yet to report any figures for 2017. In the past, those companies have issued more detailed reports, for example separating FISA requests and NSLs. The government requires they wait six months to report that level of information. It was not immediately clear what drove the increase in requests to Apple. But Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that the number of government requests to technology companies has been increasing since 2014, when data first started to become available as part of a settlement between technology firms and the government. “There’s not a huge track record here, but you can start to make a simple graph. The trend does seem to be upward,” Crocker said. Crocker also said the higher requests to Apple could represent it coming in line with its peers. Despite Apple’s huge user base - it has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones - the number of requests to it had been relatively low compared with firms like Google or Microsoft. National security letters are a type of government subpoena for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. "

Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform.   Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called “Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview” whose objective is “to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.” “Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,” the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple’s development platform “will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.” The document does not include detail on how Apple’s self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple’s three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer’s cars. "
"2017-06-22",2,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc will soon start selling wireless plans from Virgin Mobile USA, the first new carrier offered by the iPhone maker’s since 2013, the companies said on Wednesday. Virgin Mobile USA, a subsidiary of Sprint that licenses its name from the Virgin Group co-founded by Richard Branson, struck the deal as part of a broader revamp of its business that will see it ditch Android phones in the coming years and become what it claims is the first iPhone-only network. Virgin Mobile USA will first be offered in Apple’s stores then online. Apple currently offers AT&T , Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, the last of which was added in 2013.  Branson, wearing an Apple Watch on his left wrist and traditional watch on the other, told Reuters in an interview he sees similarities between the Apple and Virgin brands because both advocate for human rights and other social causes. Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts “has been tremendously supportive of this and loves the proposition,” Branson told Reuters before a launch event in San Francisco. “We were knocking on (an) open door.” Virgin Mobile USA piggybacks on Sprint’s network. Virgin customers pay full price for their phone upfront but are not locked into a contract. Under the deal with Apple, customers who buy a new or refurbished iPhone from Virgin or Apple will get up to one year of service for $1, with service costing $50 per month after that. The refurbished phones will come with an Apple warranty. Because Virgin does not spend money on its own physical stores or big advertising campaigns to acquire customers, the company believes it can make a profit off much less revenue than larger carriers, Virgin Mobile USA CEO Dow Draper said. “The amount of money we have in these customers from an acquisition standpoint is minimal,” Draper said. “Once they make one ($50) payment, we’re back in good shape. Because of the strategy with going through Apple retail and Virgin Mobile’s site, we’ve got a really efficient cost structure.” Virgin Mobile USA also hopes the iPhone push will bring it in line with the rest of Virgin’s brands. Virgin Mobile USA is seen as downmarket because it offers pre-paid phones. Most of Virgin’s other business, such as airlines, hotels and wine clubs, target more upscale consumers. "

Apple, a company known for its precisely coordinated product launches, declined to explain the delays, but said in a statement that “Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year.” The series is an adaptation of a segment than runs during CBS’ “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and sees him driving with a celebrity and singing a medley of songs. A representative for CBS Television Studios said in an email on Monday: “We’re excited about our ‘Carpool Karaoke’ for Apple Music, and look forward to everyone seeing it later this year.” In January, Corden told reporters at a Television Critics Association panel that he was “incredibly proud” that it would be Apple Music’s first show. Launched in mid-2015, Apple Music has struggled to gain traction. The company said that the service, which sells for $9.99 a month and is heavily promoted to iPhone users, had 20 million subscribers at the end of 2016. Rival streaming platform Spotify, which offers both a free version and a $9.99 monthly subscription, said in March it had 50 million subscribers. Apple Music has primarily offered streaming music to its subscribers, but hoped additional exclusive video content would lure new customers. Apple has said that each of the 16 half-hour episodes it is planning of “Carpool Karaoke” would pair two celebrities spending the day driving around together. Apple Music has also announced plans for a reality show, “Planet of the Apps,” which Cue said was due this spring.

"2017-09-08",-1,"However, if Western Digital remains a minority investor in the business, Apple, a top customer for Toshiba chips, is offering around 50 billion yen ($460 million) to a group including the U.S. firm to help finance a bid, one source said. Apple declined to comment, while a Western Digital spokeswoman said it could not comment on details of the talks. Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Western Digital, which jointly invests in Toshiba’s key chip plant, is leading a $17-18 billion bid for the chip business, sources familiar with the talks have said.   Sources said earlier in the week that Western Digital offered to step back from the consortium’s financing in return for a stronger position in their joint venture, and was roping in Apple for funding. But it has been unclear whether other parties in the consortium, which also includes U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) as well as Japanese government-backed investors,  would pay more to cover for the 15 billion yen that Western Digital had previously planned to pay as part of the bid. Sources have said Western Digital does want a future stake in the chip business, although it was unclear how much.  Toshiba executives, fearing that Western Digital was angling to eventually take over the chip business, are demanding that the U.S. company promise to limit the size of its stake in the company, sources said, requesting anonymity as talks were confidential. Toshiba’s board is now aiming to reach a final agreement with the consortium by Wednesday, sources have said.  The company is under pressure to clinch a deal soon and complete regulatory approvals by the end of the fiscal year in March to ensure it does not report negative net worth, or liabilities exceeding assets, for a second year running - a scenario that could result in delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Last week, Toshiba said it had not yet narrowed the pool of suitors and was also looking at a bid from U.S. private equity firm Bain as well as one from Taiwan’s Foxconn (2317.TW).  All three bids have involved Apple, Toshiba’s key memory chip customer, sources said. ($1 = 107.6800 yen) "
"2017-08-01",2,"The U.S. tech giant has been in talks with Indian officials since May of last year, when CEO Tim Cook and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to set up a production base in the country that goes beyond just assembling the devices, as happens today. The two sides have been discussing a list of “prerequisites” that Apple submitted in October, including duty exemption on raw materials for manufacturing components and capital equipment for 15 years for it to make iPhones from scratch in India. The company has told the government it would be bringing in a host of these ancillary units when it sets up operations to cater to India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets, a top government official said. “They want the same treatment to be given to the component manufacturers; the tax concessions, they want everything. But then some kind of policy will have to be evolved,” the official said.  Apple declined to comment. The demand could further delay Apple’s plans to penetrate the Indian market, the world’s third largest for smartphones behind the United States and China, but where it has only a 2 percent share. The company is looking to India after sales in the Greater China region, once a major growth driver, slid 14 percent year-on-year to $10.7 billion in the three months ended April 1. In May, Apple, working with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Winstron, began assembling the iPhone SE in Bengaluru. The plan that Modi and Cook ordered the two sides to work on, however, envisages manufacturing a full range of iPhones for the domestic market, as well as for export.  It would also spawn a vast network of suppliers, in the way that India’s auto ancillary sector took off to feed Maruti Suzuki India’s (MRTI.NS) production line over three decades ago. Another official, who has led efforts to secure foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, said Apple’s proposal to build its phones in India was being examined favorably by the government. “My view is that India needs to support Apple to create an ecosystem, which was done for Maruti. This helped to build the automobile and auto component industry in India,” the official said, seeking anonymity in line with government policy. “Initial support will pay rich dividends in the long run and facilitate innovation, design and manufacturing of electronics components in India,” the official added. Apple competitors such as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and China’s Oppo could also benefit from a broader policy review as they, too, currently have predominantly assembly operations in India. Another government official familiar with the matter said it would be difficult for India to agree to Apple’s request for a customs holiday for just its own operations in India. Customs duties have already been slashed in order to make India a hub for handset assembly lines, the official said. That move has encouraged phone makers to set up such facilities in India, and so the duty structure cannot be changed for one company, the official said. "

"2017-11-07",-4,"European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid. “I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organised, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager told a news briefing on the sidelines of an international tech summit in Lisbon. “We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said. Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland. “We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said. She also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any investigation. “That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.” The European Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple. “We have no indication when it comes to the time perspective of Apple’s recovery. We do have from the Irish government the progress made,” she said. "
"2017-11-21",1,"Both Apple and Dublin are appealing the original ruling, saying the iPhone maker’s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. “We’ve indicated to them (Apple) that we want the escrow account established and we want funds to be paid into the escrow account without further delay,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament. “We do not want to be in the situation where the Irish government has to take Apple to court because the European Commission is taking the Irish government to court. I think that message is understood and I’d anticipate progress in the coming weeks.” The Commission said last month the deadline for Ireland to implement its decision had been Jan. 3 this year and that, until the aid was recovered, the company continued to benefit from an illegal advantage. Ireland, which described the Commission’s move to take it to court as “extremely regrettable,” said it had been in constant contact with the Commission and Apple for more than a year and was close to setting up an escrow account to hold the funds.  Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe also said at the time that, in addition to work on the escrow account, the government was in “commercially sensitive” talks with Apple about the exact terms of the transfer.

"2017-09-20",-1,"While Apple must convince buyers to fork out nearly $1,000 for its high-end model, challengers are tilting at the luxury market, offering similar features for less money. Chinese vendors, formerly seen as churning out cheap phones with copycat innovation, have upped their quality game and now control nearly half the global mobile market. By cramming high-end features into affordable devices, and using a canny mix of promotion, advertising and retail reach, they have also won over some loyal Apple users. “Huawei is seen as a relevant competitor to Apple and Samsung (by) covering all major price points and placing big investments in marketing and sales,” said a spokeswoman for MediaMarktSaturn, Europe’s biggest electronics retailer. She said Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and TCL - all Chinese firms - were among the top-10 best-selling smartphones in its stores. Chinese manufacturers’ rapid growth has been fueled by strong domestic sales, but they now export 40 percent of their smartphones, almost double the number just three years ago, according to CLSA.  Huawei, whose smartphone shipments to Europe jumped more than 50 percent in the first half of this year, is poised to overtake Apple as the world’s second-largest vendor.  The Chinese firm’s confidence was on show in a short Facebook video ad ahead of its “RealAIphone” launch next month, using a clown to poke fun at Apple’s facial recognition feature that unlocks the new iPhone. Huawei plans to unveil its top-of-the-line Mate 10 phone on Oct. 16, with artificial intelligence-powered features such as instant translation and image recognition. And media reports speculate the phone will have an edge-to-edge screen, and undercut the iPhone on price. Huawei declined to comment. With their growing scale and the flattening of hardware improvements, other Chinese firms are also looking to crack the high-end smartphone market. “Chinese brands with growing scale, access to the same supply chain, rising components buying power, aggressive marketing and value-for-money offerings have stalled Apple’s growth rate and nullified the differentiation points,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint. Apple declined to comment beyond what their executives have said publicly about why they hold off on certain technologies. “The biggest challenge they (Chinese firms) face would be proving to consumers their products and brand are worth paying that much for,” said Xiaohan Tay, an analyst at research firm IDC.  “Apple has taken years to build that premium brand image, and Samsung too. If they can pay a little more to purchase an Apple or Samsung phone, most consumers may still continue to do that.” In the $600-plus segment, Apple has 63 percent market share, against just 3 percent for Huawei, and the U.S. firm’s retention rate of around 82 percent, versus Huawei’s 52 percent, suggests it will be tough for Chinese firms to raise their prices, according to UBS. The average selling price of smartphones from the top-3 Chinese makers - Huawei, Oppo and Vivo - is just $248, or two-thirds less than the cheapest iPhone 8. Yet experts say the threat of competition is real, especially as buyers pay more attention to smartphone apps than hardware features. “How much impact would a $1,000 iPhone really have on UX (user experience) of WhatsApp, or YouTube, or Snapchat?” said Sameer Singh, founder of research firm Tech-Thoughts. “The most popular apps being available on both platforms (Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android) really makes the experience a bit of a wash, making it harder to justify the price point based just on features. This isn’t all that different from the PC industry 10-20 years ago. At one point, a PC was a PC irrespective of the manufacturer.” "

"2017-05-03",-4,"Driving this growth are online games available through its China App Store, such as current hits “King of Glory”, “Fantasy Westward Journey” and “Nest of Dragons”. These apps are taking on increasing significance as Apple looks to revive growth ahead of the 10-year anniversary of its first iPhone later this year. Graphic - Apple earnings: tmsnrt.rs/2pFiUil China drove around half the revenue growth for Apple’s App Store last year. Apple posted a surprise dip in iPhone sales in the first quarter, and revenue from Greater China dropped for a fifth straight quarter, by 14.1 percent. The iPhone has lost market share in China under competition from local rivals Oppo, Vivo and Huawei. It ranks fourth with around 10 percent. Services, however, were a bright spot. “We had extremely strong services growth during the quarter in China,” CEO Tim Cook told analysts after the results were announced on Tuesday, adding the segment posted “double digit” growth. Revenue from Apple’s China App Store was more last year than that of China’s other app stores combined, according to app analytics firm App Annie. Apple takes a cut of all spending on or within apps via its store. “Most students will spend a few hundred to a few thousand (yuan) on games a year,” said a 22-year-old Beijing university student surnamed Ning, who says the iOS (Apple’s operating system) experience feels more genuine than rivals in China. Apple’s China App Store, which draws some 75 percent of its revenue from games including top-grossing titles like “Clash of Clans”, raked in $2 billion in the last quarter of 2016, and is seen globally as one of the company’s fastest-growing areas. “You never know what will change in the next year,” said Tarun Pathak, director of research firm Counterpoint, referring to the uncertain regulatory environment for new online media. Beijing has ushered in a string of rules in the past year, raising scrutiny on Apple’s services business, and has created new barriers for developers entering the market. In April last year, Apple pulled its iBooks and Movies from China just weeks after they went live, citing regulations. Earlier this year, it also removed the New York Times app from its China App Store after a request from the authorities. Last month, Beijing’s cyber authority said it would call on Apple to answer violations it made in hosting live-streaming apps banned by the government. Apple’s gaming app business has also experienced setbacks due to tightening regulations. Rules introduced last year require a strict and lengthy licensing process for introducing games to Chinese app stores, barring developers outside China who don’t have a local partner.  And the same Chinese smartphone makers who have chipped away at iPhone sales could also increase competition in services. “We can expect [Oppo, Huawei and Vivo] also to go very, very aggressively into the services sector in the coming years which could affect Apple,” said Counterpoint’s Pathak. To stay ahead, Apple has made significant strides in courting developers by slashing approval times for apps entering the store, and allowing developers to increasingly integrate apps with local services including social media. “Apple in China is just better organized (now),” said Thomas Meyer, Shanghai-based co-founder of mobile development firm Mobile Now. “We (now) get support from iOS to integrate  important China APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) like social networks... That’s something in the early days we couldn’t even hope for, it would take months to figure out.” Yet Apple’s services business is still tied to iPhone sales. For App Store users, compelling features in the next iPhone, expected to be launched in September, could make or break the relationship. Consumers like Wang Chunting illustrate the balancing act Apple faces between iPhone sales and services. The 23-year-old Beijing animator spent around 600 yuan  ($87) this year on “Onmyoji”, a popular Chinese role-playing game, and says the lure of iOS games was previously enough for her to buy an iPhone - but she doesn’t expect to upgrade to this year’s new phone. “The iOS gaming experience is better and there’s less blatant pirating than (on rival operating system) Android,... but the price of the iPhone is just too high, it’s just not worth it.” "
"2017-06-02",2,"Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment.  But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino‘s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers.  Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.”  The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” "

Qualcomm also slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, to exclude royalty revenue from Apple’s contract manufacturers. The company said it now expects current-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had expected previously.

However, the watch’s standout feature - which allows users to make calls without an iPhone - has turned out to be a cause for concern due to a connectivity glitch. ""Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn't function like it was supposed to, I can't recommend buying it — and paying the monthly cell fee — based on promises,"" Verge reviewer Lauren Goode wrote.

"2017-10-13",-13,"“These games valorise and normalise the emerging tyranny of Duterte’s presidency and his government’s disregard for human rights principles,” the Asian Network of People who Use Drugs (ANPUD) said in an open letter to Apple’s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The group listed 131 organizations from numerous countries as supportive of the Oct. 10 complaint to Apple, among them groups working on human rights, youth and drug policy reform. They urged Apple to issue an apology for hosting such “insensitive content”. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in Duterte’s 15-month-old war on drugs, a campaign that has caused international alarm. Human rights groups say state-sponsored executions are taking place, an assertion the authorities vehemently reject. The group said games such as “Fighting Crime 2”, “Duterte knows Kung Fu”, “Duterte Running Man Challenge”, “Tsip Bato” and “Duterte Vs Zombies” “might seem harmless and fun” but were offensive and distasteful because in reality, murder and impunity had prevailed. “Duterte Running Man Challenge” was not available for download on Friday, and three of the app developers could not be reached for comment. Ben Joseph Banta, a managing partner of Ranida Games, which developed “Tsip Bato”, said the game sought to discourage drug use with the use of banner messages opposing drugs that were visible to players. “The aim of our game is not to promote violence,” Banta said in an emailed response, adding that it featured “supplemental digital content against the use of illegal drugs.”  “We understand the human rights groups and we’re very much open to make changes in the game in order to remove the stigma that the game is promoting violence,” he said.

"2017-11-06",-1,"The finding is surprising because technology products tend to become more profitable as they age and the parts for them drop in cost. The iPhone X is a brand new design that went on sale on Friday, to apparently strong demand, while the iPhone 8 is an update on last year’s iPhone 7, which itself was similar to the iPhone 6 released in 2014. Apple declined to comment on TechInsights’ analysis. Apple is unique in the electronics industry for its ability to charge a premium price for its latest devices and for its ability to maintain that price even when selling devices through third parties like telecom carriers, said Al Cowsky, the costing analyst for TechInsights, which planned to post the results to its site late on Monday. “Apple can be different here because they are the 800 pound gorilla,” Cowsky said. Several of Apple’s design choices for the iPhone X pushed up its price. In particular, its 5.8-inch (14.8 cm) edge-to-edge display and associated parts cost $65.50, compared with $36 for the iPhone 8’s 4.7-inch display, the analysis found. That is largely because the iPhone 8 uses older LCD technology, while the iPhone X uses what is called “Super AMOLED” technology, which allows for more vivid colors and a thinner overall design. Another pricey choice was the stainless steel chassis of the iPhone X, which cost $36 versus $21.50 for the aluminum housing of the iPhone 8. Cowsky said the steel is less likely than aluminum to bend when flexed, a problem that dogged the iPhone 6 when it came out. “This is their lesson learned from that,” he said. "

"2017-10-23",-16,"The three Apple patents covered design elements of the iPhone such as its black rectangular front face, rounded corners, and colorful grid of icons for programs and apps. Koh’s order is a setback for Apple, which called a retrial unnecessary and said the award should be confirmed. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Silicon Valley has closely followed the 6-1/2-year-old case. Companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have said an Apple win would encourage owners of design patents to sue for huge, unfair awards on products containing hundreds of features that are costly to develop. The $399 million represented profit from Samsung’s sales of infringing smartphones, though the South Korean company has said it deserved reimbursement if it prevailed in the litigation. It was part of a $548 million payment that Samsung made to Apple in December 2015. The legal dispute concerned whether the “article of manufacture” for which Samsung owed damages included its entire smartphones, or only parts that infringed Apple patents. Without deciding that question, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court last Dec. 6 that “the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product.” In Sunday’s order, Koh said the jury instructions at the original 2012 trial inaccurately stated the law on that issue. She said Samsung may have been prejudiced if jurors were prevented from considering whether any infringement covered “something other than the entire phone.” Apple contended that the jury instructions were “not erroneous,” and said it had proved that Samsung applied its patented designs to its “entire phones.” Jurors initially awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced. Samsung, in a statement, welcomed a new trial, calling it “a historic opportunity to determine how the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance on design patent damages will be implemented.” The case is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-01846.

"2017-10-18",-1,"The Predix software connects sensor-laden industrial machines like wind turbines, jet engines and elevators to data centers, so that streams of information from the machines can be analyzed to help predict failures and make the machines run more cost effectively.  GE expects the software to help generate $12 billion in digital revenue by 2020, though it took a two-month “time-out” earlier this year to iron out technical problems.  Now with the help of the new software built with Apple, which GE plans to release on Oct. 26, more information from Predix will be available to the on-the-ground managers of factories and power plants who work most closely with GE’s equipment, said Kevin Ichhpurani, executive vice president of global ecosystem and channels at GE Digital. For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call. “These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate,” Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview. As part of arrangements between the two companies, GE plans to make iPhones and iPads the standard mobile devices for its 330,000 employees and will also offer Mac desktop computers as a choice for them. In return, Apple will help promote GE’s Predix software to Apple’s enterprise customers. Apple’s salespeople will be trained on Predix’s capabilities and will promote the software in sales situations alongside iOS devices, Susan Prescott, vice president of product market at Apple, told Reuters. Over the past several years, Apple has courted business software firms such as Accenture PLC, International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, Deloitte and SAP SE in an effort to move business applications over to iOS devices and make them easier to use in corporate settings.

Apple’s “Carpool Karaoke” is based on the popular segment from CBS’ “The Late, Late Show with James Corden,” in which Corden joins guests such as Adele in sing-a-longs while driving.  Apple Music, which costs $9.99 a month for an individual membership and has 27 million subscribers, will release two “Carpool” episodes weekly except for the premiere and finale, released as standalone episodes, of the 20-part series.  Apple’s deep pockets piqued Hollywood’s attention as it entered the original programming race and poached two Sony Pictures Television executives.  Cue said “Planet of the Apps,” where app developers pitch to celebrity mentors, had led to new customers signing up for free three-month Apple Music trials, and he hoped “Carpool Karaoke” will continue to draw subscribers.  For those who signed up to Apple Music in June, the “Carpool Karaoke” series may sway them to convert to a paying membership. The premiere features Corden and actor-singer Smith singing Smith’s hits and surprising star-struck guests at a wedding party. Other pairings include comedian Billy Eichner with Metallica, Miley Cyrus with her family and “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah with singer Shakira.   Corden, who appears in some episodes of Apple’s “Carpool Karaoke,” said partnering with the technology company was a “no-brainer.” The series offered an opportunity to include celebrities that he said had asked to do the segment on “The Late, Late Show.”  “We really wanted to try and keep (‘Carpool Karaoke’) in that rarefied air,” Corden said.  “We started thinking if all of these names are desperate to do it, I wonder if there’s a world in which we could find a sister show for it that lives somewhere else, not on network television.”      Apple is competing in a crowded field against companies including Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc shelling out billions of dollars a year to stream dramas and comedies. The rising costs of producing video content is “concerning,” Cue said, but he added that there’s an “incredible wealth of talent and opportunity.”  “It’s easier to create content than it has ever been,” he said.

"2017-09-13",-3,"CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Chief Executive Tim Cook called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” The launch contained few surprises, with leaked details on the phone and other products including an updated Apple Watch proving largely accurate. But the iPhone X’s $999 price still raised eyebrows, and its Nov. 3 ship date prompted questions about possible supply constraints ahead of the holiday season. Investors and fans have viewed the 10th-anniversary iPhone launch as an opportunity for Apple to refresh a smartphone lineup that had lagged the competition in new features. Last year the company’s revenue declined when many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. The new Apple Watch for the first time will be able to make calls and access the internet without the customer carrying an iPhone -- a major upgrade that one analyst predicted would more than double watch sales.  The iPhone X has wireless charging, an infrared camera and hardware for facial recognition, which replaces the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button is also gone, and users instead tap the device to wake it up. Apple normally ships new products within a week or two of announcing them, though the company said the later date was consistent with earlier guidance to investors. “It’s great to have a product but we’d have liked it sooner rather than later, more like the beginning of October or mid- October,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Apple shares closed down 0.4 percent. They had traded as much as 1 percent higher during the launch event before reversing course. The shares are up almost 40 percent on the year. Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, said he was not worried about the ship date and liked the new phones features, but also flagged a lack of surprises. “It’s sell on the news,” he said. “They didn’t talk about the evolution of Apple beyond the iPhone and into artificial intelligence.” The screen on the iPhone X is about the size of the current iPhone 7 plus, though the phone is smaller. It features richer colors thanks to a new screen technology called OLED that other vendors are also rolling out.  But in an embarrassing moment for Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, the face ID unlocking did not work on his first attempt during the on-stage presentation. Wireless carriers in the United States, whose fierce battle for customers could tempt them into renewing the practice of subsidizing phones, immediately began to offer discounts. T-Mobile US Inc said customers on a payment plan can trade in their iPhone 6 or newer and receive up to $300 off over 24 months.  AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, the dominant mobile carriers in the United States, have not yet disclosed their pricing plans. Apple also introduced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which resemble the iPhone 7 line but have a glass back for wireless charging. The company said it was working on a new device, called the AirPower, that would charge all newer Apple products.  The wireless charging uses a standard called Qi, also used by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which will likely solidify that technology as the industry standard.  The new phones all feature Apple’s first proprietary graphics processor, which provides greater speed, improved cameras and some features for augmented reality apps.  The company had previously used graphics chips from Imagination Technologies Group Plc, which put itself up for sale earlier this year after Apple said it would make its own technology.   The cheapest of the iPhone 8 models have 64 gigabytes of memory, up from 32 gigabytes in previous models, and will sell for $699 and $799. Apple also noted that for budget-conscious shoppers, there is now a $349 iPhone SE, similar to the iPhone 5.  The bump-up in memory for the new phones should help suppliers of memory chips, and Apple is now angling to own a piece of the memory-chip business being sold by Toshiba Corp The new Series 3 watch will cost $399 and support a range of third-party apps. Apple has never released numbers on watch sales, but analyst Gene Munster with Loup Ventures forecast the company would sell 26 million in 2018. Also featured at the launch event was an upgraded Apple TV that will support the high-resolution display known as 4K and will feature more programming options as Apple steps up efforts to cut content deals and produce its own shows.

"2017-05-03",-3,"Cook also said Apple plans to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps, and will release more details about the effort this summer. The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the United States. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China.  In February during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its U.S. suppliers, which include firms like 3M Co (MMM.N) and Corning Inc (GLW.N), the first time Apple has disclosed the metric. Apple is highlighting its U.S. presence at the same time lawmakers consider a major tax proposal by Trump that would let Apple, along with other large companies, bring back accumulated profits from overseas at potentially lower tax rates. Ninety-three percent of Apple’s $256.8 billion cash is held overseas. Cook, who met with lawmakers in Washington earlier this year to discuss tax policy and technology issues, said that Apple would have to borrow the cash for its U.S. manufacturing investment fund and said he was hopeful Trump administration would address the repatriation issue. Cook stopped short of saying Apple would bring some of its cash back into the United States if Trump’s tax proposal was enacted. “To invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis. So I think the administration, you saw they’re really getting this and want to bring this (cash) back. And I hope that comes to pass,” Cook said in response to a question about tax reform. "
"2017-05-03",-3,"Suppliers rely on strong iPhone sales for part of their profits, and in some cases Apple’s announcement on Tuesday reawakened concerns about excessive exposure to Apple. Shares in Dialog Semiconductor, which provides power management systems for Apple, fell 3 percent, among the top European fallers on the day. The company has been in investors’ focus since mid-April when a research note from German broker Bankhaus Lampe suggested Apple could be developing the capacity to bring its power management components in-house. That report knocked as much as a quarter off of Dialog’s market value on the day. The company gets nearly 75 percent of its revenue from Apple, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. Imagination Technologies, a British designer of graphical processing units used in smartphones, was down 0.5 percent. In April it said Apple, its largest customer, would stop using its technology within 15 to 24 months, causing its stock to lose nearly two thirds of its value in a single day. Swiss company AMS, the maker of optical sensors for iPhones, dropped 2.1 percent and Italy’s STMicro, which provides the phone’s accelerometers, gyroscopes and motion sensors, fell 1.7 percent. Shares in ASML, Europe’s largest supplier to computer chip makers, fell 0.6 percent. The Netherlands-listed company is lower down the Apple supply chain than Dialog and STMicro, supplying to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company which in turn serves Apple. Apple said on Tuesday it sold 50.76 million iPhones in the quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of its 10th anniversary edition.. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. (Reporting by Helen Reid, Editing by Vikram Subhedar and Susan Thomas)"
"2017-09-13",-2,"The delay in shipping of the iPhone X could hurt Apple’s seasonally-strong fiscal first quarter as orders get pushed to the following quarter. The phone will start at $999 for the 64 GB version. Apple’s shares were down 1 percent at $159.35 in early trading on Wednesday. Although decked out with facial recognition technology, front and back glass, a 5.8-inch edge to edge display, wireless charging and animated emojis, some analysts said the delay tempers near-term sales and a few adjusted their estimates. “Given one month less sales for the iPhone X during the December quarter, we have reduced our December quarter iPhone sales estimates from 84 million to 79 million units,” Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a client note. The company’s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus did not veer far away from previous models, sporting modest new features such as a glass body, wireless charging, better camera and a faster processor. This could lead consumers to wait for the iPhone X. “None of the features in the version 8 product will likely accelerate demand,” Mizuho analysts wrote in a note. Apple typically launches new iPhones in September and a big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, as users tend to upgrade devices when new phones sport significant design changes. Apple last saw a significant uptick in sales with the introduction of iPhone 6 in 2015. While the delay of the iPhone X could hurt near-term sales, analysts still think Apple’s loyal and hungry fans would lap up the new phone, boosting sales for fiscal 2018. Brokerage UBS said it continues to estimate 246 million phones in fiscal 2018 – up 15 percent. Apple, which is trying to energize sales in China, could hit a wall selling the pricey new phones there. The 8 and 8 plus start at $699 and the iPhone X is Apple’s most expensive phone. The high price of the iPhone X may not affect sales in the United States, where telecom carriers subsidize phone ownership, but it might dent sales in China and India. But even with the lack of major surprises, Apple’s phones are still expected to sell well. “It will still sell in enormous volumes because Apple has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to persuade consumers to shift their overall spending to place a greater share of their disposable income toward a smartphone purchase,” IHS Markit analyst wrote in a note.

"2017-08-08",-11,"Qualcomm filed the complaint in early July, asking U.S. trade regulators to ban certain models of the iPhone that contain so-called broadband modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, that were not made by Qualcomm. Apple began using broadband modem chips made by Intel Corp in the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but says the way Apple uses them in the iPhone does. ”We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. Intel declined to comment. Apple pointed to Chief Executive  Tim Cook’s earlier comments that Qualcomm had not yet offered it “fair and reasonable” licensing terms for Qualcomm’s technology. ”I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,“ Cook told investors in May on the company’s earnings call, his most recent public comment on the topic. ”I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” As the ITC considered whether to take up the case, a group representing Alphabet Inc’s  Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc sided last month with Apple, saying Qualcomm’s request to bar the import of some iPhones would hurt consumers. In turn, Qualcomm accused the group of “a coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting” the trade regulators. It said Apple was free to choose chips from a variety of vendors without necessarily infringing Qualcomm’s patents. The fight before trade regulators in Washington is one of several major legal battles involving Qualcomm and Apple. The two companies have cases pending before separate federal courts in California, and Qualcomm also faces a complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Analysts are watching the ITC case closely because the trade regulator moves more quickly than many courts and could deliver a decision ahead of the pending lawsuits. "
"2017-07-10",2,"Apple has pledged to back the Paris climate accord by switching to renewable energy and has recently issued a $1 billion green bond after the United States pulled out of the pact. Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. Apple said the data center would begin operations in the second quarter of 2019 in Aabenraa in southern Denmark near the German border. It will power Apple’s online services, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri for customers across Europe. “We’re thrilled to be expanding our data center operations in Denmark, and investing in new sources of clean power,” Erik Stannow, Nordic manager for Apple, said in a statement emailed to Reuters. “The planned facility in Aabenraa, like all of our data centers, will run on 100 percent renewable energy from day one, thanks to new clean energy sources we’re adding,” he said. Apple’s first data center in Denmark near the town of Viborg is due to begin operations later this year. Apple said a planned data center in Athenry, Ireland, announced in 2015 had yet to begin construction. Apple confirmed that the Irish data center is currently under judicial review. Denmark, a leader in wind power, has abundant supplies of wind energy as well biomass energy. “The reliability of the Danish grid is one of the main reasons we will operate two sites in Denmark,” Stannow said. The small Nordic country hopes these investments will boost its IT sector. “Denmark is becoming northern Europe’s hub for data centers with a high prospective for growth for the tracking industries delivering solutions to the many data centres sprouting up all over the world,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

"2017-11-21",1,"Both Apple and Dublin are appealing the original ruling, saying the iPhone maker’s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. “We’ve indicated to them (Apple) that we want the escrow account established and we want funds to be paid into the escrow account without further delay,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told parliament. “We do not want to be in the situation where the Irish government has to take Apple to court because the European Commission is taking the Irish government to court. I think that message is understood and I’d anticipate progress in the coming weeks.” The Commission said last month the deadline for Ireland to implement its decision had been Jan. 3 this year and that, until the aid was recovered, the company continued to benefit from an illegal advantage. Ireland, which described the Commission’s move to take it to court as “extremely regrettable,” said it had been in constant contact with the Commission and Apple for more than a year and was close to setting up an escrow account to hold the funds.  Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe also said at the time that, in addition to work on the escrow account, the government was in “commercially sensitive” talks with Apple about the exact terms of the transfer.

"2017-10-19",-1,"The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X. But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.   Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released. “I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call. “As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”  The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.  “The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.  “iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”  When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X. But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone  marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.  A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week. But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.  “They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.  There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.  Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device. "
"2017-06-06",-2,"Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them - and buy more toilet paper, too. Viewers want to watch their favorite programs on whatever device they choose. Yet Monday’s announcement, rather than being routine, was the result of a negotiation stretching back at least to 2015 when Amazon stopped selling Apple TVs on its retail site. Amazon had explained that move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who would expect Prime Video to be on devices sold by Amazon. Critics instead saw a negotiating tactic to get Prime Video onto the Apple device, and a prod for people to buy Amazon’s competing Fire TV players. “Whenever these companies try to freeze each other out, the consumer always loses,” said Paul Verna, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Amazon and Apple declined to comment on how their differences have affected customers. The companies said Amazon shows will be available on Apple TV later this year, but did not specify a date. Streaming is not the only example where a spat between Apple and Amazon limited customer choice. Amazon’s popular voice-controlled speaker, the Echo, can be told to play songs from an Amazon music account or even Spotify, but not from Apple Music. Amazon’s Kindle app for Apple’s iPhone lets people read but not buy books, which must be purchased directly from Amazon’s website. According to former Amazon employees, the company at times brings in tangential business concerns as leverage in negotiations. “The outcomes of these deals may factor into future conversations,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. It was not clear how Amazon and Apple came to terms on the video player. Analysts estimate that the ascendance of Prime Video gave Amazon a better starting point for negotiations. Its shows and films have started winning awards, including three Oscars in 2017. The internet video player with most market share, Roku, not only offers Prime Video but has a smaller price tag than Apple TV.  “It put Apple TV at a big disadvantage,” said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV[R]EV. Amazon declined to comment on whether it will again sell Apple TVs. "
"2017-07-29",-4,"VPNs allow users to bypass China’s so-called “Great Firewall” aimed at restricting access to overseas sites. Beijing has shut down dozens of China-based providers and it has been targeting overseas services as it bids to tighten its control over the internet, especially ahead of the Communist Party congress in August. VPN provider ExpressVPN said on Saturday that it had received a notice from Apple that its software would be removed from the China App Store “because it includes content that is illegal in China”. “We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts,” ExpressVPN said in a statement. Another provider, StarVPN, said via its Twitter account on Saturday that it had also received the notice from Apple. Apple declined to comment on the issue when contacted by Reuters on Saturday. China users with billing addresses in other countries will still be able to access VPN apps from other branches of the App Store. A number of VPN apps were still accessible on the China App store on Saturday. Apple is in the middle of a localisation drive in China, and named a new managing director for the region - a new role - this month.

"2017-07-18",2,"“Apple is strongly committed to invest and grow in China,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in the statement. “We look forward to making even greater contributions under her leadership.” The announcement comes as Apple works to meet compliance measures under a new law requiring foreign firms to store data locally in partnership with Chinese entities. Apple last week said it will invest in a $1 billion project in Guizhou province which will include a data center run with a local partner. It said none of its systems will have so-called backdoors that allow outside parties to access data. Ge Mahe’s previous projects include working with China’s state-backed telecom firms to develop country-specific functions including the ability to use local telephone numbers as Apple identification numbers, short message service (SMS) fraud detection, and support for quick response (QR) codes which are widely used in China for payments.  “I am looking forward to deepening our team’s connections with customers, government and businesses in China to advance innovation and sustainability,” said Ge Mahe in the statement. In the new role she will report directly to Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jim Williams, the company said. "

There is one “strong sell” rating on the stock and the remainder are “buy” or higher. The median price target of $160 is up from $145 three months ago.   Apple shares were down 3.6 percent to $143.59, the biggest drag on each of the three major Wall Street indexes.

He said he did not charge the new device and returned it to the seller. An Apple spokesperson said the company is looking into the matter and declined to comment further. The incident comes as indifferent reviews of the iPhone 8, which comes 10 years after Apple released the first version of the revolutionary phone, drove down shares of the company since the handset’s launch. Some investors worry whether pre-orders for the device were well below previous launches, although some Apple fans are waiting for the premium iPhone X due out in early November.

There was no sign of scorching or an explosion. Liu told ThePaper he bought the handset through online marketplace of JD.com Inc (JD.O). He said he did not charge the new device and returned it to the seller. An Apple spokesperson said the company is looking into the matter and declined to comment further. The incident comes as indifferent reviews of the iPhone 8, which comes 10 years after Apple released the first version of the revolutionary phone, drove down shares of the company since the handset’s launch. Some investors worry whether pre-orders for the device were well below previous launches, although some Apple fans are waiting for the premium iPhone X due out in early November.

"2017-08-08",-11,"Qualcomm filed the complaint in early July, asking U.S. trade regulators to ban certain models of the iPhone that contain so-called broadband modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, that were not made by Qualcomm. Apple began using broadband modem chips made by Intel Corp in the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but says the way Apple uses them in the iPhone does. ”We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. Intel declined to comment. Apple pointed to Chief Executive  Tim Cook’s earlier comments that Qualcomm had not yet offered it “fair and reasonable” licensing terms for Qualcomm’s technology. ”I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,“ Cook told investors in May on the company’s earnings call, his most recent public comment on the topic. ”I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” As the ITC considered whether to take up the case, a group representing Alphabet Inc’s  Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc sided last month with Apple, saying Qualcomm’s request to bar the import of some iPhones would hurt consumers. In turn, Qualcomm accused the group of “a coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting” the trade regulators. It said Apple was free to choose chips from a variety of vendors without necessarily infringing Qualcomm’s patents. The fight before trade regulators in Washington is one of several major legal battles involving Qualcomm and Apple. The two companies have cases pending before separate federal courts in California, and Qualcomm also faces a complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Analysts are watching the ITC case closely because the trade regulator moves more quickly than many courts and could deliver a decision ahead of the pending lawsuits. "
"2017-09-20",-5,"The Watch Series 3 starts at $399 and was launched alongside new iPhone models. Unlike previous versions of the watch, it has cellular network connectivity built in. Apple said the watch can experience LTE connectivity problems when it connects to open wi-fi networks such as at a hotel or a coffee shop. The company is “investigating a fix for a future software release,” Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette told Reuters. Many reviewers such as the New York Times praised the new features and gave generally positive assessments. But other prominent publications, including the Wall Street Journal and The Verge, recommended against purchasing the new model because the LTE cellular data connectivity did not work as expected.  ""Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn't function like it was supposed to, I can't recommend buying it — and paying the monthly cell fee — based on promises,"" Verge reviewer Lauren Goode wrote. (bit.ly/2fj8Jiy) Apart from connection issues, some reviewers were disappointed with the drain on the watch’s battery while making calls. Apple had touted up to 18 hours of battery life but said the watch would get only one hour on a cellular phone call.  Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst with Loup Ventures, doubted issues with the Series 3 Watch would hurt Apple’s bottom line. “That review takeaway is a negative but is not a surprise. This is the first generation watch with LTE,” he told Reuters. Bob O‘Donnell, an analyst with Techanlysis Research, said the watch reviews, paired with reviews of the iPhone 8 that were generally positive but described the phone as an incremental improvement on its predecessor, put more pressure on the iPhone X to garner good press before its Nov. 3 launch. Apple also experienced hiccups with iOS 11, the new operating system the firm released Tuesday. For business users, iOS 11’s Mail application had problems sending mail for Microsoft Exchange and Outlook.com mail accounts. (The story fixes typographical error in paragraph 1) "

The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), Electronic Arts (EA.O) and Take Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria - strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent.

"2017-09-13",-4,"The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in “Dick Tracy,” the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys.  “This has been our vision from the beginning,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event.  “Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected. It’s really nice to know you can be reached if needed.” To be sure, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014, but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power. They also require a separate phone number.  Apple claims its new Series 3, on the other hand, will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2. And it will have the same phone number as a customer’s iPhone, which will still be required for the initial set up of the watch. Apple said that all four major U.S. carriers will offer service for the watch, and AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra $10 a month. At $399, the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model, the $329 Series 2, which introduced standalone GPS capability. That $70 extra buys much more useful capabilities - including the ability to stream music from Apple Music.  “The third time is the charm for the watch,” said Bob O‘Donnell of Techanalysis Research. Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018. Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump, to 26 million units in 2018. Either way, Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals such as Fitbit Inc and Garmin Ltd, which would be hard-pressed from a technical and business standpoint  to match Apple’s wireless features.  But the new Apple Watch still requires an iPhone, which Fitbit believes leaves it ample market room to sell wearable devices that work with all phones, not just iPhones. “With Android comprising approximately 80 percent of the global smartphone market, broad compatibility remains a core differentiator for Fitbit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. Garmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours. The Watch will remain a blip in Apple’s sales, which were $215 billion last year. But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without - all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses. "
"2017-10-23",-8,"U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California issued an order late on Sunday, 10 months after the U.S. Supreme Court set aside a $399 million award against Samsung for mimicking the iPhone’s look for its Galaxy and other devices. The Supreme Court said damages could be based only on parts of a device that may have infringed patents, not necessarily the entire device. Koh said the jury instructions at the Apple-Samsung trial “did not accurately reflect the law” and may have prejudiced Samsung by preventing jurors from considering whether any infringement covered “something other than the entire phone.” The $399 million is part of a $548 million payment that Samsung made to Apple in December 2015. Apple had argued that no new trial was warranted, and that the $399 million award should be confirmed. It did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Samsung, in a statement, said it welcomed Koh’s order. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bill Rigby)"
"2017-04-22",-1,"The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company’s highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet’s Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform.   Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called “Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview” whose objective is “to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.” “Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,” the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple’s development platform “will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.” The document does not include detail on how Apple’s self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple’s three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer’s cars. "
"2017-07-29",-6,"In January, Beijing passed laws seeking to ban all VPNs that are not approved by state regulators. Approved VPNs must use state network infrastructure. In a statement on Sunday, an Apple spokeswoman confirmed it will remove apps that don’t comply with the law from its China App Store, including services based outside the country. Beijing has shut down dozens of China-based providers and it has been targeting overseas services as it bids to tighten its control over the internet, especially ahead of the Communist Party congress in August.     While personal VPN providers have been the subject of state-led attacks in the past, this marks the first time Apple has complied with requests to scrub overseas providers from its store, a move that VPN providers say is unnecessarily supportive of China’s heightened censorship regime.  VPN provider ExpressVPN said on Saturday that it had received a notice from Apple that its software would be removed from the China App Store “because it includes content that is illegal in China”. “We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts,” ExpressVPN said in a statement. Other major providers, including VyprVPN and StarVPN, confirmed they also received the notice on Saturday from Apple. “We view access to Internet in China as a human rights issue and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profit,” Sunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, which oversees VyprVPN told Reuters on Sunday.  Yokubaitis said Golden Frog will file an appeal to Apple over the ban. China users with billing addresses in other countries will still be able to access VPN apps from other branches of the App Store. A number of VPN apps were still accessible on the China App store on Saturday.    Apple is in the middle of a localization drive in China, and named a new managing director for the region - a new role - this month.  It is also establishing a data center with a local partner in the southwestern province of Guizhou to comply with new Chinese cloud storage regulations. VPN providers say that while the apps are not available on the store, users are still able to manually install them using VPN support built into Apple’s operating system. “We are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure,” said Yokubaitis. “(It’s been a) disappointing morning but we will fight on.” "
"2017-08-15",-2,"The deal comes as the Maple bond market, which had previously been dominated by foreign banks, attracts more issuance from companies. AB InBev did a C$2 billion two-tranche deal in May, according to Thomson Reuters IFR. The pricing compares with unofficial guidance which had been set in the area of 83 basis points over the curve plus or minus 3 basis points. Apple’s size and brand name allows the company to borrow cheaply, said Altaf Nanji, head of corporate research at Manulife Asset Management. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Apple said the proceeds of the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the size or price of the deal. Despite the size of the deal, investors said it will not erode the capacity of the market to absorb bonds from other issuers after a period of slower issuance throughout the summer.  ”The deal may have taken out some near-term liquidity but it doesn’t mean that there won’t be room for other issuers as well, said Darcy Briggs, a fixed-income portfolio manager with the Bissett unit of Franklin Templeton Investments.

"2017-11-03",7,"Apple’s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world’s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.  “I can’t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,” said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block. Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.  “I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”  The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States. The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone. Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.  In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district. “I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night. In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7. In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.  “I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue. In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.   Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased. But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing. “Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said. Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks. The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.  Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion. Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles. “We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.

"2017-06-09",0,"Hollywood has been awaiting the entry of deep-pocketed Apple into original TV series, a field crowded with award-winning dramas and comedies from outlets such as Netflix and Time Warner Inc’s HBO.    The first “Apps” episode will be free to anyone who wants to see it on iTunes and the show’s website. Subsequent episodes will be released each Tuesday on Apple Music and available only to the streaming service’s subscribers.     On the show, developers try to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The advisers help contestants build their products and prepare appeals for funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, the first investor in Snapchat.     “The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview. “Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what’s involved. This really shows how that’s possible.”    “Planet of the Apps” came from musician will.i.am, who with producer Ben Silverman had shopped the series to traditional TV players before approaching Apple. Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses.    “I felt like this was a great way to show that app developers or business people are not just white dudes in suits, or white dudes coding,” Alba said.    In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept. Another developer feels overwhelmed by will.i.am’s rapid-fire list of ideas.     At the show’s end, viewers are told they can download the apps from Apple’s App Store. The show itself will be promoted on the Apple.com home page, on iTunes and elsewhere.    “All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another,” Cue said. "

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland. “We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said. According to the August 2016 decision issued by the EU, Apple met with the European Commission in 2015 to explain its new corporate structure as well as submitting a summary with the key elements as a follow-up. Vestager also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any general investigations. “That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.” The Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple. “We have no indication when it comes to the time perspective of Apple’s recovery. We do have from the Irish government the progress made,” she said. ($1 = 0.8649 euros) "
"2017-05-18",-20,"Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in rebates - a move that came days after the U.S. government accused the chipmaker of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm has called Apple’s suit baseless and has said the iPhone maker was encouraging regulatory attacks on its business. On Wednesday, Qualcomm said in its complaint that Apple had advised the four contract manufacturers to withhold royalty payments and agreed to indemnify them against any damages resulting from the breach of their agreements with Qualcomm. It did not disclose the sum of the alleged unpaid royalties in the complaint which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm is seeking an order for the suppliers to comply with contractual obligations as well as damages. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and one of Apple’s main suppliers, said it had not yet received documents regarding the lawsuit and declined further comment. Wistron Corp also said it had not received the relevant documents. Pegatron Corp declined to comment, while Compal Electronics Inc did not offer immediate comment. Last month, Qualcomm slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, saying it excluded revenue receivable from the four contract manufacturers. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, said in its filing that Apple is trying to force the company to agree to an “unreasonable demand for a below-market direct license”. Apple reiterated that it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but the company has refused to negotiate fair terms. Qualcomm’s shares fell 1 percent to $55.36 on Wednesday while Apple’s shares slid 3.4 percent to $150.25. Shares in the Taiwanese suppliers fell between 0.4 percent and 2 percent in early Thursday trade except for Compal which rose 1.5 percent. "

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country. Apple did not respond to an e-mail query asking about whether it was committed to the project.  A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple in July announced it would build its second EU data center there.

"2017-11-22",-9,"“We discovered instances of student interns working overtime at a supplier facility in China. We’ve confirmed the students worked voluntarily, were compensated and provided benefits, but they should not have been allowed to work overtime,” Apple said in a statement. Apple and Foxconn have been accused of poor labor practices in the past, but the U.S. technology giant has been trying to get a grip of such issues, releasing annual reviews of the iPhone supply chain. The violations announced this week come as the company is stretching to meet demand for its new iPhone X, which began shipping this month. The FT report said the students, aged between 17-19, were being forced by their school to participate in the internship.  “Our policies do not allow interns to work more than 40 hours per week on program-related assignments. Unfortunately, there have been a number of cases where portions of our campuses have not adhered to this policy,” Foxconn said in a statement, adding that the interns accounted for a small part of the workforce.   Apple’s statement said that the company had sent staff to the site to address the violations. Labor rights groups have previously criticized Apple and Foxconn for excessive overtime, hiring underage workers and failing to provide health insurance.  Since 2012 Apple says it has reduced the number of underage workers in its extended supply chain, which includes locations where rare earth minerals are mined for use in the smartphones. "

"2017-09-28",-2,"The requests come in the form of so-called National Security Letters, or NSLs, and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple and other companies report ranges because government rules prevent disclosing precise numbers. Apple declined to comment beyond the figures it released.  The disclosures are voluntary, and firms like Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have yet to report any figures for 2017. In the past, those companies have issued more detailed reports, for example separating FISA requests and NSLs. The government requires they wait six months to report that level of information. Alphabet Inc's Google said it had received between 0 and 499 National Security Letters requesting information on between 1,000 and 1,499 user accounts in the first half of 2017. A year previously, the number of requests was the same but the government asked about only 500 to 999 accounts, according to Google's transparency report. Its 2017 FISA request numbers were not yet available. (bit.ly/2k8lDBL) It was not immediately clear what drove the increase in requests to Apple. But Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that the number of government requests to technology companies has been increasing since 2014, when data first started to become available as part of a settlement between technology firms and the government.  “There’s not a huge track record here, but you can start to make a simple graph. The trend does seem to be upward,” Crocker said. Crocker also said the higher requests to Apple could represent it coming in line with its peers. Despite Apple’s huge user base - it has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones - the number of requests to it had been relatively low compared with firms like Google or Microsoft. National security letters are a type of government subpoena for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant."

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones. Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999. He noted that Sprint Corp’s  iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.  However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright. If customers order the phone on an installment billing plan, they will pay the same price charged by Apple and the carriers. “Our prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer’s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy,” Best Buy spokeswoman Carly Charlson said.  “Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.” "

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and one of Apple’s main suppliers, said it had not yet received documents regarding the lawsuit and declined further comment. Last month, Qualcomm slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, saying it excluded revenue receivable from the four contract manufacturers.  Apple reiterated that it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but the company has refused to negotiate fair terms. Qualcomm’s shares fell 1 percent to $55.36 on Wednesday  while Apple’s shares slid 3.4 percent to $150.25. Shares in the Taiwanese suppliers fell between 0.4 percent and 2 percent in early Thursday trade except for Compal which rose 1.5 percent. "

It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. “Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it’s been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors.” Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 percent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 percent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor’s data.

"2017-04-24",-1,"A premiere party for “Carpool Karaoke” scheduled for March in Los Angeles was postponed without explanation days before it was to take place. This week, the company again postponed its launch party, which had been rescheduled for Monday.   Apple, a company known for its precisely coordinated product launches, declined to explain the delays, but said in a statement that “Carpool Karaoke: The Series will premiere on Apple Music later this year.”  The series is an adaptation of a segment than runs during CBS’ “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and sees him driving with a celebrity and singing a medley of songs.  A representative for CBS Television Studios said in an email on Monday: “We’re excited about our ‘Carpool Karaoke’ for Apple Music, and look forward to everyone seeing it later this year.” Launched in mid-2015, Apple Music has struggled to gain traction. The company said that the service, which sells for $9.99 a month and is heavily promoted to iPhone users, had 20 million subscribers at the end of 2016.  Rival streaming platform Spotify, which offers both a free version and a $9.99 monthly subscription, said in March it had 50 million subscribers. Apple Music has primarily offered streaming music to its subscribers, but hoped additional exclusive video content would lure new customers.  Apple has said that each of the 16 half-hour episodes it is planning of “Carpool Karaoke” would pair two celebrities spending the day driving around together. Apple Music has also announced plans for a reality show, “Planet of the Apps,” which Cue said was due this spring. "
"2017-08-29",0,"Analysts expected the game to make $3 billion for Apple over two years as gamers buy “PokéCoins” from its app store.  Google’s take on the technology will first be available on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google’s own Pixel phone. The company said in a blog post that it hoped to make the system, called ARCore, available to at least 100 million users, but did not set a date for a broad release. Apple in June announced a similar system called ARKit that it plans to release this fall on “hundreds of millions” of devices.  Google and Apple will jockey for the attention of customers and software developers who will build the games, walking guides and other applications that would make AR a compelling feature. Many tech industry leaders envision a future in which eyeglasses, car windshields and other surfaces can overlay digital information on the real world. Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have already experimented with AR glasses. “AR is big and profound,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors earlier in August. “And this is one of those huge things that we’ll look back at and marvel on the start of it.” Apple and Google have had to make compromises to bring the technology to market. In Apple’s case, the Cupertino, California-based company decided to make its AR system work with devices capable of running iOS 11, its next-generation operating system due out this fall. This means it will work on phones going back to the iPhone 6s, which have a single camera at the back and standard motion sensors, rather than a dual camera system found on newer models such as the iPhone 7 Plus or special depth-sensing chips in competing phones. That limits the range of images that can be displayed. Google initially aimed to solve this problem with an AR system called Tango that uses a special depth-sensor, but only two phone makers so far support it. With ARCore, Google changed course to work on phones without depth sensors. But the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem presents challenges. To spread its AR system beyond the Galaxy S8 and Pixel phone, Google will have to figure out how account for the wide variety of Android phone cameras or require phone makers to use specific parts. Apple, however, is able to make its system work well because it knows exactly which hardware and software are on the iPhone and calibrates them tightly. Michael Valdsgaard, a developer with the furniture chain IKEA, called the system “rock solid,” noting that it could estimate the size of virtual furniture placed in a room with 98 percent accuracy, despite lacking special sensors.  “This is a classic example of where Apple’s ownership of the whole widget including both hardware and software is a huge advantage over device vendors dependent on Android and the broader value chain of component vendors,” said Jan Dawson, founder and chief analyst of Jackdaw Research. "
"2017-04-14",-3,"Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan.  “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler.  The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said.    An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.  Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N). Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.

"2017-06-22",-3,"Apple’s decision, which analysts said posed an existential threat to the company, sent Imagination’s shares plummeting 70 percent on April 3 and they have barely recovered since. The stock jumped as much as 21 percent on Thursday, however, after the sale announcement to 149.5 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of 425 million pounds ($538 million).  Analysts said potential buyers could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various entities from China, while Apple itself could be interested. “Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group,” the company said.  “The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.” Imagination has said it doubted Apple, which accounts for about half of its sales, could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents. Analysts said legal battles were likely and Imagination started a dispute resolution procedure in May with the U.S. giant, which is valued at $761 billion. The British company initially responded to Apple’s decision to walk away by putting two of its main divisions up for sale. “That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer,” said Neil Wilson, Senior Market Analyst, ETX Capital. “Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.” Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed, prompting Apple and Intel to buy stakes and the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012. Apple owns 8 percent of the shares. Imagination struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Analysts at Stifel said they thought interested parties could include those groups that want to develop their own processing technology across platforms such as mobile, wearable tech, vehicles and the so-called Internet of Things. “This could include a coordinated Chinese bid, a hyper-scale vendor from the cloud or some other IP player,” they said.  Imagination said on Thursday it had received indicative proposals for its embedded MIPS technology - processors used in vehicles and home appliances - and its mobile connectivity division Ensigma, the two businesses put up for sale in the wake of the slide in its shares. While Imagination has other clients for its technology, UBS analysts estimated in April that its non-Apple business was worth just 81 million pounds and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013, was worth 77 million pounds. UBS said the company could be worth 110 pence per share on a sum of the parts basis. In May, Jefferies said the wind up value was about 96 pence a share while Morgan Stanley said the company could be worth as little as 106 million pounds, or just 30 pence per share, though its base case was 95 pence. The U.S. investment bank said Imagination’s headquarters was worth 40 million pounds. "
"2017-09-06",3,"Amazon and Apple are willing to pay about the same amount for the rights as Warner Bros, the magazine said, citing anonymous sources. It did not give a figure. The Bond franchise is worth between $2 billion and $5 billion, an industry insider, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Hollywood Reporter.  Apple and Amazon were not immediately available for comment. Sony previously owned the distribution rights, but they expired with the 2015 release of the latest Bond film, “Spectre.” That movie took in about $880 million at the global box office, according to film tracker BoxOfficeMojo.com. James Bond, created by British author Ian Fleming, first burst onto the silver screen in 1962 in the hit “Dr. No,” starring Sean Connery as the British secret agent. A plethora of Bond films followed, starring Connery and several actors who succeeded him in the role, including Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Bond has most recently been played by Daniel Craig. Amazon has been spending billions of dollars to create and license TV shows and films. Earlier this year, company unit Amazon Studios scored a best-actor Oscar for Casey Affleck’s portrayal of a grieving man in the movie “Manchester by the Sea.” The movie also won an Academy Award for best original screenplay.

"2017-04-11",-5,"Bankhaus Lampe cut its rating on Dialog to “sell” from “hold” as it argued in a research note that Apple was working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone that could replace Dialog’s power management integrated circuits (PMIC) as early as 2019. Apple accounted for more than 70 percent of Dialog’s 2016 sales, the broker estimated. Shares in Dialog fell as much as 36 percent to a seven-month low. By 0831 GMT they were trading down 23.7 percent at 36.39 euros. Bankhaus Lampe cited unnamed industry sources as saying that Apple is setting up power management design centres both in Munich and California and added that Apple already has around 80 engineers working on a power management chip of its own. “In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen advised investors. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Apple was recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich. “They are poaching like crazy,” the person said. A Dialog spokesman declined to comment. He added that the company is not planning to release any official statement. The downgrade comes after Imagination Technologies was advised by Apple that it planned to replace Imagination’s graphics chip designs in upcoming products, sending shudders through Apple’s global component supply chain. Imagination shares plunged 70 percent on the news last week . Iltgen is a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Dialog and ranks sixth among 16 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. Dialog has made several failed attempts to diversify beyond Apple and other smartphone customers in recent years. In 2014, merger talks between Dialog and Austrian sensor chip maker Ams AG fell apart after they failed to come to terms.

"2017-05-03",-4,"By Helen Reid LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Shares of European suppliers of microchips, sensors and circuitry to Apple fell on Wednesday after the smartphone company’s much-awaited iPhone sales missed expectations in the second quarter. Suppliers rely on strong iPhone sales for part of their profits, and in some cases Apple’s announcement on Tuesday reawakened concerns about excessive exposure to Apple. Shares in Dialog Semiconductor, which provides power management systems for Apple, fell 3 percent, among the top European fallers on the day. The company has been in investors’ focus since mid-April when a research note from German broker Bankhaus Lampe suggested Apple could be developing the capacity to bring its power management components in-house. That report knocked as much as a quarter off of Dialog’s market value on the day. The company gets nearly 75 percent of its revenue from Apple, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. Imagination Technologies, a British designer of graphical processing units used in smartphones, was down 0.5 percent. In April it said Apple, its largest customer, would stop using its technology within 15 to 24 months, causing its stock to lose nearly two thirds of its value in a single day. Swiss company AMS, the maker of optical sensors for iPhones, dropped 2.1 percent and Italy’s STMicro, which provides the phone’s accelerometers, gyroscopes and motion sensors, fell 1.7 percent. Shares in ASML, Europe’s largest supplier to computer chip makers, fell 0.6 percent. The Netherlands-listed company is lower down the Apple supply chain than Dialog and STMicro, supplying to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company which in turn serves Apple. Apple said on Tuesday it sold 50.76 million iPhones in the quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of its 10th anniversary edition..

"2017-08-02",-3,"Apple also said it hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold.  The April-June quarter is traditionally a soft one for Apple as the market waits for the September launch of new iPhone models. But Tuesday’s results show that iPhone buyers may be less inclined than they once were to delay purchases until a new model is out.  The iPad product lines also showed unexpected strength, service revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, and even the much-maligned Apple Watch showed a 50 percent sales increase. Apple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag. The phone is expected to launch in September. The company forecast total revenue of between $49 billion and $52 billion for the current fourth quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $49.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple’s fourth quarter generally includes first-weekend sales of the company’s latest devices. The forecast “makes it fairly certain that at least some new iPhone models will be released on the normal schedule,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “That doesn’t necessarily mean all new models will go on sale then, or that they’ll all be in abundant supply, but I would think it means that at the very least the successors to the current phones will be available.” But Bob O‘Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple releases cheaper models before the premium models in its 10th anniversary phone lineup, the cheaper models could dampen sales of more expensive units released closer to the holidays. The company said iPhone sales rose 1.6 percent to 41.03 million in the third quarter ended July 1, above analysts’ average estimate of 40.7 million units, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones a year earlier. But a lower average iPhone selling price of $606, well below Wall Street expectations of $621, caused iPhone revenue to come in at $24.8 billion, below expectations of $25.5 billion. Apple reports how many phones it sells to retailers, not how many phones it sells to consumers, what is known as a sell-in basis. When factoring how many existing “high end” phones the company cleared out of retail inventory, Maestri said average selling prices were higher. The company’s net income rose to $8.72 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $7.80 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $45.41 billion from $42.36 billion in the quarter, typically the company’s weakest, beating expectations of $44.89 billion. The decline was smaller than recent quarters. Apple’s Maestri said mainland China revenue was flat, as were iPhone sales in the mainland. Sales of other Apple products rose in mainland China and were also up in Taiwan. “The decline from a market standpoint was concentrated in Hong Kong, which is a place that has been really affected by a reduction in tourism because the Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,” Maestri said. Apple CEO Tim Cook also directly addressed the company’s decision to remove so-called VPN apps from the App Store in China. Those apps help Chinese users circumnavigate government internet restrictions. “We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business,” Cook said. “We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. This particular case, we’re hopeful that over time the restrictions we’re seeing are lessened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate.” Strong iPad sales of $4.9 billion - almost $1 billion above Wall Street expectations - and a 21.6 percent jump in the company’s services business that includes the App Store also helped boost revenue. In particular, Apple said that Walmart Stores Inc would buy 19,000 iPads to train as many as 225,000 employees. The company also said it increased production of AirPods, its wireless headphones.  Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to directly address U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims that Apple will build three new factories in the U.S., instead citing the company’s job creation efforts and a $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund. Cook also hinted that Apple’s experiments with self-driving cars may include ambitions that extend beyond cars. He said the company is making a “big investment” in autonomous systems. “From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects,” Cook said. “And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don’t want to go any further with that.” "
"2017-06-02",2,"Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment.  But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino‘s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers.  Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.”  The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” "

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The group listed 131 organizations from numerous countries as supportive of the Oct. 10 complaint to Apple, among them groups working on human rights, youth and drug policy reform. They urged Apple to issue an apology for hosting such “insensitive content”. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in Duterte’s 15-month-old war on drugs, a campaign that has caused international alarm. Human rights groups say state-sponsored executions are taking place, an assertion the authorities vehemently reject. The group said games such as “Fighting Crime 2”, “Duterte knows Kung Fu”, “Duterte Running Man Challenge”, “Tsip Bato” and “Duterte Vs Zombies” “might seem harmless and fun” but were offensive and distasteful because in reality, murder and impunity had prevailed. “Duterte Running Man Challenge” was not available for download on Friday, and three of the app developers could not be reached for comment. Ben Joseph Banta, a managing partner of Ranida Games, which developed “Tsip Bato”, said the game sought to discourage drug use with the use of banner messages opposing drugs that were visible to players. “The aim of our game is not to promote violence,” Banta said in an emailed response, adding that it featured “supplemental digital content against the use of illegal drugs.”  “We understand the human rights groups and we’re very much open to make changes in the game in order to remove the stigma that the game is promoting violence,” he said.

"2017-05-23",-4,"The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia’s digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France’s Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. “There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel,” said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an “accumulate” recommendation for Nokia shares. “I have not given any value so far for Nokia’s digital health business, but might apply an option value to it.” “(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centres,” he said. “It’s a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it.” Under the patent licence agreement, Nokia will receive a “significant” upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. “It’s interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure,” said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT. A previous patent licence contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. “(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners,” Nokia’s Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. “Nokia told analysts in April don’t calculate on any licence revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia’s legal expenses,” said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. “For Nokia, it’s good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact,” said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. “The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros.” Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company’s patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents.

"2017-09-29",-2,"The requests come in the form of so-called National Security Letters, or NSLs, and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple and other companies report ranges because government rules prevent disclosing precise numbers. Apple declined to comment beyond the figures it released.  The disclosures are voluntary, and firms like Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have yet to report any figures for 2017. In the past, those companies have issued more detailed reports, for example separating FISA requests and NSLs. The government requires they wait six months to report that level of information. Alphabet Inc's Google said it had received between 0 and 499 National Security Letters requesting information on between 1,000 and 1,499 user accounts in the first half of 2017. A year previously, the number of requests was the same but the government asked about only 500 to 999 accounts, according to Google's transparency report. Its 2017 FISA request numbers were not yet available. (bit.ly/2k8lDBL) It was not immediately clear what drove the increase in requests to Apple. But Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that the number of government requests to technology companies has been increasing since 2014, when data first started to become available as part of a settlement between technology firms and the government.  “There’s not a huge track record here, but you can start to make a simple graph. The trend does seem to be upward,” Crocker said. Crocker also said the higher requests to Apple could represent it coming in line with its peers. Despite Apple’s huge user base - it has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones - the number of requests to it had been relatively low compared with firms like Google or Microsoft. National security letters are a type of government subpoena for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant."
"2017-11-02",3,"The Sydney store opened its doors shortly after Apple released its fourth quarter results that showed forecast revenue for the holiday shopping-quarter largely above market expectations. Shares in the company rose 3 percent in after-hours to a new all-time high as investor concerns about production delays for the new phone were allayed. Around 400 people lined up outside Apple’s flagship Sydney branch to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the 10th-anniversary model, and Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed the glass and stainless steel device “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” “It’s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I‘m excited,” builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two phones as the first person in the queue. Behman said he camped outside the store for a week and said he plans to sell the phones on for around A$3,000 each. “I‘m here for the profit, of course, it’s business,” he said. Apple opened pre-orders for the iPhone X on Oct. 27 and has said demand has been “off the charts,” although some analysts have been worried about supply chain issues that might prevent the company from making enough phones to satisfy demand. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday the company was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing, noting that “production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period.” Apple forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue of $84-87 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $84.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net income rose to $10.71 billion in the fourth quarter from $9.01 billion a year earlier. The iPhone X comes a decade after the original iPhone, the product that powered Apple’s rise to become the world’s biggest technology company with a market capitalization of $862 billion. Apple for years has sought to make the release of its new phones a landmark event. But this year it took the unusual step of a staggered launch, releasing the iPhone 8 - essentially an incremental advance over the iPhone 7 - several weeks earlier than the iPhone X. The most immediately noticeable change to the iPhone X from previous models is the removal of the physical home button and fingerprint sensor that customers use to unlock the device. The phone is instead unlocked with a so-called Face ID system, which uses a depth-sensing camera on the front of the phone to let the user unlock it with his or her face.

"2017-11-06",-1,"The finding is surprising because technology products tend to become more profitable as they age and the parts for them drop in cost. The iPhone X is a brand new design that went on sale on Friday, to apparently strong demand, while the iPhone 8 is an update on last year’s iPhone 7, which itself was similar to the iPhone 6 released in 2014. Apple declined to comment on TechInsights’ analysis. Apple is unique in the electronics industry for its ability to charge a premium price for its latest devices and for its ability to maintain that price even when selling devices through third parties like telecom carriers, said Al Cowsky, the costing analyst for TechInsights, which planned to post the results to its site late on Monday. “Apple can be different here because they are the 800 pound gorilla,” Cowsky said. Several of Apple’s design choices for the iPhone X pushed up its price. In particular, its 5.8-inch (14.8 cm) edge-to-edge display and associated parts cost $65.50, compared with $36 for the iPhone 8’s 4.7-inch display, the analysis found. That is largely because the iPhone 8 uses older LCD technology, while the iPhone X uses what is called “Super AMOLED” technology, which allows for more vivid colors and a thinner overall design. Another pricey choice was the stainless steel chassis of the iPhone X, which cost $36 versus $21.50 for the aluminum housing of the iPhone 8. Cowsky said the steel is less likely than aluminum to bend when flexed, a problem that dogged the iPhone 6 when it came out. “This is their lesson learned from that,” he said. "
"2017-05-23",-4,"Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia’s digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France’s Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. “There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel,” said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an “accumulate” recommendation for Nokia shares.  “I have not given any value so far for Nokia’s digital health business, but might apply an option value to it.”  “(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centers,” he said. “It’s a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it.” Under the patent license agreement, Nokia will receive a “significant” upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. “It’s interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure,” said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December.

"2017-04-28",-9,"The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple‘s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said.     Through Thursday, Qualcomm’s shares had fallen 17 percent since Apple’s lawsuit. The stock — the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index — was down 0.7 percent at $52.86 in midday trading. "

The iPhone capabilities will come in Cochlear’s newest sound processor that sits outside the ear, the Nucleus 7, expected to be released in September. Users can upgrade the processor without a new implant. Colorado-based Cochlear’s processors gather sound from the environment, turning it into an electrical signal and send it to an electrode implanted in the ears of people with hearing loss. The improvement will help Russ Levanway, the founder of a small IT business called TekTegrity. Levanway lost most of his hearing when was 4 years old because of an illness, but cochlear implants let him hear close to normally in face-to-face conversations. Levanway ran his business for a decade mostly through emails and in-person meetings until Cochlear’s Bluetooth models came out a few years ago. “It works pretty well, but it’s not seamless. I have to join conference calls early and work out the glitches before the call starts,” Levanway said. “To hear Apple is doing something that connects directly with the implant, that’s tremendous.” Apple has also worked with hearing aide firms such as GN ReSound and Starkey, which can also connect directly to the iPhone. Apple developed the protocols with the firms and licenses it to them for free. Sarah Herrlinger, director of global accessibility policy for Apple, said a key challenge with implants was fact that audiologists do not always prescribe a matched set of Cochlear implants. Often doctors recommend one implant and one hearing aide, often from a different maker. “We had to figure out how you could do a bi-modal solution where you’re able to simultaneously pair, control and hear both of them running at the same time,” she said. “That was a really interesting engineering opportunity for us to solve.” "

As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,” Cook wrote. “The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and I’ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused,” Cook said.  “What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. Its scars last generations. History has taught us this time and time again, both in the United States and countries around the world,” Cook added.          Earlier on Wednesday, the company was disabling Apple Pay on several websites that sell attire and items in support of white nationalists and hate groups, several tech news websites reported.  Apple joined social media networks Twitter Inc and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc that were cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.

"2017-11-03",-3,"The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast a strong holiday quarter ahead, which will include the iPhone X that started selling on Nov. 3. “We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China, driving more than 20 percent iPhone unit growth and a revenue and earnings beat in 2018,” analyst Katy Huberty on Morgan Stanley said. The glass-and-steel $999 phone appeared to have brought back the frenzy associated with iPhone launches - long lines formed outside Apple stores across the world as fans flocked to buy the new phone. The company will make 30 million iPhone X units during the current quarter, Nomura Instinet analysts estimated, allaying production worries related to the phone. IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones. “We – and many others – had feared that guidance could be weaker, reflecting only 9 weeks of the flagship iPhone X and limitations on supply,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.

Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White is still the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, raising his target price further to $235.

Apple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag. Sales of iPad made a surprise comeback in the quarter and were up 15 percent from a year earlier. The company also hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold. Revenue from emerging markets, excluding China, rose 18 percent and remained a bright spot. Greater China, however, reported its sixth straight decline in revenue, hurt by customers switching to locally made phones. While most analysts said that increasing competition in China and a fast saturating smartphone market could lead to slowing growth for Apple, Raymond James’ analyst Tavis McCourt  said the launch of iPhone 8 could shore up demand China. “We believe there is significant pent up demand for the iPhone 8 in Greater China that will lead to a more than a doubling in demand from Greater China,” McCourt said.

Eros has expanded in recent years to add films in other Indian languages and says it now owns a library comprising more than 3,000 Indian films. Discussions are in very early stages, the source told Reuters on Monday, confirming a report in India’s Economic Times that said a deal could be worth around $1 billion. Eros could not be reached for comment, while Apple said it did not comment on “speculation” and Amazon declined to comment on “rumor and speculation”. Netflix also declined to comment. Netflix and Amazon have been working to secure exclusive Indian content for their respective platforms that both launched in the country last year. Eros began exploring strategic options about six months ago for its Indian content library, a second source told Reuters. The source, who also asked not to be named, said Eros had attempted to work out deals with top domestic broadcasters including Sony, Star, Viacom and Zee. The Eros library was worth less the $1 billion quoted in the ET report, the source said, adding Apple, which recently began assembling some of its lower-end iPhones in India, was unlikely to splurge on Indian content. Apple has been vying to boost its share of the price-conscious Indian market, where its iPhones account for only a small sliver of smartphones sold. EROS’ TROUBLES Eros’ New York-listed parent company faces a class action lawsuit for allegedly overstating the subscriber base of its streaming portal Eros Now.    Its stock, which peaked at $39 on the NYSE in August 2015, has fallen nearly 80 percent in the last two years and closed at $8.20 on the NYSE on Friday.

Shares in the Indian entity closed 4.5 percent higher on Monday.  The Indian arm of Eros said in a statement it was “not privy to any strategic discussion” its parent might be having. The Economic Times report said Eros was planning to embark on a restructuring exercise that was likely to lead to a reverse merger of its New York-listed arm with the Indian subsidiary by the end of this financial year, creating a single listed entity. JM Financial, which the Economic Times said is advising Eros, did not respond to requests for comment.   "
"2017-04-25",5,"By Anna Serafin April 25 (Reuters) - AMS shares jumped as much as 20 percent a day after the Austrian chip maker reported first-quarter revenue above its own expectations, and said it might increase its mid-term revenue growth target on strong customer demand. AMS supplies smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung with optical sensors that help adjust the brightness and colours on screens. Excitement around the iPhone 8 has boosted some Apple suppliers’ stocks so far this year. AMS has been one of the biggest beneficiaries with its shares more than doubling. ZKB analyst Andreas Müller said AMS was also poised to benefit in the current quarter from the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8. AMS said on Monday it expected revenues of 174 million to 181 million euros ($197.13 million) for the second quarter, a big jump from 149.3 mln euros it reported in the first quarter. “AMS reported an impressive start to the year ... the outlook demonstrates that demand is strong for its portfolio of sensing solutions, even more so than that previously forecast,” Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner wrote in a note to clients. The company has also increased its capital expenditure forecast to ramp up capacities at its facilities, citing significantly increased customer forecasts and a higher revenue pipeline for 2017. Müller said he believed these capacity expansions were not just linked to the iPhones, but also to some new Chinese customers. AMS is now “more confident” that all projects are ramping, the company said in a conference call, but it declined to comment on customer specific project pipelines. Apple’s suppliers are also in the spotlight after Imagination Technologies revealed earlier this month that Apple plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house. Shares in another supplier Dialog Semiconductor were hit when an analyst report suggested it could lose a big Apple supply deal. AMS shares were last up 15 percent at 61.90 Swiss francs and topped the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. ($1 = 0.9182 euros) "
"2017-05-02",1,"The average selling price of iPhones is important to Apple because the smartphone market is maturing and its growth slowing. Apple’s ability to get more cash for each phone sold is critical to growing its profits.  “One of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call on Tuesday, in response to a question about how supply of its top-end phone was constrained during the holiday shopping season.  “The demand was much stronger for the 7 Plus than we had predicted, and so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred this past quarter.” The popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus model represents a triumph for Apple with a new departure: packing a unique feature into its most expensive iPhone. The iPhone 6 Plus differed from its smaller sibling only in screen size, but the 7 Plus model has a physically different camera that enables what Apple calls “portrait mode” for taking shots with a blurred background - a feature more commonly found on large, expensive digital cameras. It is a strategy Apple could use again. Many analysts believe the company will reserve certain features for the premium-priced model of its next, eagerly awaited iPhone - such as a higher-quality display - that could sell for more than $1,000.  So far, customers seem to be willing to pay more for the extra camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which is one reason that Apple made slightly more revenue selling slightly fewer iPhones in the latest quarter than a year ago, for an average price of $656. That price was 2 percent higher than 12 months ago, the best improvement in a year. During 2016, selling prices even went into a decline, year on year, during the iPhone 6s cycle after soaring on the release of the original iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced larger screens to the Apple lineup for the first time. “The important thing is the average selling price should not fall,” said Anil Doradla, a research analyst with William Blair & Co. “I have full confidence that it won‘t. Apple just doesn’t cut pricing to gain market share. It’s not in their DNA.” "
"2017-08-17",-3,"Cook also said in the letter that Apple will donate $1 million a piece to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League and will match two-for-one their donations to the organizations and other human rights groups until Sept. 30.  “Regardless of your political views, we must all stand together on this one point — that we are all equal. As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,” Cook wrote. “The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and I’ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused,” Cook said.  “What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. Its scars last generations. History has taught us this time and time again, both in the United States and countries around the world,” Cook added.          Earlier on Wednesday, the company was disabling Apple Pay on several websites that sell attire and items in support of white nationalists and hate groups, several tech news websites reported.  Apple joined social media networks Twitter Inc and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc that were cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.

"2017-09-19",3,"The most visible changes will come to App Store. The App Store is the backbone of Apple’s services segment, which brought in $21.5 billion in revenue in the past nine months, a 19 percent increase over the previous year and a bright spot as overall sales grew only 5 percent. The store has been redesigned to give app developers more space for images and text to describe their software. Developers have long grumbled that their software is hard to find in Apple’s store unless users type in the precise name of the app or follow a link to it. “The redesign make it much cleaner and speaks to the pain point of the store: You had so many apps that if you didn’t know exactly what you were looking for, it was really hard to find anything,” said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Most of that revenue comes in the form of so-called in-app purchases, where gamers make purchases of tokens, gems and other digital items to unlock new parts of the game. “It’s really the gift that keep on giving from the developer perspective,” Milanesi said. But perhaps the biggest change in iOS 11 will the debut of augmented reality apps, or AR, in which digital images float over the real word. Apple has made much of those a capabilities, but an ostensibly minor feature may help AR apps spread: Screen recording. In testing, Adam Debreczeni, maker of an app that lets users see a three-dimensional map of a fitness activity like a bicycle ride or run they’ve gone on, was surprised at how enthusiastically users took to sharing screen recordings of AR apps like his. “I think that’s going to help AR games go viral and get better distribution,” he said.

"2017-05-02",-4,"“Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York.   Only about a third of large-cap core mutual funds are ahead of the 6.7 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index for the year to date, leaving portfolio managers struggling to prove their worth at a time when low-priced index funds and exchange traded funds that mimic benchmarks continue to take market share, Rosenbluth said. The UBS ranking was based on institutional investment in individual stocks. The total dollar holdings in a stock were compared to the size of the overall fund portfolio to calculate the stock’s “investor weight.” This was later compared with “the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight.” For its part, global fund managers’ “investor weight” of Apple stood at 1.3 percent while their “active weight” positioning was negative 0.6 percent, UBS data showed. In a regulatory filing, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, up from just from 15.2 million shares three months earlier. Shares of Apple are up about 26.8 percent for the year to date in anticipation of a new iPhone model expected to be released in September marking the 10th anniversary of its flagship product.  Sales of the iPhone, which account for 69.4 percent of Apple’s total revenue, were larger than expected in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, helping mitigate concerns about consumers switching to cheaper alternatives or holding on to their current phones longer. “You’re not seeing a slowdown in demand ahead of a major upgrade year, and there’s a potential for higher costs and margins with the new model,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.

The decision was criticised by the Obama administration which said the European Union was helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the United States. The Trump administration, which has tentatively proposed a tax break on $2.6 trillion in corporate profits being held offshore as part of its tax reform, has not said anything in public about the case. “I can confirm the United States filed an application with the European Union General Court to intervene in the case involving the retroactive application of state aid rules to Apple,” said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The General Court is expected to hear the case in late 2018, another source with knowledge of the matter said. Apple has said it was a convenient target for the EU and that the EU competition enforcer used an “absurd theory” to come up with a punitive figure.

At least eight brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Barclays making the most bullish move by raising its price target by $23 to $146. The median price target on the stock is $165. “There is no reason for opportunistic investors to trek to the sidelines given the June-quarter print and Sept-quarter guide,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a client note. Apple on Tuesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and indicated that its upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone lineup was on schedule. Apple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag. Sales of iPad made a surprise comeback in the quarter and were up 15 percent from a year earlier. The company also hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold. Revenue from emerging markets, excluding China, rose 18 percent and remained a bright spot. Greater China, however, reported its sixth straight decline in revenue, hurt by customers switching to locally made phones. While most analysts said that increasing competition in China and a fast saturating smartphone market could lead to slowing growth for Apple, Raymond James’ analyst Tavis McCourt  said the launch of iPhone 8 could shore up demand China. “We believe there is significant pent up demand for the iPhone 8 in Greater China that will lead to a more than a doubling in demand from Greater China,” McCourt said. "
"2017-08-01",-3,"Apple also said it hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold.  The April-June quarter is traditionally a soft one for Apple as the market waits for the September launch of new iPhone models. But Tuesday’s results show that iPhone buyers may be less inclined than they once were to delay purchases until a new model is out.  The iPad product lines also showed unexpected strength, service revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, and even the much-maligned Apple Watch showed a 50 percent sales increase. Apple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag. The phone is expected to launch in September. The company forecast total revenue of between $49 billion and $52 billion for the current fourth quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $49.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple’s fourth quarter generally includes first-weekend sales of the company’s latest devices. The forecast “makes it fairly certain that at least some new iPhone models will be released on the normal schedule,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “That doesn’t necessarily mean all new models will go on sale then, or that they’ll all be in abundant supply, but I would think it means that at the very least the successors to the current phones will be available.” But Bob O‘Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple releases cheaper models before the premium models in its 10th anniversary phone lineup, the cheaper models could dampen sales of more expensive units released closer to the holidays. The company said iPhone sales rose 1.6 percent to 41.03 million in the third quarter ended July 1, above analysts’ average estimate of 40.7 million units, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones a year earlier. But a lower average iPhone selling price of $606, well below Wall Street expectations of $621, caused iPhone revenue to come in at $24.8 billion, below expectations of $25.5 billion. Apple reports how many phones it sells to retailers, not how many phones it sells to consumers, what is known as a sell-in basis. When factoring how many existing “high end” phones the company cleared out of retail inventory, Maestri said average selling prices were higher. The company’s net income rose to $8.72 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $7.80 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $45.41 billion from $42.36 billion in the quarter, typically the company’s weakest, beating expectations of $44.89 billion. The decline was smaller than recent quarters. Apple’s Maestri said mainland China revenue was flat, as were iPhone sales in the mainland. Sales of other Apple products rose in mainland China and were also up in Taiwan. “The decline from a market standpoint was concentrated in Hong Kong, which is a place that has been really affected by a reduction in tourism because the Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,” Maestri said. Apple CEO Tim Cook also directly addressed the company’s decision to remove so-called VPN apps from the App Store in China. Those apps help Chinese users circumnavigate government internet restrictions. “We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business,” Cook said. “We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. This particular case, we’re hopeful that over time the restrictions we’re seeing are lessened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate.” Strong iPad sales of $4.9 billion - almost $1 billion above Wall Street expectations - and a 21.6 percent jump in the company’s services business that includes the App Store also helped boost revenue. In particular, Apple said that Walmart Stores Inc would buy 19,000 iPads to train as many as 225,000 employees. The company also said it increased production of AirPods, its wireless headphones.  Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to directly address U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims that Apple will build three new factories in the U.S., instead citing the company’s job creation efforts and a $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund. Cook also hinted that Apple’s experiments with self-driving cars may include ambitions that extend beyond cars. He said the company is making a “big investment” in autonomous systems. “From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects,” Cook said. “And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don’t want to go any further with that.” "
"2017-09-22",-3,"In Australia, hundreds of people usually gather at Apple’s Sydney city store, with queues winding down George Street in the central business district. But there were fewer than 30 people lining up before the store opened on Friday, according to a Reuters witness. Apple’s flagship store in London’s Regent Street also experienced a slim turnout, according to several British newspapers. Shares of the company were down 1.3 percent to $151.39 in afternoon trading. The stock has lost 6.3 percent since closing at $161.50 on Sept. 11, a day before its new products were announced. While the number of people queuing up outside Apple stores has dropped over the past several years with many buyers choosing to shop online, the weak turnout for the latest iPhone has partly been due to poor reviews.   Mazen Kourouche, who was first in line in Sydney after lining up 11 days outside the store so he could buy and review the product on YouTube, said there were modest refinements. “(It) is pretty similar to the iPhone 7 but it shoots 4k 60 frames per second and it’s got a new glass back instead of the metal which is apparently more durable,” he told Reuters. “There aren’t too many new features to this one.” In China, a loyal Apple customer said the improved camera was one of the reasons she had bought the new device. “I waited until midnight to watch the launch event with my boyfriend to learn what’s new with this iPhone. Its photograph function is pretty good. So I think I must change with no hesitation,” said Ta Na, a 29-year-old consumer in Shanghai. In San Francisco, customers waiting in line were evenly split between those interested in the iPhone 8 and those looking to buy the Apple Watch Series 3. The latest watch includes standalone cellular data connectivity for the first time, meaning it can be used to make phone calls without an iPhone nearby.  Chayce O‘Neal, 27, said he had come to buy the new watch and wasn’t discouraged by reviews that mentioned connectivity problems. But he was skipping the iPhone 8 and holding out for the iPhone X.  “I like being on top of the cutting edge of technology,” he said.  The iPhone 8 will only cater to those who want a new version but do not want to pay a hefty $999 for the iPhone X, said iTWire.com’s technology editor Alex Zaharov-Reutt, who did not line up for the launch. That was the case for Damien Roberts, a customer in line at Apple’s San Francisco store. Roberts owns a battered iPhone 6s and wanted an upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus for phone calls, messages and playing his favorite video game “Clash of Clans.” He said he didn’t need the extra features of the $999 iPhone X. “It’s a lot of money to shell out for a phone,” said Roberts, a Briton who was purchasing the phone while on vacation. Speaking to CNBC, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the Apple Watch with cellular data service is “sold out in so many places around the world” and iPhone 8 models were also sold out. He did not specify the locations he was referring to. The iPhone X is a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Cook has called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone”. “I think it’ll be more lively with more people with the iPhone X,” said Ray Yokoyama, after buying an iPhone 8 in Tokyo.

"2017-11-01",-1,"For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales. “Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one. Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced. The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”. Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment. Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6. APPLE “GEEKS” Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8. “I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.” While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.  “My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.” Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security. “People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall. Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients. A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”. Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits. “I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.” Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy. Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S. “The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.” (For graphic on China chatter about iPhone X, click: tmsnrt.rs/2cbIZ5n) "
"2017-04-11",-16,"Apple had filed the lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The lawsuit came days after the U.S. government accused the chipmaker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. “It (Apple) has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm,” the chipmaker said in a statement on Monday. Qualcomm filed counterclaims to Apple’s lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The chipmaker said in the statement that Apple interfered in its agreements with licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads. Qualcomm also said Apple threatened it in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones, and misrepresented performance differences between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems. Responding to the chipmaker’s statement, Apple said it is reiterating its comments made in January that Qualcomm had overcharged royalties and gained from Apple’s technologies not related to Qualcomm’s patents. Apple also filed in January a lawsuit against Qualcomm in Beijing, alleging the chip supplier abused its clout in the chip industry and seeking 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages, according to Beijing’s Intellectual Property Court."
"2017-10-04",-3,"By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it was taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice for its failure to recover up to 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) of tax due from Apple Inc, a move labelled as “regrettable” by Dublin. The Commission ordered the U.S. tech giant in August 2016 to pay the unpaid taxes as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid, one of a number of deals the EU has targeted between multinationals and usually smaller EU states. “More than one year after the Commission adopted this decision, Ireland has still not recovered the money,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, adding that Dublin had not even sought a portion of the sum. “We of course understand that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition,” she added. The Commission said the deadline for Ireland to implement its decision had been Jan. 3 this year and that, until the aid was recovered, the company continued to benefit from an illegal advantage.  Apple is appealing the case. Vestager, who was also announcing a demand for Amazon to pay about 250 million euros in taxes to Luxembourg, declined to comment on possible penalties on Ireland if it were not to comply with an eventual ECJ ruling against it. Ireland’s finance ministry said it had never accepted the Commission’s analysis in the Apple state aid decision, but was committed to collecting the money due pending Dublin’s own appeal of the ruling. Ireland, it said, had been in constant contact with the Commission and Apple for more than a year and was close to setting up an escrow account. This would include the hiring of at least one investment manager to handle the fund. “It is extremely regrettable that the Commission has taken this action, especially in relation to a case with such a large scale recovery amount,” the ministry said in a statement. Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that in addition to work on the escrow account, the government was in “commercially sensitive” talks with Apple about the exact terms of the transfer. “I believe we will get a good outcome at the end of it,” Donohoe told state broadcaster RTE. Vestager told a news conference that in other cases of illegal tax advantages, such as Fiat in Luxembourg, Starbucks in the Netherlands and a Belgian scheme for 35 companies, the money was recovered even before appeals were exhausted. However, the amounts involved were far smaller. The Commission said that Ireland had made progress on calculating the exact amount due, but was only planning to conclude the work by March 2018 at the earliest. Ireland, like the Benelux countries, faces criticism from bigger EU states that they are siphoning off tax revenues and the bloc’s governments are negotiating reforms. French President Emmanuel Macron applauded the latest efforts of the European Commission in a tweet on Friday. “Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said.

"2017-05-02",3,"Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world’s most valuable listed company down 1.9 percent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier.  Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated.  The company reports what are called “sell-in” figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than “sell-through” figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers.  Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September.  A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. “There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter’s miss,” said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. “If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn’t confident it will beat those expectations.” The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. Analysts on average had expected $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $52.90 billion in the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $53.02 billion. A 17.5 percent jump in the company’s services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud - to $7.04 billion, boosted revenue. “We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple’s revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 percent to $10.73 billion in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company’s services were strong in China during the March quarter. “The performance we’re seeing in China should get better going forward this year,” he said. Apple’s gross margin hit 38.9 percent, slightly ahead of analysts’ average expectation of 38.7 percent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, versus analysts’ expectation of 38.3 percent, according to FactSet. “NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining,” Maestri said. "

"2017-02-27",2,"Currently, most of SAP’s systems are used on personal computers rather than on mobile devices. SAP plans to change that by working directly with Apple on software tools that will make it easier to access data on SAP systems from apps on an iPhone or iPad, an effort that began last spring. The tool could, for example, let employees log into business apps with fingerprint readers common on iPhones rather than a password, or replace bulky inventory scanning guns used in warehouses with iPhones. With growth in iPhone sales losing steam, Apple has increased its efforts to sell to large businesses. In 2014, Apple launched a partnership with IBM Corp to help build custom iOS applications for businesses. In 2016, Apple made a deal with Cisco to make iPhones work better on Cisco’s networking gear, and it also partnered with Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] to encourage more businesses to build iOS applications. The SAP partnership also gives iOS developers a new way to gain revenue in an era when most of the App Store’s growth is driven by downloads in China and by game makers. Apple said earlier this year that developers made $20 billion from the App Store in 2016, an increase of 40 percent from 2015. But according to App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks App Store metrics, iOS downloads were up only 12 percent in 2016 to 30 billion apps, and 80 percent of download growth for iOS apps came from China. Moreover, 75 percent of revenue generated in the App Store came from games, App Annie reported. Business apps would represent new territory for many of these developers. And being able to run workplace software could also help Apple compete against Microsoft Corp , whose Windows software still dominates in the corporate world. "

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones. Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday. The base price for the phone is $999. He noted that Sprint Corp’s  iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.  However, electronics retailer Best Buy Co is charging shoppers an extra $100, if they wish to buy an unactivated iPhone X outright. If customers order the phone on an installment billing plan, they will pay the same price charged by Apple and the carriers. “Our prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer’s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy,” Best Buy spokeswoman Carly Charlson said.  “Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.” "

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already cancelled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits. “I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I cancelled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.” Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy. Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S. “The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.” ($1 = 6.6272 Chinese yuan renminbi) "
"2017-10-05",0,"“More than one year after the Commission adopted this decision, Ireland has still not recovered the money,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, adding that Dublin had not even sought a portion of the sum. “We of course understand that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition,” she added. The Commission said the deadline for Ireland to implement its decision had been Jan. 3 this year and that, until the aid was recovered, the company continued to benefit from an illegal advantage.  Apple is appealing the case. Vestager, who was also announcing a demand for Amazon (AMZN.O) to pay about 250 million euros in taxes to Luxembourg, declined to comment on possible penalties on Ireland if it were not to comply with an eventual ECJ ruling against it. Ireland’s finance ministry said it had never accepted the Commission’s analysis in the Apple state aid decision, but was committed to collecting the money due pending Dublin’s own appeal of the ruling. Ireland, it said, had been in constant contact with the Commission and Apple for more than a year and was close to setting up an escrow account. This would include the hiring of at least one investment manager to handle the fund. Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that in addition to work on the escrow account, the government was in “commercially sensitive” talks with Apple about the exact terms of the transfer.  “I believe we will get a good outcome at the end of it,” Donohoe told state broadcaster RTE.  Vestager told a news conference that in other cases of illegal tax advantages, such as Fiat (FCHA.MI) in Luxembourg, Starbucks (SBUX.O) in the Netherlands and a Belgian scheme for 35 companies, the money was recovered even before appeals were exhausted. However, the amounts involved were far smaller. The Commission said that Ireland had made progress on calculating the exact amount due, but was only planning to conclude the work by March 2018 at the earliest. Ireland, like the Benelux countries, faces criticism from bigger EU states that they are siphoning off tax revenues and the bloc’s governments are negotiating reforms. French President Emmanuel Macron applauded the latest efforts of the European Commission in a tweet on Friday. “Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said.

"2017-04-05",0,"More recently, when Apple bought the headphone company Beats Electronics, part of a $3 billion deal in 2014, it ripped out the existing, off-the-shelf communications chips and replaced them with its own custom-designed W1 Bluetooth chip. “Apple clearly got rid of all the conventional suppliers and replaced about five chips with one,” said Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside electronics devices. “Today we do much more in-house development of fundamental technologies than we used to,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said at a February conference. “Think of the work we do on processors or sensors. We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality.” Most vendors of consumer electronics products rely on outside suppliers for chip design and development, primarily because it is extremely expensive. That has created huge opportunities for companies like ARM, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which have developed core technologies for processing, communications and graphics that are used by scores of vendors. Now, though, Apple is so big that it can economically  create its own designs, or license small pieces of others’ work and build on it. As with ARM and Qualcomm, the actual manufacturing of the chips is still contracted out to a semiconductor foundry, such as those run by Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW). It may also help the company move faster - and save money -  as it focuses on new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality. Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple plans to integrate augmented reality into its products, which makes 3-D sensors and graphics chips like Imagination’s especially important. Even before formally cutting off Imagination, Apple had given hints that it was preparing to design its own graphics processors. Specifically, it introduced a piece of its own code called Metal for app developers. App developers use Metal to make their apps talk to the graphics chip on the iPhone. By putting a piece of Apple-designed code between app developers and the phone’s chip, Apple has made it possible to swap out the chip without interrupting how the developers work. That could also make it easier to bridge the gap for developers between the graphics chips on Apple’s phones and its desktop computers, which currently require some separate coding. “By promoting Metal instead of relying on other existing standards, Apple is not only able to control what graphics chip functionality is exposed at its own pace, but also blur the line for developers between coding for desktop and mobile GPUs,” said Pius Uzamere, the founder of a virtual reality startup called Ether. Taking control of the iPhone’s chips can also help Apple keep costs down, which is especially important as it gears up for a feature-laden new iPhone this fall. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co said in a research note that he thinks the curved screens expected on the new phone could add as much as $50 in cost, for example.  Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimates that the average price of an iPhone increased only 1 percent to $695 last quarter, while costs increased 8 percent to $420, resulting in an iPhone gross margin of 39.6 percent. That is down from the 44 percent average gross margin for iPhones in 2015, according to Seyrafi’s estimates. Apple spends only $75 million a year on licensing fees for Imagination’s chips. But licensing fees to chip designers, taken together, are a significant cost for the iPhone. Apple recently sued Qualcomm for $1 billion over licensing terms for its communications chips - which Apple would have trouble designing in-house because of patent issues. "
"2017-10-19",-1,"The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X. But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.   Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released. “I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call. “As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”  The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.  “The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.  “iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”  When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X. But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone  marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.  A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week. But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.  “They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.  There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.  Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device. "

"2017-02-27",2,"Currently, most of SAP’s systems are used on personal computers rather than on mobile devices. SAP plans to change that by working directly with Apple on software tools that will make it easier to access data on SAP systems from apps on an iPhone or iPad, an effort that began last spring. The tool could, for example, let employees log into business apps with fingerprint readers common on iPhones rather than a password, or replace bulky inventory scanning guns used in warehouses with iPhones. With growth in iPhone sales losing steam, Apple has increased its efforts to sell to large businesses. In 2014, Apple launched a partnership with IBM Corp to help build custom iOS applications for businesses. In 2016, Apple made a deal with Cisco to make iPhones work better on Cisco’s networking gear, and it also partnered with Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] to encourage more businesses to build iOS applications. The SAP partnership also gives iOS developers a new way to gain revenue in an era when most of the App Store’s growth is driven by downloads in China and by game makers. Apple said earlier this year that developers made $20 billion from the App Store in 2016, an increase of 40 percent from 2015. But according to App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks App Store metrics, iOS downloads were up only 12 percent in 2016 to 30 billion apps, and 80 percent of download growth for iOS apps came from China. Moreover, 75 percent of revenue generated in the App Store came from games, App Annie reported. Business apps would represent new territory for many of these developers. And being able to run workplace software could also help Apple compete against Microsoft Corp , whose Windows software still dominates in the corporate world. "

Excitement around the iPhone 8 has boosted some Apple suppliers’ stocks so far this year. AMS has been one of the biggest beneficiaries with its shares more than doubling. ZKB analyst Andreas Müller said AMS was also poised to benefit in the current quarter from the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8. AMS said on Monday it expected revenues of 174 million to 181 million euros ($197.13 million) for the second quarter, a big jump from 149.3 mln euros it reported in the first quarter. “AMS reported an impressive start to the year ... the outlook demonstrates that demand is strong for its portfolio of sensing solutions, even more so than that previously forecast,” Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner wrote in a note to clients. The company has also increased its capital expenditure forecast to ramp up capacities at its facilities, citing significantly increased customer forecasts and a higher revenue pipeline for 2017. Müller said he believed these capacity expansions were not just linked to the iPhones, but also to some new Chinese customers. AMS is now “more confident” that all projects are ramping, the company said in a conference call, but it declined to comment on customer specific project pipelines.

Eros has expanded in recent years to add films in other Indian languages and says it now owns a library comprising more than 3,000 Indian films. Discussions are in very early stages, the source told Reuters on Monday, confirming a report in India’s Economic Times that said a deal could be worth around $1 billion. Eros could not be reached for comment, while Apple said it did not comment on “speculation” and Amazon declined to comment on “rumor and speculation”. Netflix also declined to comment. Netflix and Amazon have been working to secure exclusive Indian content for their respective platforms that both launched in the country last year. Eros began exploring strategic options about six months ago for its Indian content library, a second source told Reuters. The source, who also asked not to be named, said Eros had attempted to work out deals with top domestic broadcasters including Sony, Star, Viacom and Zee. The Eros library was worth less the $1 billion quoted in the ET report, the source said, adding Apple, which recently began assembling some of its lower-end iPhones in India, was unlikely to splurge on Indian content. Apple has been vying to boost its share of the price-conscious Indian market, where its iPhones account for only a small sliver of smartphones sold. EROS’ TROUBLES Eros’ New York-listed parent company faces a class action lawsuit for allegedly overstating the subscriber base of its streaming portal Eros Now.

"2017-04-11",-1,"Apple accounted for more than 70 percent of Dialog’s 2016 sales, analysts estimate. The German company says it is the world’s top maker of power management chips used in smartphones with roughly 20 percent of the market. Shares in Dialog fell as much as 36 percent on Tuesday to a seven-month low. They had more than doubled in the second half of 2016 on rising expectations for the iPhone 8 due out later in 2017.  Dialog said it saw no business reason for the share drop and that it remained comfortable with its financial outlook for “good revenue growth” in 2017, which would mark a recovery from a 12-percent decline last year. “The company notes the level of visibility into the design cycle of its leading customers remains unchanged and the business relationships are in line with the normal course of business,” it said in a statement. By 1340 GMT, the Dialog shares had pared losses and were 15 percent lower at 40.49 euros ($42.97). Apple’s suppliers are in the spotlight after Imagination Technologies IMG.L last week revealed Apple’s plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house, sending shudders through Apple’s global supply chain.  Imagination’s stock plunged 70 percent. Bankhaus Lampe cited unnamed industry sources as saying that Apple was setting up power management design centers both in Munich and California and said Apple already had around 80 engineers working on a power management chip of its own. “In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen said, referring to power management chips. Lampe’s Iltgen is a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Dialog and ranks sixth among 16 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Apple was recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich. “They are poaching like crazy,” the person said. Apple declines to comment on matters involving its supplier relationships and did not respond to a request for comment for this story. A trader with brokerage Exane, who said he had been in contact with Dialog management, said investors were overreacting to speculation that Dialog might lose Apple’s business. He said Dialog has completed designs for chips that Apple plans to use in 2017 and 2018 iPhone models while it continues to discuss with Apple using its parts in 2019 phones. The trader also said Apple would need to hire more than 1,000 engineers to completely replace the power management chips supplied by Dialog. Dialog has made several attempts to diversify beyond Apple and other smartphone customers in the past few years.  In 2014, merger talks between Dialog and Austrian sensor chip maker Ams AG (AMS.S) fell apart after they failed to come to terms. Its plans to buy U.S.-based Atmel in 2015 were derailed after Microchip (MCHP.O) swooped in with a higher bid. Apple has outsourced production of its hardware products to an extended network of suppliers, large and small, while it has moved over the past decade to design its own central processors and added functions like fingerprint recognition since then. Over the past dozen years, Apple suppliers CSR, PortalPlayer, Sigmatel and Wolfson have been replaced, pushing them eventually to merge with more diversified players. But Apple still relies on key suppliers to develop innovations ranging from image and motion sensors to power management.  Other chip suppliers for the current iPhone 7 include, but are not limited to, Cirrus Logic (CRUS.O), NXP (NXPI.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Skyworks (SWKS.O), STMicroelectronics (STM.PA), according to an analysis by TechInsights in September. Shares in highly diversified chipmaker STMicro, which analysts believe supplies light sensors for iPhones, fell 3.6 percent, weighing on the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 Technology .SX8P index, which was down 1.5 percent.

Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimates that the average price of an iPhone increased only 1 percent to $695 last quarter, while costs increased 8 percent to $420, resulting in an iPhone gross margin of 39.6 percent. That is down from the 44 percent average gross margin for iPhones in 2015, according to Seyrafi’s estimates. Apple spends only $75 million a year on licensing fees for Imagination’s chips. But licensing fees to chip designers, taken together, are a significant cost for the iPhone. Apple recently sued Qualcomm for $1 billion over licensing terms for its communications chips - which Apple would have trouble designing in-house because of patent issues."
"2017-04-03",-7,"“The biggest risk to Imagination’s business model was realized this morning,” analysts at Investec said. “The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company.”  MORE FROM REUTERS   * Video: Inventor hopes eTrike will succeed where uncle failed  * Tesla first-quarter vehicle deliveries jumped 69 percent   * In self-driving car race, winners get all the way around track  The technology company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics.  Imagination said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead.  “It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information,” Chief Executive Andrew Heath said.  “As such we do not accept their assertion that they no longer require our technology.”  The company said it had asked Apple for evidence that it could dispense with all of Imagination’s technology, “but Apple has declined to provide it”.  Apple declined to comment.  Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012.  They were down 64 percent at 97 pence by 1350 GMT, giving the company a market value of 275 million pounds ($372 million), or 479 million pounds less than it was worth on Friday.  “There is a difference here though”, they said. “Imagination holds significant patents around graphics cores, in particular those which allow lower power use, and is considering discussing different commercial arrangements with Apple.”  Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel (INTC.O) bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012.  It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints.  Imagination says it has just over 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market - nearly all of which stems from Apple, although MediaTek (2454.TW) also selected its graphics for its new chipset last month.  But Imagination only has 7 percent of the market for mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to gain share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers.  Imagination said it would talk with Apple about alternative commercial arrangements.  Analysts said there could be room for compromise, and it could even be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties.  Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said.  Most of its costs are incurred in developing technologies years ahead of when they are deployed in products, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with Apple’s revenue.  Around half of its non-Apple revenue comes from the MIPS processing platform it bought in 2012 in an attempt to extend its product line-up beyond graphics.  Customers for the MIPS technology include Israeli automated vehicle driving systems specialist Mobileye MBLY.N and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications, according to analysts.  "

Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office’s ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili’s design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones.

"2017-04-14",-6,"The idea would be to allay Japanese government concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a potential risk to national security, the broadcaster said. Apple was not immediately available to comment. Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesman said he could not comment on specific transactions. Foxconn, which participated in the first round of the chip sale auction, has been considered a national security risk due to its ties with China. The bulk of Apple’s iPhones are made at Foxconn’s extensive manufacturing base there. NHK said Apple wants Foxconn to own a stake of around 30 percent of Toshiba’s chip business. An investment by Apple would be its first direct stake in a major global memory chipmaker, as it seeks to secure a stable supply of key components. Samsung Electronics  is the biggest maker of flash memory chips, followed by Toshiba, SK Hynix and U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc. The NHK report comes as Western Digital Corp, Toshiba’s partner and one of the bidders for its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm’s plans to sell its chip unit violates a joint venture contract. Western Digital wants to be given exclusive negotiating rights. The auction of Toshiba’s prized chips asset is essential to the company’s plans to cover multi-billion dollar writedowns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Those costs have plunged the Japanese conglomerate into crisis, prompting it even to warn that it may not be able to continue as a going concern.  Toshiba has narrowed the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors, sources have said: U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP; SK Hynix; Western Digital; and Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics maker. Shares in Toshiba fell more than 5 percent on Friday, hit by a Bloomberg report that the chip business sale had been temporarily put on hold to address the concerns raised by Western Digital. “It is not true Toshiba has put the chip sale process on hold,” a spokesman said. Access to fresh funds would help tide Toshiba over before it can complete the sale of the chips business. Some small lenders have baulked at the idea as they have been offered other Toshiba assets as collateral, such as group companies’ shares and real estate, but Toshiba’s main lenders expect all creditors to approve the move, the people said. In exchange for the chip unit stake as collateral, Toshiba hopes to get about 300 billion yen in fresh loans and be able to draw down existing loan commitments worth 680 billion yen. An executive at one of the main creditor banks said it was still uncertain if Western Digital would agree to Toshiba offering its chip unit stake as collateral. “We would be running risks of being sued by our shareholders if we provide loans to Toshiba without collateral,” the executive said.

"2017-07-25",1,"Trump didn’t elaborate on where those plants would be located or when they would be built, the paper reported. Cook said in May that Apple planned to create a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. companies that perform advanced manufacturing. He also said the company intended to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps. Apple came under fire from Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China. ""We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,"" Trump had said in a speech in January last year. (reut.rs/2tACzRk) Apple, on its part, had been making disclosures to highlight how it had been contributing to job creation in the United States. Cook said in February that Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its U.S. suppliers. The world’s largest company by market valuation had also claimed that it created 2 million jobs in the United States, 80,000 of which are directly at Apple and the rest coming from suppliers and developers for the company’s app ecosystem. Trump’s comments on Tuesday were some of the first he has made regarding Apple’s manufacturing since assuming the presidency. “I said you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won’t consider my administration an economic success,” the Journal quoted Trump as saying.      Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump also said that Foxconn (2317.TW), a major Apple supplier, plans to build a big plant in the United States and is “strongly considering” putting it in Wisconsin, the Journal reported. Foxconn said last month it plans to invest more than $10 billion in a display-making factory in the United States.   "

Solomon did not return a request for comment. Apple confirmed his departure but declined to comment further. The impact of Solomon’s departure on Apple’s enterprise efforts was not immediately available, but Apple has increased its efforts to sell to large businesses in recent years. In 2014, Apple launched a partnership with IBM to help build custom iOS applications for businesses. In 2016, Apple made a deal with Cisco so that iPhones would work better on Cisco’s networking gear and also partnered with Deloitte to encourage more businesses to build iOS applications. Speaking at a conference hosted by Box Inc in 2016, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple had about $25 billion in enterprise sales in the previous year. “This is not a hobby,” Cook said of Apple’s enterprise efforts.

"2017-10-12",-5,"Planning permission was granted by the local council six months later, but a series of appeals blocked Apple from beginning work.  High Court judge Paul McDermott on Thursday dismissed two separate appeals against the planning permission, clearing the way for the project to proceed.  Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.  A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple has announced it will build a second data center there. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met Apple executives last month and said they had made clear their frustration with the planning and judicial delays and warned the process would color decisions that they might make about future investments. The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly. It has said it will be one of the biggest capital investment projects in the west of Ireland, providing 300 construction jobs and 150 on-site permanent jobs. "
"2017-03-18",-3,"Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries.  “The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people,” said Cook, in a rare public speech.  Apple said on Friday it will set up two new research and development centers in Shanghai and Suzhou in China. It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war.  The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a “tit-for-tat” approach. "

"2017-02-10",-1,"The challenge in India is to increase the size of the addressable market. Premium phones over $500 account for less than 2 percent of smartphones. Apple dominates this segment and sold 2.5 million units in India last year, according to Counterpoint Research. That is impressive considering an iPhone retails for more in India than in the United States because of high import taxes and a lack of carrier subsidies.  Assembling handsets locally will help keep a tighter lid on costs. In return for agreeing to “Make in India”, and helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi create jobs, Apple may hope New Delhi will relax rules that currently prevent it from importing old phones. Selling refurbished models, such as the iPhone 5S, would make Apple handsets affordable to more people. The hope is these early customers will eventually upgrade to the latest models as incomes rise. It would also allow Apple to compete with local and Chinese rivals like OPPO and Huawei.  In the meantime, Apple is close to opening a store in the country. So even if the company can’t significantly lower prices or expand its market, a more visible presence will help ensure the brand is one people aspire to own. That is key to Apple’s future in India.

"2017-11-15",-12,"The government app was launched on Google’s Android platform last year, but an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter said Apple pushed back on requests for an iOS version due to concerns that a government app with access to call and text logs could compromise its customers’ privacy. Facing public criticism from the regulator, Apple executives flew to New Delhi last month and told officials the company would help develop the app, but only with limited capabilities, according to a government official aware of the matter.  Apple’s executives have told India that its current iOS platform might not allow for some of the government’s requests, such as making call logs available within the app that would allow users to report them as spam, the official said. “They (Apple) will help develop an app which, to an extent, can solve the requirements,” said the official. An Apple spokesman confirmed that the new iOS features to combat spam text messages would help the government build the app, but did not comment on the app’s potential inability to access call logs for reporting spam, as the Android version does. The spokesman said Apple had not changed its stance on privacy. Apple’s stand-off with the regulator comes at a time when it is seeking greater access in India, the world’s third-largest smartphone market. The company has been lobbying the government for tax breaks to expand its phone assembly operations in the country, where it reported doubling its revenue versus the previous year for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Balancing growth and market share with protecting customer privacy has become a defining challenge for global tech companies such as Apple, which regularly clash with governments over allowing access to content on their devices, especially for law enforcement needs.  “This has now become more of an ego tussle between Apple and the regulator,” said Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based technology research firm Counterpoint Research. He added that Apple was unlikely to agree to any requests specific to India because of the precedent that would set.     The chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) R.S. Sharma said he was unhappy with Apple for not responding swiftly to the government’s requests. “We’ve told them they are harming their consumers,” Sharma told Reuters in an interview. “I hope good sense prevails upon them.” Apple did not comment on TRAI’s criticism, but said that it had taken time to develop a privacy-friendly solution. TRAI’s anti-spam mobile application, also called Do Not Disturb, has been downloaded more than 100,000 times from the Google Android app section. Before the app launches, it asks the user to allow it access to contacts and view text messages. Users can then start reporting numbers as spam. A spokesman for Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not directly comment on the app, but said: “We believe in openness and in the ability of users to make purchasing and downloading choices without top-down enforcement or censorship. Users are prompted with requests for permissions that they can choose to accept or decline.” Apple, however, has been worried. TRAI said the app does not raise any privacy concerns. At least seven meetings have been held between the two sides and dozens of emails exchanged since last year, according to government officials and documents reviewed by Reuters. In August this year, months after the talks began, Apple wrote to TRAI saying that a technical meeting would help them establish “what is possible and not possible”. The TRAI pushed back.  “The whole exercise in organizing the proposed meeting would be a waste of resources ... please share concrete solutions that have a likelihood of addressing the issues we have been discussing over the past one year,” the regulator wrote in September. Later that month, Apple again approached the TRAI saying it had identified potential solutions but they would require additional discussions with the regulator’s technical staff. Horvath and other Apple executives met TRAI officials in October and conveyed they would help them develop the first version of the app with limited features. “They (Apple) are adopting dilatory tactics,” said Sharma, the TRAI chief. “They’ve had meetings, meetings and meetings.” "

"2017-02-02",0,"“Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,” the government of the south Indian state said in a statement. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters, however, that no deal, or memorandum of understanding had so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at a plant being set up by its Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp at Peenya on the outskirts of the tech hub of Bengaluru, Karnataka. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met with federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbying hard for a raft of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country. Following the meetings, Apple said it appreciated the open and constructive dialogue it held with Indian officials, around the expansion of its local operations in the country. Any final decision around manufacturing in India however, is likely to still be contingent on the government’s willingness to concede ground on the concessions sought by the company. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple’s request for incentives to invest in the country with an “open mind.” On its part, the government of Karnataka said on Thursday it was “committed to new initiatives in any sector for manufacturing and will provide a conducive environment for investment.”     (Writing by Euan Rocha.

"2017-05-04",1,"Apple is already the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, and its weight within the S&P 500 in recent decades has been rivaled only by Exxon Mobil and Microsoft.  The iPhone maker’s market capitalization recently reached a record $774 billion after increasing 27 percent so far in 2017. If Apple continues to grow at that rate, its market capitalization will hit $1 trillion in October. “Investors see the big numbers, the hoopla surrounding hitting one of these arbitrary levels...” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Hitting those milestones often attracts more investors,” she added. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 percent of the S&P 500 in September 2012, but its share of the index has since slipped to 3.8 percent. In comparison, Exxon Mobil accounted for 5.3 percent of the S&P 500 in December 2008, while Microsoft briefly accounted for 4.9 percent of the index in 2000.  Apple recently accounted for 15.1 percent of the S&P 500 technology index, down from a peak of 21.8 percent in 2012. The technology index recently traded at 17.4 times expected earnings, down a little from a month ago but otherwise near highs not seen since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  Shares of Apple edged down 0.3 percent on Wednesday after the company reported its March-quarter results on Tuesday and said sales of iPhones fell, surprising investors.  Still, at least four analysts raised their share price target for Apple.   While global smartphone sales have lost steam in recent years, investors remain optimistic that Apple will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with new models that give a major boost to sales.   The median analyst 12-month price target for Apple on Wednesday was $160. Hitting that target implies a 9 percent rise from current levels, which would put Apple’s market capitalization at $836 billion, excluding the effect of potential stock buybacks. Still, analyst price targets are a poor predictor of stock performance, and a stock’s past performance often says little about what it will do in the future. In February, Warren Buffett told CNBC that Apple was likely to hit a $1 trillion market value before his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $410 billion after its stock rose 2 percent so far in 2017.  Steep stock gains driven by optimism about upcoming iPhones are unlikely to continue at the same pace, said Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities. But he recommends the stock and even increased his own price target to $160 from $155 following Apple’s quarterly report.  “It’s a value play that should be bought at current levels,” Seyrafi said. (Corrects second paragraph to say $5 trillion, not $5 billion) "
"2017-07-29",-6,"In January, Beijing passed laws seeking to ban all VPNs that are not approved by state regulators. Approved VPNs must use state network infrastructure. In a statement on Sunday, an Apple spokeswoman confirmed it will remove apps that don’t comply with the law from its China App Store, including services based outside the country. Beijing has shut down dozens of China-based providers and it has been targeting overseas services as it bids to tighten its control over the internet, especially ahead of the Communist Party congress in August.     While personal VPN providers have been the subject of state-led attacks in the past, this marks the first time Apple has complied with requests to scrub overseas providers from its store, a move that VPN providers say is unnecessarily supportive of China’s heightened censorship regime.  VPN provider ExpressVPN said on Saturday that it had received a notice from Apple that its software would be removed from the China App Store “because it includes content that is illegal in China”. “We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts,” ExpressVPN said in a statement. Other major providers, including VyprVPN and StarVPN, confirmed they also received the notice on Saturday from Apple. “We view access to Internet in China as a human rights issue and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profit,” Sunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, which oversees VyprVPN told Reuters on Sunday.  Yokubaitis said Golden Frog will file an appeal to Apple over the ban. China users with billing addresses in other countries will still be able to access VPN apps from other branches of the App Store. A number of VPN apps were still accessible on the China App store on Saturday.    Apple is in the middle of a localization drive in China, and named a new managing director for the region - a new role - this month.  It is also establishing a data center with a local partner in the southwestern province of Guizhou to comply with new Chinese cloud storage regulations. VPN providers say that while the apps are not available on the store, users are still able to manually install them using VPN support built into Apple’s operating system. “We are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure,” said Yokubaitis. “(It’s been a) disappointing morning but we will fight on.” "
"2017-03-21",2,"“Thanks for welcoming me today, ofo team! Great energy behind your mission to make commuting greener, more efficient and fun!” Cook said in his official Sina Weibo post, along with pictures of him riding an ofo bike. Cook’s visit comes amid a fierce contest for users and investors among China’s bike-sharing start-ups, which has drawn in large global tech investors. The competition is frequently compared to a similar battle for the ride-sharing market between Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and local rival Didi Chuxing a year ago. Ofo, which counts Didi as an investor, said Cook came for a company visit on Tuesday and did not discuss investment or collaboration. It raised $450 million earlier this month and saw its valuation pass the $1 billion mark. Ofo and its main rival Mobike are among a growing number of bike-sharing services that have sprung up in China that allow users to find, unlock and pay to rent trackable bicycles through smartphone apps. It targets younger consumers seeking to get around congested roads and public transport. Ofo says it operates in 43 cities in China with 2.2 million bikes. It also claims pilot schemes in Singapore, London and California. Shanghai-based Mobike, which has raised more than $300 million so far this year from investors including Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), Warburg Pincus, and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, said on Tuesday it was fully launching in Singapore.

"2017-06-04",4,"By Stephen Nellis June 2 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is expected to announce plans this week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com Inc’s competing Alexa service. But the Cupertino, California company is likely to stick to its tested method of focusing on a small amount of features and trying to perfect them, rather than casting as wide a net as possible, according to engineers and artificial intelligence industry insiders. Currently, Apple’s Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company’s annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories. Some industry-watchers have also predicted Apple will announce hardware similar to Amazon’s Echo device for the home, which has been a hot-seller recently. Apple declined comment. But even if Siri doubles its areas of expertise, it will be a far cry from the 12,000 or so tasks that Amazon.com’s Alexa can handle. The difference illustrates a strategic divide between the two tech rivals. Apple is betting that customers will not use voice commands without an experience similar to speaking with a human, and so it is limiting what Siri can do in order to make sure it works well. Amazon puts no such restrictions on Alexa, wagering that the voice assistant with the most “skills,” its term for apps on its Echo assistant devices, will gain a loyal following, even if it sometimes makes mistakes and takes more effort to use. The clash of approaches is coming to a head as virtual assistants that respond to voice commands become a priority for the leading tech companies, which want to find new ways of engaging customers and make more money from shopping and online services. Apart from some basic home and music functions, Alexa needs more specific directions, using a limited set of commands such as “ask” or “tell.” For example, “Alexa, ask Uber for a ride,” will start the process of summoning a car, but “Alexa, order me an Uber” will not, because Alexa does not make the connection that it should open the Uber “skill.” After some setup, Alexa can order a pizza from Domino‘s, while Siri cannot get a pie because food delivery is not - so far - one of the categories of apps that Apple has opened up to Siri. “In typical Apple fashion, they’ve allowed for only a few use cases, but they do them very well,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, maker of an intelligent assistant app. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company does not comment on its plans for developers. Amazon said in a statement: “Our goal is to make speaking with Alexa as natural and easy as possible, so we’re looking at ways to improve this over time.” The potential of Apple’s original iPhone did not come to light until thousands of developers started building apps. McIlwain said he expects Apple to add new categories at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week, but not nearly enough to match Alexa’s number of skills. “To attract developers in the modern world, you need a platform,” McIlwain said. “If Apple does not launch a ‘skills store,’ that would be a mistake.” Neither Siri nor Alexa has a clear path to making money. Siri works as an additional tool for controlling traditional apps, and Apple pays money to owners of those apps. Alexa’s skills are free, and developers are not paid. At the moment, because of their limits, voice apps are “a side dish, not the entree,” according to Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Amazon was wise to not commit to an economic model at such an early state, Etzioni said. “Once a successful economic model for developers emerges, people are going to gravitate to it.” (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby)"

"2017-06-13",0,"Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products.  The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials.  Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten - an attempt to address criticism that Apple’s products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart.  Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius. "
"2017-06-07",-8,"By the end of 2017, Apple will to put its proprietary machines for mending cracked iPhone glass in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, company executives told Reuters.  Among the first recipients is Minneapolis-based Best Buy, which has long sold and serviced Apple products. The electronics retailer already has one of the screen-repair machines at a Miami-area store and one coming soon to an outlet in Sunnyvale, California.  Fixing cracked screens may seem like small potatoes, but it’s a multi-billion-dollar global business. The move is also a major shift for Apple. The company had previously restricted use of its so-called Horizon Machine to its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers; and it has guarded its design closely.  The change also comes as eight U.S. states have launched “right to repair” bills aimed at prying open the tightly controlled repair networks of Apple and other high-tech manufacturers. Apple said legislative pressure was not a factor in its decision to share its technology. It allowed Reuters to view and photograph the machines in action at a lab near its Cupertino, California headquarters. Until now, Apple had never formally acknowledged the Horizon Machine’s existence. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple’s 4,800 authorized service providers worldwide over the next few months. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year. “We’ve been on a quest to expand our reach,” said Brian Naumann, senior director of service operations at Apple. He said repair wait times have grown at some of the company’s busiest retail stores. Pilot testing started a year ago. In addition to Miami, a few machines already are operating at third-party repair centers in the Bay Area, London, Shanghai and Singapore. Shops in some countries where Apple has no retail presence will also be early recipients, including locations in Colombia, Norway and South Korea. Apple would not say how much its partners are paying for the equipment. To be sure, any mall repair kiosk can replace a cracked iPhone screen. Apple says its customers can get their devices fixed at non-authorized shops without voiding their warranties as long as the technician caused no damage. But the Horizon Machine is needed to remedy the trickiest mishaps, such as when the fingerprint sensor attached to the back of the glass gets damaged when a phone is dropped. For security, only Apple’s fix-it machine can tell the iPhone’s processor, its silicon brain, to recognize a replacement sensor. Without it, the iPhone won’t unlock with the touch of a finger. Banking apps that require a fingerprint won’t work either, including the Apple Pay digital wallet. “RIGHT TO REPAIR” GAINING STEAM Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones worldwide, many to customers who don’t live near an Apple Store or an authorized third-party repair center. For fixes, many have turned to mom-and-pop shops and independent technicians that now dominate the trade. Research firm IBISWorld estimates the global cell phone repair business generates about $4 billion in revenue per year. Many of these entrepreneurs do good work. Some don‘t. All use copycat parts because Apple, like other major manufacturers, doesn’t supply original parts or repair manuals to anyone but authorized service partners. Big companies defend this arrangement as the only way they can guarantee high-quality repair work and keep hackers away from the proprietary software that makes their products tick. Consumer advocates, however, say their aim is to wring outsized profits from repairs. Independent technicians often charge less than the cost of a factory fix.  These proposed measures would require manufacturers to supply repair manuals, diagnostic tools and authentic replacement parts at fair prices to independent technicians and the general public.  Apple, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc and medical device maker Medtronic Plc have lobbied against New York’s bill. In Nebraska, Apple sent its state and local lobbying chief Steve Kester to visit the Republican lawmaker sponsoring that state’s measure. “Apple is telling me this is a bad thing because you’re going to have a mecca for hackers in Nebraska,” State Sen. Lydia Brasch said of Kester’s February visit.  Apple hasn’t commented on the bills, but a trade group it belongs to contends the Nebraska measure would force the company to divulge how it secures sensitive data on the iPhone. “Think about how much of our personal lives are in this device,” said Mike Lanigan, head engineer for Apple’s service efforts. Lanigan said customers have been requesting repair service since shortly after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, but the company waited until it could perfect the process. “We view the service aspect of this as all part of the overall Apple experience,” Lanigan said. Apple doesn’t break out repair revenue in its financial statements. Analysts estimate it at $1 billion to $2 billion annually for all products.  As Apple’s screen mending has matured, its prices have dropped to $129 to $149, depending on screen size, from $229. That’s competitive with many independent shops for newer iPhones. Still, some technicians charge as little as $60 to fix older models.  Apple says its process aims to make the display look like it just came out of the box. To demonstrate, the company allowed Reuters to observe the Horizon Machine at a repair lab in Sunnyvale, California.  In the cavernous, brightly lit lab painted in Apple’s signature sparkling white, two lab technicians clad in T-shirts, shorts and tennis shoes scurried between rows of long white metal tables stuffed with test equipment. Dozens of Horizon Machines lined the tables. The contraptions, gray metal boxes the size of a microwave with a swing-out windowed door, vary slightly in shape depending on the model of iPhone they repair. Apple would not say where the machines were made or by whom. In a smaller training room, a technician laid out the tools Apple uses to fix iPhone screens: special screwdrivers for the iPhone’s five- and three-lobed screws, a custom suction-cup for loosening the screen without tearing the delicate ribbon cables behind it, and a press to squeeze iPhone 7s to ensure waterproofing. Once the new screen is mounted, the iPhone goes into the Horizon Machine, which allows Apple’s software to communicate with the fresh hardware. Over the course of 10 to 12 minutes, the machine talks to the phone’s operating system to pair the fingerprint sensor to the phone’s brain. While that unfolds, a mechanical finger jabs the screen in multiple places to test the touch-sensitive surface. The machine also fine tunes the display and software to match the precise colors and calibration of the original. “We design for a customer experience that exceeds anything our competitors try to do,” said Naumann, Apple’s service chief. “We endeavor to make it right at the same standard as when the customer bought the product.” "
"2017-08-24",2,"Apple said the project will generate more than 550 jobs in construction and operations, but did not specify how many of those jobs would be long-term positions. Speaking alongside Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the facility “will create hundreds of jobs for people in Iowa from construction to engineering.” Cook said Apple will contribute up to $100 million toward a “public improvement fund” for the city of Waukee, adding the first project supported by the fund will be a youth sports complex that “will be open to all.” The bulk of the subsidy is a planned $188.2 million property tax abatement of 71 percent over 20 years provided by the city of Waukee, according to economic development officials. Foxconn is a major Apple supplier, but is not expected to make any Apple products at its proposed U.S. plant. “This new data center will play a very important role in the App Store’s continued success,” Cook said. “As the App Store grows, we look forward to growing in Iowa.” Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp also maintain data centers in Iowa. Apple will spend $110 million to acquire and prepare the land for its data centers in Iowa, according to economic development officials.  The bulk of the costs, $620 million, will go toward construction. Apple will spend $600 million on computer equipment, with $45 million going toward other equipment. "
"2017-07-12",-1,"An Apple spokesman in Shanghai told Reuters the center is part of a planned $1 billion investment into the province.  “The addition of this data center will allow us to improve the speed and reliability of our products and services while also complying with newly passed regulations,” Apple said in a statement to Reuters. “These regulations require cloud services be operated by Chinese companies so we’re partnering with GCBD to offer iCloud,” it said, referring to its online data storage service. Apple is the first foreign firm to announce amendments to its data storage for China following the implementation of a new cyber-security law on June 1 that requires foreign firms to store data within the country. Overseas business groups said the law’s strict data surveillance and storage requirements are overly vague, burdening the firms with excessive compliance risks and threatening proprietary data. Apple also said it had strong data privacy and security protections in place. “No backdoors will be created into any of our systems,” it said. In April, China also announced a law requiring businesses transferring over 1,000 gigabytes of data outside China to undergo yearly security reviews, with potential blocks on exporting economic, technological and scientific data.  Earlier this week, Apple said it planned to open a new data center in Denmark. An earlier center in the country, announced in 2015, will come online this year, it said. The new laws come as Chinese cloud firms are expanding rapidly in foreign markets. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has 17 data centers across China, the United States, Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Other foreign firms that oversee cloud businesses, including Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, already have data centers in China. "

A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted.  Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe. “Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,” Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple. Asked if they had discussed France’s proposal to tax the revenue of big tech companies and not profit, the Macron adviser said: “They didn’t go into specifics.” “The tone was very open. This wasn’t a posturing competition.” Tech giants were under pressure from shareholders worried about reputational damage over how the companies arrange their taxes, the official added.  Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world’s most highly valued company.  “They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,”  said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. “Facial recognition is one of iPhone X’s differentiating features.”  Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.   Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA), one of Europe’s larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so.

"2017-06-16",2,"“Jamie and Zack are two of the most talented TV executives in the world and have been instrumental in making this the golden age of television,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “There is much more to come,” Cue said of Apple’s video effort. The new hires demonstrate a serious commitment by another deep-pocketed technology company to produce quality television shows. Erlicht and Van Amburg have served as senior Sony television executives since 2005. But Apple did not elaborate on its strategy, leaving investors guessing how many shows it plans to distribute, how much it will spend and where the programming will be available.  The company is playing in an increasingly competitive field. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have invested billions of dollars in award-winning comedies and dramas featuring A-list Hollywood stars. And social media company Facebook Inc (FB.O) has signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators, including Vox and BuzzFeed, to make shows for its upcoming video service. Apple began its move last week with reality program “Planet of the Apps,” an unscripted show about developers competing for venture capital funding. The series is available only to subscribers to Apple Music, a $10-a-month streaming service. As tech companies push further into the content business, pressure mounts on traditional media outlets that do not have the same amount of data on viewers or the ability for content to be a loss leader, said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG.  “These companies do not need to make money off video because they can make money other ways,” Greenfield said. “And they are going to have tons of data on their viewers.” “From a credit perspective, we’d much rather see Apple overpay to deliver original content than pay $50 billion to buy Netflix and basically compete for the same content,” he said. “They’ll definitely get a better bang for their buck by focusing on their Apple TV product.”  Greenfield said news of Apple’s hires should put to rest rumors that Apple might acquire another content company, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). “It’s pretty clear now that Apple isn’t buying Disney,” he said.  Disney shares were down 0.5 percent at $105.40 on Friday afternoon. Apple shares were down 0.9 percent at $143.01. For Sony, the departures come as the Japanese conglomerate revamps its movie and television studio under new Chief Executive Tony Vinciquerra. In a memo to staff, Vinciquerra suggested Apple could be a buyer of Sony programming.  “While we are sad to see them go, we are excited by the opportunity to work with them as partners in the future,” he said.

Cook said in May that Apple planned to create a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. companies that perform advanced manufacturing. He also said the company intended to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps. Apple came under fire from Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China. ""We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,"" Trump had said in a speech in January last year. (reut.rs/2tACzRk) Apple, on its part, had been making disclosures to highlight how it had been contributing to job creation in the United States. Cook said in February that Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its U.S. suppliers. The world’s largest company by market valuation had also claimed that it created 2 million jobs in the United States, 80,000 of which are directly at Apple and the rest coming from suppliers and developers for the company’s app ecosystem. Trump’s comments on Tuesday were some of the first he has made regarding Apple’s manufacturing since assuming the presidency. “I said you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won’t consider my administration an economic success,” the Journal quoted Trump as saying.      Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump also said that Foxconn (2317.TW), a major Apple supplier, plans to build a big plant in the United States and is “strongly considering” putting it in Wisconsin, the Journal reported. Foxconn said last month it plans to invest more than $10 billion in a display-making factory in the United States.   "
"2017-08-16",-1,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ireland’s finance minister said the European Commission’s demand that Dublin retroactively collect 13 billion euros in taxes from Apple was unjustified and not Dublin’s job, in an interview with Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) newspaper. In the interview, extracts from which the FAZ published on Wednesday, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the tax rules from which Apple benefited had been available to all and not tailored for the U.S. technology giant. They did not violate European or Irish law, he added. “We are not the global tax collector for everybody else,” the paper quoted him as saying. The European Commission last year ruled that Apple paid so little tax on its Ireland-based operations that it amounted to state aid and ordered it to pay back up to 13 million euros in tax to Dublin. The Irish government has said it will collect the money pending an appeal by Apple. (Reporting By Thomas Escritt, Editing by Michelle Martin)"
"2017-03-09",-6,"But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States.  Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai.  The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries.  “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that.  “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” (Story corrects “language model” in paragraph 10 to “acoustic model”.)

Shareholders at the meeting at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California defeated a proxy proposal that would have let them nominate two directors on the company’s board. The proposal won 31.9 percent of votes.  Shareholders also defeated a proposal to require Apple executives to retain their shares until they retire. That vote won 24.2-percent support.

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland. “We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said. According to the August 2016 decision issued by the EU, Apple met with the European Commission in 2015 to explain its new corporate structure as well as submitting a summary with the key elements as a follow-up. Vestager also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any general investigations. “That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.” The Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple. “We have no indication when it comes to the time perspective of Apple’s recovery.

"2017-09-13",-4,"The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in “Dick Tracy,” the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys.  “This has been our vision from the beginning,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event.  “Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected. It’s really nice to know you can be reached if needed.” To be sure, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014, but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power. They also require a separate phone number.  Apple claims its new Series 3, on the other hand, will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2. And it will have the same phone number as a customer’s iPhone, which will still be required for the initial set up of the watch. Apple said that all four major U.S. carriers will offer service for the watch, and AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra $10 a month. At $399, the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model, the $329 Series 2, which introduced standalone GPS capability. That $70 extra buys much more useful capabilities - including the ability to stream music from Apple Music.  “The third time is the charm for the watch,” said Bob O‘Donnell of Techanalysis Research. Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018. Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump, to 26 million units in 2018. Either way, Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals such as Fitbit Inc and Garmin Ltd, which would be hard-pressed from a technical and business standpoint  to match Apple’s wireless features.  But the new Apple Watch still requires an iPhone, which Fitbit believes leaves it ample market room to sell wearable devices that work with all phones, not just iPhones. “With Android comprising approximately 80 percent of the global smartphone market, broad compatibility remains a core differentiator for Fitbit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. Garmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours. The Watch will remain a blip in Apple’s sales, which were $215 billion last year. But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without - all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses. "
"2017-06-13",0,"Apple said its second green bond is meant to show that businesses are still committed to the goals of the 194-nation accord. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change and protect our shared planet,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. The tech giant said proceeds from the green bond sales will be used to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency at Apple facilities and in its supply chain and procuring safer materials for its products.  The offering also includes a specific focus on helping Apple meet a goal of greening its supply chain and using only renewable resources or recycled material, reducing its need to mine rare earth materials.  Last year, Apple allocated $442 million to 16 different projects from renewable energy to recycling from its first bond offer. One of the projects it funded was a robotic system called Liam to take apart junked iPhones and recover valuable materials that can be recycled, such as silver and tungsten - an attempt to address criticism that Apple’s products, while sleek and seamless in design, are so tightly constructed that their components can be difficult to take apart.  Although green bonds comprise a small fraction of the overall bond market, demand has grown significantly as investors seek lower-carbon investments. In 2016, $81 billion of green bonds were issued, double the number from 2015, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an organization that promotes the use of green bonds. Governments are also embracing the use of green bonds as a way to meet a 2015 pledge by world leaders to limit global warming this century to below 2 degrees Celsius. "

The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said.    An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.  Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N).

Electronic marketplaces like the App Store, ticket site StubHub, Amazon’s (AMZN.O) Marketplace and eBay (EBAY.O) where individual sellers set prices rather than the marketplace itself potentially could be sued by consumers. The antitrust claims date back to a 2011 lawsuit filed by several iPhone buyers in California federal court, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, according to court papers. They allege that Cupertino, California-based Apple has monopolized the sale of apps like messaging programs and games, leading to inflated prices. The company has sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, saying the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the case because they are not charged the commission. The plaintiffs countered that they, not the developers, pay Apple for apps at prices that include the commission, which they called a “monopolistic surcharge.” The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January sided with the plaintiffs, ruling that because consumers directly bought products from Apple they were entitled to sue.

The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Silicon Valley has closely followed the 6-1/2-year-old case. Companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have said an Apple win would encourage owners of design patents to sue for huge, unfair awards on products containing hundreds of features that are costly to develop. The $399 million represented profit from Samsung’s sales of infringing smartphones, though the South Korean company has said it deserved reimbursement if it prevailed in the litigation. It was part of a $548 million payment that Samsung made to Apple in December 2015. The legal dispute concerned whether the “article of manufacture” for which Samsung owed damages included its entire smartphones, or only parts that infringed Apple patents. Without deciding that question, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court last Dec. 6 that “the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product.” In Sunday’s order, Koh said the jury instructions at the original 2012 trial inaccurately stated the law on that issue. She said Samsung may have been prejudiced if jurors were prevented from considering whether any infringement covered “something other than the entire phone.” Apple contended that the jury instructions were “not erroneous,” and said it had proved that Samsung applied its patented designs to its “entire phones.” Jurors initially awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced. Samsung, in a statement, welcomed a new trial, calling it “a historic opportunity to determine how the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance on design patent damages will be implemented.” The case is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-01846.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid. “I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organised, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager said on the sidelines of the Web Summit, one of the world’s biggest conferences on the future of the internet. “We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said in the Portuguese capital Lisbon.

Ofo and its main rival Mobike are among a growing number of bike-sharing services that have sprung up in China that allow users to find, unlock and pay to rent trackable bicycles through smartphone apps. It targets younger consumers seeking to get around congested roads and public transport. Ofo says it operates in 43 cities in China with 2.2 million bikes. It also claims pilot schemes in Singapore, London and California. Shanghai-based Mobike, which has raised more than $300 million so far this year from investors including Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), Warburg Pincus, and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, said on Tuesday it was fully launching in Singapore.

"2017-05-04",1,"Apple is already the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, and its weight within the S&P 500 in recent decades has been rivaled only by Exxon Mobil and Microsoft.  The iPhone maker’s market capitalization recently reached a record $774 billion after increasing 27 percent so far in 2017. If Apple continues to grow at that rate, its market capitalization will hit $1 trillion in October. “Investors see the big numbers, the hoopla surrounding hitting one of these arbitrary levels...” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Hitting those milestones often attracts more investors,” she added. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 percent of the S&P 500 in September 2012, but its share of the index has since slipped to 3.8 percent. In comparison, Exxon Mobil accounted for 5.3 percent of the S&P 500 in December 2008, while Microsoft briefly accounted for 4.9 percent of the index in 2000.  Apple recently accounted for 15.1 percent of the S&P 500 technology index, down from a peak of 21.8 percent in 2012. The technology index recently traded at 17.4 times expected earnings, down a little from a month ago but otherwise near highs not seen since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  Shares of Apple edged down 0.3 percent on Wednesday after the company reported its March-quarter results on Tuesday and said sales of iPhones fell, surprising investors.  Still, at least four analysts raised their share price target for Apple.   While global smartphone sales have lost steam in recent years, investors remain optimistic that Apple will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with new models that give a major boost to sales.   The median analyst 12-month price target for Apple on Wednesday was $160. Hitting that target implies a 9 percent rise from current levels, which would put Apple’s market capitalization at $836 billion, excluding the effect of potential stock buybacks. Still, analyst price targets are a poor predictor of stock performance, and a stock’s past performance often says little about what it will do in the future. In February, Warren Buffett told CNBC that Apple was likely to hit a $1 trillion market value before his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $410 billion after its stock rose 2 percent so far in 2017.  Steep stock gains driven by optimism about upcoming iPhones are unlikely to continue at the same pace, said Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities. But he recommends the stock and even increased his own price target to $160 from $155 following Apple’s quarterly report.  “It’s a value play that should be bought at current levels,” Seyrafi said.

"2017-11-02",3,"With supplies potentially tight, some Australian purchasers were already planning to sell their phones for as much as A$3,000, nearly double the A$1,579 selling price. Apple shares rose 4 percent in after-hours trading to hit an all-time high, with analysts lavishing praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook and speculating on when Apple might become the first public company worth a trillion dollars. The earnings demonstrate how Apple is able to drive growth across an ever-expanding product line that now includes five different iPhone models along with the iPad, the Mac, the Apple Watch and a suite of fast-growing services offerings. “We had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones,” Cook said on a call with analysts. “We tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone, but may have a more limited budget.” Just a few weeks ago, Apple appeared to be facing a rare stumble with a delay in the iPhone X launch and rumors of production problems that could limit supply. But Apple executives on Thursday shrugged off the concerns as Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the company was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing. Analysts have been eager to see whether Apple can meet demand for the iPhone X during the crucial holiday quarter, with most saying it will likely take it until next year or early spring to do so. “Where the demand curve and supply curve are going to intersect, we do not know. It does not have a predecessor product,” Maestri told Reuters.  The Cupertino, California-based company’s market capitalization of about $868 billion already makes it the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company. There are still questions around supplies of the new phone and longer-term demand.  Bob O‘Donnell, head of Techanalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple is not able to fill demand for iPhone X over the holiday quarter, it would push buyers to wait until Apple’s March quarter, by which time they may have spent their money elsewhere. Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts’ estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. However, average selling prices of $618 fell short of forecasts of $638. The company’s net income rose to $10.71 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the quarter, from $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. That beat the average analyst estimate of $1.87 per share. Apple forecast a gross margin of 38 percent to 38.5 percent, higher than many analysts expected because new products often have higher costs. Maestri attributed the margin strength to Apple’s growing services business, which brought in $8.5 billion in revenue compared to analyst estimates of $7.5 billion. That included a favorable $640 million adjustment, though Apple officials did not elaborate. The $28.85 billion revenue from iPhone sales accounted for nearly 55 percent of total revenue, which rose 12.2 percent to $52.58 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $50.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple also said it returned to revenue growth in China, bringing in $9.8 billion compared with $8 billion a year ago, driven by double-digit unit sale increases of the iPhone. Maestri also told Reuters the company had doubled its revenue in India during the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not give any details. "

"2017-09-13",-3,"CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out its much-anticipated iPhone X, a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Chief Executive Tim Cook called “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.” The launch contained few surprises, with leaked details on the phone and other products including an updated Apple Watch proving largely accurate. But the iPhone X’s $999 price still raised eyebrows, and its Nov. 3 ship date prompted questions about possible supply constraints ahead of the holiday season. Investors and fans have viewed the 10th-anniversary iPhone launch as an opportunity for Apple to refresh a smartphone lineup that had lagged the competition in new features. Last year the company’s revenue declined when many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. The new Apple Watch for the first time will be able to make calls and access the internet without the customer carrying an iPhone -- a major upgrade that one analyst predicted would more than double watch sales.  The iPhone X has wireless charging, an infrared camera and hardware for facial recognition, which replaces the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone. The home button is also gone, and users instead tap the device to wake it up. Apple normally ships new products within a week or two of announcing them, though the company said the later date was consistent with earlier guidance to investors. “It’s great to have a product but we’d have liked it sooner rather than later, more like the beginning of October or mid- October,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Apple shares closed down 0.4 percent. They had traded as much as 1 percent higher during the launch event before reversing course. The shares are up almost 40 percent on the year. Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, said he was not worried about the ship date and liked the new phones features, but also flagged a lack of surprises. “It’s sell on the news,” he said. “They didn’t talk about the evolution of Apple beyond the iPhone and into artificial intelligence.” The screen on the iPhone X is about the size of the current iPhone 7 plus, though the phone is smaller. It features richer colors thanks to a new screen technology called OLED that other vendors are also rolling out.  But in an embarrassing moment for Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, the face ID unlocking did not work on his first attempt during the on-stage presentation. Wireless carriers in the United States, whose fierce battle for customers could tempt them into renewing the practice of subsidizing phones, immediately began to offer discounts. T-Mobile US Inc said customers on a payment plan can trade in their iPhone 6 or newer and receive up to $300 off over 24 months.  AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, the dominant mobile carriers in the United States, have not yet disclosed their pricing plans. Apple also introduced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which resemble the iPhone 7 line but have a glass back for wireless charging. The company said it was working on a new device, called the AirPower, that would charge all newer Apple products.  The wireless charging uses a standard called Qi, also used by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which will likely solidify that technology as the industry standard.  The new phones all feature Apple’s first proprietary graphics processor, which provides greater speed, improved cameras and some features for augmented reality apps.  The company had previously used graphics chips from Imagination Technologies Group Plc, which put itself up for sale earlier this year after Apple said it would make its own technology.   The cheapest of the iPhone 8 models have 64 gigabytes of memory, up from 32 gigabytes in previous models, and will sell for $699 and $799. Apple also noted that for budget-conscious shoppers, there is now a $349 iPhone SE, similar to the iPhone 5.  The bump-up in memory for the new phones should help suppliers of memory chips, and Apple is now angling to own a piece of the memory-chip business being sold by Toshiba Corp The new Series 3 watch will cost $399 and support a range of third-party apps. Apple has never released numbers on watch sales, but analyst Gene Munster with Loup Ventures forecast the company would sell 26 million in 2018. Also featured at the launch event was an upgraded Apple TV that will support the high-resolution display known as 4K and will feature more programming options as Apple steps up efforts to cut content deals and produce its own shows.

"2017-04-11",-7,"* Broker estimates Apple accounts for 70 pct of Dialog sales * Other suppliers under scrutiny on Apple in-sourcing risks * Dialog shares fall as much as a third to seven-month low (Adds additional analyst comment; other stock impacts) By Eric Auchard and Harro Ten Wolde FRANKFURT, April 11 (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor risks losing a crucial supply deal with Apple Inc , according to a financial analyst who cut his rating on the stock on Tuesday, sending the Anglo-German chipmaker’s shares down by as much as one-third. Bankhaus Lampe reduced its rating on Dialog to “sell” from “hold” as it argued that Apple was working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone that could replace Dialog’s power management integrated circuits (PMIC) as early as 2019. Apple accounted for more than 70 percent of Dialog’s 2016 sales, analysts estimate. The German company says it is the world’s top maker of power management chips used in smartphones with roughly 20 percent of the market. Shares in Dialog fell as much as 36 percent on Tuesday to a seven-month low. They had more than doubled in the second half of 2016 on rising expectations for the iPhone 8 due out later in 2017. By 1052 GMT, they had pared losses by half to trade down 19 percent at 37.70 euros ($38.87). Apple’s suppliers are in the spotlight after Imagination Technologies last week revealed Apple’s plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house, sending shudders through Apple’s global supply chain. Imagination’s stock plunged 70 percent. Bankhaus Lampe cited unnamed industry sources as saying that Apple was setting up power management design centres both in Munich and California and said Apple already had around 80 engineers working on a power management chip of its own. “In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen said, referring to power management chips. Lampe’s Iltgen is a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Dialog and ranks sixth among 16 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Apple was recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich. “They are poaching like crazy,” the person said. A Dialog spokesman declined to comment. He also said Dialog was not planning any official statement. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request to comment. A trader with brokerage Exane, who said he had been in contact with Dialog management, said investors were overreacting to speculation that Dialog might lose Apple’s business. He said Dialog has completed designs for chips that Apple plans to use in 2017 and 2018 iPhone models while it continues to discuss with Apple using its parts in 2019 phones. The trader also said Apple would need to hire more than 1,000 engineers to completely replace the power management chips supplied by Dialog. Dialog has made several attempts to diversify beyond Apple and other smartphone customers in the past few years. In 2014, merger talks between Dialog and Austrian sensor chip maker Ams AG fell apart after they failed to come to terms. Its plans to buy U.S.-based Atmel in 2015 were derailed after Microchip swooped in with a higher bid. Apple has outsourced production of its hardware products to an extended network of suppliers, large and small, while it has moved over the past decade to design its own central processors and added functions like fingerprint recognition since then. Over the past dozen years, Apple suppliers CSR, PortalPlayer, Sigmatel and Wolfson have been replaced, pushing them eventually to merge with more diversified players. But Apple continues to rely on key suppliers to develop innovations ranging from image and motion sensors to power management. Other chip suppliers for the current iPhone 7 include, but are not limited to, Cirrus Logic, NXP, Qualcomm, Skyworks, STMicroelectronics , according to an analysis by TechInsights in September. Shares in highly diversified chipmaker STMicro, which analysts believe supplies light sensors for iPhones, fell 2.5 percent, weighing on the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 Technology index, which was down 1 percent.

"2017-03-09",-6,"By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO, March 9 (Reuters) - With the broad release of Google Assistant last week, the voice-assistant wars are in full swing, with Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and now Alphabet Inc’s Google all offering electronic assistants to take your commands. Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” "
"2017-06-26",0,"“The thinking we share here is that if your enterprise or company is using Cisco and Apple, the combination of these should make that (cyber-security) insurance cost significantly less,” Cook said. “This is something we’re going to spend some energy on. You should reap that benefit.” Cisco gave few details about the effort, saying in a company blog post the two companies were “collaborating with insurance industry heavyweights ... to offer more robust policies to our customers.” Cisco, a networking company that has increasingly moved into cyber security in recent years, highlighted several other joint efforts with Apple. It rolled out a new security app for iPhones meant to protect against so-called phishing attacks - an email with a malicious link sent under the guise of being legitimate. Cook also said the “fast lane” that Cisco had created in 2015 to speed up Internet connections for iPhones on Cisco routers and switches has been expanded to Mac computers. Long known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in revenue selling to businesses. Apple has also undertaken joint efforts with enterprise software firms IBM (IBM.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) to encourage developers to write business apps for its mobile devices. "
"2017-03-01",-18,"The trial judge vacated the large damages award a few months after a Texas federal jury imposed it in February 2015, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Wednesday the judge should have ruled Smartflash’s patents invalid and set aside the verdict entirely. A unanimous three-judge appeals panel said Smartflash’s patents were too “abstract” and did not go far enough in describing an actual invention to warrant protection. The decision likely ends a case that had attracted wide attention when the verdict was rendered but had gone against the  plaintiff ever since. Neither Smartflash nor Apple could be immediately reached for comment. Smartflash was founded in 2000 by inventor Patrick Racz, who obtained several patents on a system for storing data like songs, videos and games and accessing that data through electronic payments systems. Racz was unable to commercialize the technology and Smartflash sells no products of its own. The company sued Apple in May 2013. Smartflash’s complaint alleged that Racz has discussed his ideas in 2000 with a technologist who later became a senior director at Apple. Smartflash filed its lawsuit against Apple in the Eastern District of Texas, a venue popular with patent owners. Smartflash also brought a similar case in the same court against Samsung Electronics Co, which remains pending. It later filed additional cases against Google and Amazon . U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap refused to set aside the jury’s findings that Apple infringed Smartflash’s patents, but he ordered a retrial on damages, saying he did not properly instruct the jury on the question of how much to award. Apple appealed to the Federal Circuit, which is designated to hear patent cases. The tech giant also joined Samsung in challenging the validity of Smartflash’s patents before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which invalidated as too abstract the three Smartflash patents the jury found Apple infringed. Smartflash appealed that ruling to the Federal Circuit, which could have ended the case by affirming the patent office’s determination. It instead ended the case by ruling Gilstrap should have found Smartflash’s patents invalid himself."

"2017-04-28",-7,"Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and others also filed comments suggesting changes. California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts. In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system “disengagements.” California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons. But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and “caused public confusion and misunderstanding,” wrote Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity. Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present. The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco. Apple also said the state’s rules for development vehicles used only in testing could “restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles.” A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday. ‘STIFLE INNOVATION’ Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could “stifle innovation,” and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September.  Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: “There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback.”  Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing. Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co (GM.N) had said the state’s proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped. Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars. A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21. "

"2017-11-03",7,"Apple’s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world’s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.  “I can’t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,” said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block. Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.  “I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”  The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States. The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone. Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.  In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district. “I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night. In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7. In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.  “I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue. In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.   Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased. But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing. “Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said. Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks. The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.  Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion. Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles. “We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.

"2017-09-13",-1,"By Stephen Nellis CUPERTINO, Calif., Sept 12 (Reuters) - More than two years after releasing the Apple Watch, Apple Inc has finally been able to replicate 1940s comic strip technology, an advance that analysts say will spur sales. The Series 3 of the Apple Watch, released on Tuesday along with the much-anticipated iPhone X, features wireless LTE connectivity. That means customers will be able to make phone calls or send text messages from the watch without needing to have an iPhone nearby, as they do with earlier models. The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in “Dick Tracy,” the comic about a private detective who, starting in 1946, used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys. “This has been our vision from the beginning,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event. “Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected. It’s really nice to know you can be reached if needed.” To be sure, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014, but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power. They also require a separate phone number. Apple claims its new Series 3, on the other hand, will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2. And it will have the same phone number as a customer’s iPhone, which will still be required for the initial set up of the watch. Apple said that all four major U.S. carriers will offer service for the watch, and AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra $10 a month. Analysts generally believe the new connectivity could ignite sales, though there is little consensus as to how much. At $399, the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model, the $329 Series 2, which introduced standalone GPS capability. That $70 extra buys much more useful capabilities - including the ability to stream music from Apple Music. “The third time is the charm for the watch,” said Bob O‘Donnell of Techanalysis Research. What may hold some consumers back is the monthly recurring charge, which would far exceed the extra cost of the Series 3 over older watches over time, said Brian Blau, an Apple analyst with Gartner. “Yes, you do have to pay for that extra data plan, but it sounds like the carriers are at least going to make it relatively easy to do,” Blau said. Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018. Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump, to 26 million units in 2018. Either way, Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals such as Fitbit Inc and Garmin Ltd, which would be hard-pressed from a technical and business standpoint to match Apple’s wireless features. But the new Apple Watch still requires an iPhone, which Fitbit believes leaves it ample market room to sell wearable devices that work with all phones, not just iPhones. “With Android comprising approximately 80 percent of the global smartphone market, broad compatibility remains a core differentiator for Fitbit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. Garmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours. The Watch will remain a blip in Apple’s sales, which were $215 billion last year. But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without - all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses. "

"2017-04-28",-7,"Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and others also filed comments suggesting changes. California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts. In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system “disengagements.” California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons. But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and “caused public confusion and misunderstanding,” wrote Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity. Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present. The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco. Apple also said the state’s rules for development vehicles used only in testing could “restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles.” A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday. ‘STIFLE INNOVATION’ Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could “stifle innovation,” and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September.  Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: “There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback.”  Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing. Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co (GM.N) had said the state’s proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped. Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars. A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21. "
"2017-09-29",1,"* Buyback deal on iPhone 8, 8 plus and iPhone X * Deal to give Apple access to Reliance, Jio retail stores in 900 cities * Reliance targeting 500 mln customers with its low-cost JioPhone By Sankalp Phartiyal and Promit Mukherjee NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - India’s Reliance said on Friday that customers of its Jio telecoms unit who buy the latest Apple iPhone models from partner stores could sell them back in a year at a guaranteed price, a move that could help the U.S. tech firm expand in India. The offer, which comes during the Indian festive season when discretionary spending typically rises, assures customers buying iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X models through Jio that they will get back 70 percent of the cost after a year of use. Apart from possibly lifting Apple sales in India, the move could also draw more high-paying customers to the Jio network. Cupertino, California-based Apple is keen to sell more iPhones in India, one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets, but the high cost of its handsets has kept higher-end iPhones in particular out of the reach of hundreds of millions of Indians. The deal with Reliance, an oil-to-telecoms conglomerate, is Apple’s latest attempt to grow in India’s competitive smartphone market, similar to the way it boosted sales in countries like the United States by partnering with network operators to subsidise the cost of the phone. At 64,000 rupees ($980) the upfront cost of the iPhone 8 is still high however, and some remain sceptical that a buyback offer will do much to boost Apple’s market share in India where iPhone users can already easily resell old iPhones for 50 to 60 percent of their cost in the second-hand market. “Older and more affordable iPhones will still make for a bulk of Apple’s sales in India,” said Tarun Pathak, analyst at tech research firm Counterpoint. “People want their phones but not necessarily the latest and the most expensive ones.” This is the first time such a hefty buyback offer has been made for an iPhone in India, Akash Ambani, the son of India’s richest man, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani, said in Mumbai on Friday when unveiling the deal. “We’re excited to be building so many new relationships in India,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a brief pre-recorded video. For Apple, growing in India is crucial as growth slows at home and in China. The deal will place Apple’s iPhones in Reliance and Jio retail stores in 900 cities across India, giving the company a chance to boost its meagre 3 percent market share and close the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics . The offer, which will likely boost Reliance’s average revenue per user, will be available to Jio customers who buy the iPhone and subscribe to its 799 rupees ($12.22) monthly package for 12 months. By comparison, the industry’s monthly average revenue per user was just 80 rupees in the quarter ended-June, according to recent regulatory data. While there is no penalty for downgrading to a cheaper plan or leaving the contract mid-way through, customers who do so will lose out on the buyback offer. This is unlike contract deals in some Western countries where the total cost of a phone is subsidised and there is a penalty for dropping contracts mid-way. With the Apple deal at the high end of the spectrum, Jio is also working to woo cost-conscious aspirational smartphone buyers at the lower end with a $23 4G phone that blurs the line between a smartphone and a traditional feature phone. The company, which has signed on 128 million users in less than a year via cut-price deals, is now eyeing between 250-300 million customers in the next two years, a source has told Reuters.

"2017-03-09",-6,"But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States.  Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai.  The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries.  “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that.  “Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants,” said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” (Story corrects “language model” in paragraph 10 to “acoustic model”.)

"2017-05-23",-4,"Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia’s digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France’s Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. “There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel,” said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an “accumulate” recommendation for Nokia shares.  “I have not given any value so far for Nokia’s digital health business, but might apply an option value to it.”  “(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centers,” he said. “It’s a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it.” Under the patent license agreement, Nokia will receive a “significant” upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. “It’s interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure,” said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents.  In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. “(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners,” Nokia’s Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. “Nokia told analysts in April don’t calculate on any license revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia’s legal expenses,” said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. “For Nokia, it’s good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact,” said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. “The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros.” Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company’s patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia’s total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros. "
"2017-03-06",2,"“Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do,” said Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He said Berkshire’s Apple stake, currently at about 133 million shares, was worth about $18 billion based on Friday’s closing price and amounted to Berkshire’s second-biggest holding. At the end of Dec. 31, Berkshire had held 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion, according to regulatory filings. Buffett said his ambitious move into Apple shares was piggybacking on the initial investment made by Buffett’s deputy investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a “terrific job,” Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company’s earnings report.  Buffett, 86, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading.  Buffett said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market.  He said U.S. shares could conceivably “go down 20 percent tomorrow.” Buffett said Berkshire’s positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a “very tough game” and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes.  Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends.  Despite his disagreement with some of Trump’s policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made “a lot of sense.”  On Kraft Heinz’s snubbed bid for Unilever, Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a “backup deal.” Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. “Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there’s no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal.” Asked about Berkshire’s $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was “always looking” for acquisitions but that there was “nothing close.” Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: “It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond” and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent.  Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry’s standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains “borders on obscene.” In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.” Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire “missed big time” by not purchasing Amazon shares early on.  He said the U.S. economy was doing “terrific,” even at just 2 percent growth per year.  "

"2017-01-27",3,"Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use.     The strategic importance of the “connected home” niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary.      Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone.  Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns.     “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets.  Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn’t disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple’s Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple’s approach. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products.  “They’re a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they’re not [Apple] certified,” said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren’t allowed to say publicly that they’re pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it’s worth it. “They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn’t find in our testing,” said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. “We know that after we have the certification that it’s rock solid.” AMAZON‘S “OPEN” APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the “Works with Alexa” label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple’s approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa.       Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app.      Apple’s ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S.  “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can’t guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN.     Still, it’s not clear whether Apple’s elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon’s widening lead.  “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that’s certain yet.” "

"2017-04-14",0,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault April 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, which allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, President of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former Vice President at Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The permit does not necessarily mean Apple is building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement when the company submitted its comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration late last year. After a five-page letter last November from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to NHTSA, the company was under increased speculation that they would enter into the competitive self-driving space. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. At that time Apple said it had provided comments to NHTSA “because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to bring self-driving cars to the masses. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.

The holding was valued at more than $8.3 billion as of Friday’s $136.66 closing price. Berkshire became one of the top 10 Apple investors in 2016, taking a stake of more than 9 million shares in the first quarter and then accelerating purchases in the last three months of the year.

"2017-01-31",3,"Moreover, innovation is slowing. A faster processor, water resistance and better camera provided many users with reasons to upgrade to the company’s latest handset, but these pale in comparison with the improvements of a few years ago. Apple is spending more money in R&D and cramming more expensive features into phones, but receiving less benefit. That’s why despite record revenue and iPhone sales, income fell about 3 percent compared to the same period last year. To compensate, Apple is tapping the iPhone in other ways. It’s selling more services such as apps in its store, online data storage, streaming music and payments. They now account for 9 percent of revenue, a line the company hopes to double over the next four years. It’s also selling more related items, such as its new wireless headphones. And Apple is trying to pinch suppliers. The company is suing wireless chip company Qualcomm to recoup $1 billion in rebates it claims it is owed, and slash the $15 – according to Sanford Bernstein – in royalties it pays on each iPhone sold. The muted prospects explain why investors value Apple at just 13.5 times estimated 2017 earnings – 25 percent below the S&P 500 average. That may be too steep a discount. Services will continue to grow. The company’s cash pile has swelled to nearly $250 billion and investors would benefit from any reduction in taxes on repatriated funds. And the average customers’ phone is getting older. Should Apple’s next phone dazzle later this year, the result could be surprising growth."
"2017-02-23",-3,"Apple’s relatively slow adoption of new features both reflects and reinforces the fact smartphone customers are holding onto their phones longer. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen & Co, believes upwards of 40 percent of iPhones on the market are more than two years old, a historical high. That is a big reason why investors have driven Apple shares to an all-time high. There is pent-up demand for a new iPhone, even if it does not offer breakthrough technologies. It is not clear whether Apple deliberately held off on packing some of the new features into the current iPhone 7, which has been criticized for a lack of differentiation from its predecessor. Apple declined to comment on the upcoming product. Still, the development and roll-out of the anniversary iPhone suggest Apple’s product strategy is driven less by technological innovation than by consumer upgrade cycles and Apple’s own business and marketing needs. “When a market gets saturated, the growth is all about refresh,” said Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research. “This is exactly what happened to PCs. It’s exactly what happened to tablets. It’s starting to happen to smartphones.” Apple is close-mouthed about upcoming product features, but analysts and reports from Asian component suppliers and others indicate that high-resolution displays based on OLED technology -- possibly with curved edges -- are likely to be part of the anniversary phone. A radical new design is not expected, according to analysts. Some of the anticipated new technologies, notably wireless charging, remain messy. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) phones, for example, feature wireless charging but support two different sets of standards, one called Qi and the other AirFuel. As to 3-D sensors, there is already one hiding in the iPhone 7. The front camera features what is known as a time-of-flight sensor, which helps it autofocus and is used in numerous phones including the Blackberry, according to TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside tech devices. That sensor could be upgraded to a higher-resolution version that could handle 3-D mapping for facial recognition, said Jim Morrison, vice president at TechInsights. Apple will likely make a heavy marketing push around the phone’s 10th anniversary. “IPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement Jan. 8, the date the iPhone was announced by then-CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In 2015, the last year it disclosed the figure, Apple spent $1.8 billion on advertising, up 50 percent from the year before and nearly four times the $467 million it spent in 2007 when it first released the iPhone. And the company continues to excel at selling higher-priced phones. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri attributed the most recent quarter’s record-setting 78.3 million iPhones sold to the iPhone 7 Plus, which for the first time included a new dual camera feature not found in other models.  The iPhone 7 Plus tops out at $969 with memory upgrades and a jet black finish. O‘Donnell of Technalysis Research believes that with the next iPhone, Apple might even introduce a $1,000-plus “ultra-premium device for the real Apple-crazed folks out there who want to stand out.” "

"2017-08-16",-2,"In the interview, extracts from which the FAZ published on Wednesday, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the tax rules from which Apple benefited had been available to all and were not tailored for the U.S. technology giant.

The Irish government has said it will collect the money pending an appeal of the ruling by Apple, but Donohoe said it was not Dublin’s job and the request was not justified.  “We are not the global tax collector for everybody else,” FAZ quoted him as saying.  The money is currently being deposited in escrow. Donohoe also distanced himself from French and German proposals that the EU do more to prevent Chinese investors from buying strategically important European companies, saying this would endanger Europe’s reputation for openness. “We must be very careful not to endanger our reputation as advocates for free trade,” he said. He also appeared lukewarm on proposals by French President Emmanuel Macron for a euro zone budget and finance minister, saying the bloc’s focus for the next two years should be further developing its banking union.

"2017-04-11",-1,"Apple accounted for more than 70 percent of Dialog’s 2016 sales, analysts estimate. The German company says it is the world’s top maker of power management chips used in smartphones with roughly 20 percent of the market. Shares in Dialog fell as much as 36 percent on Tuesday to a seven-month low. They had more than doubled in the second half of 2016 on rising expectations for the iPhone 8 due out later in 2017.  Dialog said it saw no business reason for the share drop and that it remained comfortable with its financial outlook for “good revenue growth” in 2017, which would mark a recovery from a 12-percent decline last year. “The company notes the level of visibility into the design cycle of its leading customers remains unchanged and the business relationships are in line with the normal course of business,” it said in a statement. By 1340 GMT, the Dialog shares had pared losses and were 15 percent lower at 40.49 euros ($42.97). Apple’s suppliers are in the spotlight after Imagination Technologies IMG.L last week revealed Apple’s plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house, sending shudders through Apple’s global supply chain.  Imagination’s stock plunged 70 percent. Bankhaus Lampe cited unnamed industry sources as saying that Apple was setting up power management design centers both in Munich and California and said Apple already had around 80 engineers working on a power management chip of its own. “In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen said, referring to power management chips. Lampe’s Iltgen is a four-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Dialog and ranks sixth among 16 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Apple was recruiting top Dialog engineers in Munich. “They are poaching like crazy,” the person said. Apple declines to comment on matters involving its supplier relationships and did not respond to a request for comment for this story. A trader with brokerage Exane, who said he had been in contact with Dialog management, said investors were overreacting to speculation that Dialog might lose Apple’s business. He said Dialog has completed designs for chips that Apple plans to use in 2017 and 2018 iPhone models while it continues to discuss with Apple using its parts in 2019 phones. The trader also said Apple would need to hire more than 1,000 engineers to completely replace the power management chips supplied by Dialog. Dialog has made several attempts to diversify beyond Apple and other smartphone customers in the past few years.  In 2014, merger talks between Dialog and Austrian sensor chip maker Ams AG (AMS.S) fell apart after they failed to come to terms. Its plans to buy U.S.-based Atmel in 2015 were derailed after Microchip (MCHP.O) swooped in with a higher bid. Apple has outsourced production of its hardware products to an extended network of suppliers, large and small, while it has moved over the past decade to design its own central processors and added functions like fingerprint recognition since then. Over the past dozen years, Apple suppliers CSR, PortalPlayer, Sigmatel and Wolfson have been replaced, pushing them eventually to merge with more diversified players. But Apple still relies on key suppliers to develop innovations ranging from image and motion sensors to power management.  Other chip suppliers for the current iPhone 7 include, but are not limited to, Cirrus Logic (CRUS.O), NXP (NXPI.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Skyworks (SWKS.O), STMicroelectronics (STM.PA), according to an analysis by TechInsights in September. Shares in highly diversified chipmaker STMicro, which analysts believe supplies light sensors for iPhones, fell 3.6 percent, weighing on the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 Technology .SX8P index, which was down 1.5 percent.

It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia’s other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India’s smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India’s smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com’s India site for 28,433 rupees ($424). "

Still, the development and roll-out of the anniversary iPhone suggest Apple’s product strategy is driven less by technological innovation than by consumer upgrade cycles and Apple’s own business and marketing needs. “When a market gets saturated, the growth is all about refresh,” said Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research. “This is exactly what happened to PCs. It’s exactly what happened to tablets. It’s starting to happen to smartphones.” Apple is close-mouthed about upcoming product features, but analysts and reports from Asian component suppliers and others indicate that high-resolution displays based on OLED technology -- possibly with curved edges -- are likely to be part of the anniversary phone. A radical new design is not expected, according to analysts. Some of the anticipated new technologies, notably wireless charging, remain messy. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd phones, for example, feature wireless charging but support two different sets of standards, one called Qi and the other AirFuel. Apple recently joined the group backing Qi. But there are still at least five different groups working on wireless charging technology within Apple, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. As to 3-D sensors, there is already one hiding in the iPhone 7. The front camera features what is known as a time-of-flight sensor, which helps it autofocus and is used in numerous phones including the Blackberry, according to TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside tech devices. That sensor could be upgraded to a higher-resolution version that could handle 3-D mapping for facial recognition, said Jim Morrison, vice president at TechInsights. Some analysts also speculate the company could remove the phone’s home button, placing it and a fingerprint sensor beneath the front display glass, based on patents the company has filed. Apple will likely make a heavy marketing push around the phone’s 10th anniversary. “IPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement Jan. 8, the date the iPhone was announced by then-CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In 2015, the last year it disclosed the figure, Apple spent $1.8 billion on advertising, up 50 percent from the year before and nearly four times the $467 million it spent in 2007 when it first released the iPhone. And the company continues to excel at selling higher-priced phones. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri attributed the most recent quarter’s record-setting 78.3 million iPhones sold to the iPhone 7 Plus, which for the first time included a new dual camera feature not found in other models. The iPhone 7 Plus tops out at $969 with memory upgrades and a jet black finish. O‘Donnell of Technalysis Research believes that with the next iPhone, Apple might even introduce a $1,000-plus “ultra-premium device for the real Apple-crazed folks out there who want to stand out.” "

"2017-02-17",0,"Apple’s move comes as it seeks to boost its share in the world’s fastest growing major mobile market, where handsets far cheaper than Apple’s iPhones dominate. It also comes as smartphone sales growth is slowing in Asia’s other massive market, China. To lower prices, Apple has been seeking to set up local production and has been in talks with the Indian federal government regarding issues such as tax concessions. The industry source told Reuters the initial manufacturing of the iPhone SE model was not contingent on those concessions. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Economic Times newspaper earlier on Friday reported Apple planned to initially assemble 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. The industry source told Reuters the numbers would be substantially lower to begin with. The source also said it was too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, with a third coming in the December quarter, according to market researcher Counterpoint, which estimates that three-quarters of smartphones sold in India were made locally. In the fourth quarter, Apple ranked 10th in India’s smartphone market but led the premium segment with a 62 percent market share, Counterpoint said. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and a host of Chinese players including Xiaomi and Vivo dominate India’s smartphone market where the vast majority of phones sold are priced below 15,000 rupees ($225). In comparison, the entry level iPhone SE model sells on Amazon.com’s India site for 28,433 rupees ($424). "

But Apple Inc’s long list of demands, including tax concessions and several other policy exceptions, still faces resistance from officials who consider it excessive and unfair on foreign companies already operating in India. Their caution underlines how Modi’s ambition to make India a global manufacturing hub, in order to drive the economy and create jobs for millions of people entering the workforce each year, will not be easy. “We have not done this for anyone,” said a senior government official whose department is one of several involved in evaluating the Apple proposal. “If we do this, we must see a lot of value addition.” Another official involved in the review said the government should make policies for the industry, not individual companies. “Apple is coming here because it sees a lucrative market, this is not a favor being done to India.” Competitors such as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and China’s Xiaomi have already set up manufacturing in the country. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Where any plant would be located and how many people it might employ have yet to be finalised, although it would likely involve thousands of jobs. Attracting such a household name would be a valuable advertisement for a country shaking off a reputation for stifling bureaucracy, but officials are wary of tailoring rules to individual investors. “What Apple is trying to do, if it happens, I think it will be available to everybody in the industry. I don’t see the government of India making discriminatory policies,” said Arvind Vohra, chief executive at Gionee India, part of Chinese smartphone maker Gionee. It is setting up a local manufacturing plant under India’s existing rules. In a letter sent to the prime minister’s office on Oct. 13 and seen by Reuters, it called on the government to “make the environment attractive” for it to make phones for the Indian market as well as for export. On the matter of duties, it said high import taxes on smartphones could lead to retaliation from trading blocs. “This would increase the cost of India manufactured smartphones and in turn limit India’s ambition of becoming a smartphone hub for the rest of the world.” Despite the reluctance of some officials, Modi could intervene to get the Apple project back on schedule. In June, the government relaxed local sourcing rules for foreign retailers like Apple barely a month after the finance ministry turned down the company’s request for a waiver. The company and its partners have reportedly won significant concessions before in other markets. In May, Modi and Cook agreed to work towards a “package” of four projects: assembling iPhones, opening Apple stores, importing certified pre-owned iPhones and refurbishing them in India, according to the letter.  Apple said its initial focus was to set up manufacturing of iPhones in India over two phases, the first of which was to be introduced by spring this year. But after conducting due diligence on what it would take to get the project going, it determined its entry was “dependent on government support on a number of pre-requisites.” The Cupertino, Calif.-based company listed a set of seven demands. Among them, it sought duty exemption on raw materials for manufacturing, components and capital equipment for 15 years for both domestic and export markets. Apple also sought a change in rules that would govern how it could import defective iPhones to repair and export them again, a move it said was crucial for it to keep supporting and repairing older models of the iPhone. Currently, Indian rules restrict such imports to phones that are no older than three years.     Apple asked for the government’s help in quickly processing a request for a ruling from Indian tax authorities on transfer pricing agreements between its affiliates. It also identified India’s customs procedures as a hurdle to manufacturing and asked the government to make them less onerous. “For trusted traders inspections need to be less intrusive - this means less boxes opened,” Apple wrote. “The complete process should not require more than thirty minutes.” "
"2017-02-12",0,"Under Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed with the approval of authorities. A cartel would strengthen the banks in negotiating the ability to offer their own digital wallets for Apple’s iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind globally. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals.  Apple charges card providers for transactions made using Apple Pay and does not allow companies to develop their own mobile wallets, which would allow banks to circumvent transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps. In the banks’ initial application lodged in July, they sought to negotiate with Apple over fees as well as access to the contactless payments function. At the time, ACCC Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters that if fees were at the heart of the banks’ application, then it would be difficult for them to win approval. But if the issue was more about access to Apple’s contactless payment technology, then the banks had a stronger case, he said.  “It is about the consumer having the choice of multiple wallets,” said Lance Blockley, a spokesman for the banks. In a submission to the competition regulator on Jan. 31, Apple said there were no public benefits to providing the banks access to its contactless payment system, and that doing so would give them a “free-ride” on Apple’s investment in technology. Among other banks, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) has offered Apple Pay to customers since April, while Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) and ING Groep NV’s (INGA.AS) ING Direct on Friday said they would introduce Apple Pay this month.

"2017-04-03",-7,"“The biggest risk to Imagination’s business model was realized this morning,” analysts at Investec said. “The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company.”  MORE FROM REUTERS   * Video: Inventor hopes eTrike will succeed where uncle failed  * Tesla first-quarter vehicle deliveries jumped 69 percent   * In self-driving car race, winners get all the way around track  The technology company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics.  Imagination said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead.  “It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information,” Chief Executive Andrew Heath said.  “As such we do not accept their assertion that they no longer require our technology.”  The company said it had asked Apple for evidence that it could dispense with all of Imagination’s technology, “but Apple has declined to provide it”.  Apple declined to comment.  Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012.  They were down 64 percent at 97 pence by 1350 GMT, giving the company a market value of 275 million pounds ($372 million), or 479 million pounds less than it was worth on Friday.  “There is a difference here though”, they said. “Imagination holds significant patents around graphics cores, in particular those which allow lower power use, and is considering discussing different commercial arrangements with Apple.”  Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel (INTC.O) bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012.  It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints.  Imagination says it has just over 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market - nearly all of which stems from Apple, although MediaTek (2454.TW) also selected its graphics for its new chipset last month.  But Imagination only has 7 percent of the market for mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to gain share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers.  Imagination said it would talk with Apple about alternative commercial arrangements.  Analysts said there could be room for compromise, and it could even be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties.  Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said.  Most of its costs are incurred in developing technologies years ahead of when they are deployed in products, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with Apple’s revenue.  Around half of its non-Apple revenue comes from the MIPS processing platform it bought in 2012 in an attempt to extend its product line-up beyond graphics.  Customers for the MIPS technology include Israeli automated vehicle driving systems specialist Mobileye MBLY.N and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications, according to analysts.  "

"2017-02-13",1,"Its increase helped balloon the S&P 500's .SPX market capitalization on Monday beyond $20 trillion for the first time. While mutual funds have largely bet on Apple in recent months, some big names missed out on all or part of its recent acceleration. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC cut its stake in Apple by 26 percent to 1.9 million shares in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory filings, while George Soros and Carl Icahn also shed their Apple shares last year. In contrast, the number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 187 percent to 287, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 26 percent to 151, according to Morningstar. Apple has climbed 50 percent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 15 percent so far in 2017. It was still short of its all-time intraday high of $134.54, set on April 28, 2015. Monday’s gain came after Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski raised her price target for Apple to $150. She said she is more confident that an upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will feature augmented-reality technology, which could help boost demand in a saturated smartphone market. Many investors are betting that Apple will mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. They also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. The Cupertino, California company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31, and although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016.  In 1998, when the S&P 500 closed above $10 trillion for the first time, Apple accounted for just under 0.06 percent of the index. It now accounts for about 3.5 percent of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The 721 days that have passed since Apple’s previous record-high close represent the largest gap between such milestones since the iPhone’s launch in 2007. "

"2017-02-13",1,"Its increase helped balloon the S&P 500's .SPX market capitalization on Monday beyond $20 trillion for the first time. While mutual funds have largely bet on Apple in recent months, some big names missed out on all or part of its recent acceleration. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC cut its stake in Apple by 26 percent to 1.9 million shares in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory filings, while George Soros and Carl Icahn also shed their Apple shares last year. In contrast, the number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 187 percent to 287, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 26 percent to 151, according to Morningstar. Apple has climbed 50 percent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 15 percent so far in 2017. It was still short of its all-time intraday high of $134.54, set on April 28, 2015. Monday’s gain came after Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski raised her price target for Apple to $150. She said she is more confident that an upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will feature augmented-reality technology, which could help boost demand in a saturated smartphone market. Many investors are betting that Apple will mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. They also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. The Cupertino, California company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31, and although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016.  In 1998, when the S&P 500 closed above $10 trillion for the first time, Apple accounted for just under 0.06 percent of the index. It now accounts for about 3.5 percent of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The 721 days that have passed since Apple’s previous record-high close represent the largest gap between such milestones since the iPhone’s launch in 2007. "

"2017-02-07",-4,"By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Inside the original Macintosh computer, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs inscribed the signatures of his team, revealing his deep concern for even the hidden features of his products. His last work - Apple Inc’s sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. But constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs’ initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Apple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion - a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. For all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused  on the right ends. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. “It’s not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it’s about creating a symbolic center for this global company,” she said. “They are creating an icon.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. WORLD‘S LARGEST PIECE OF CURVED GLASS Tech companies have long favored generic office parks, which allow them to lease and shed space through booms and busts. Jobs’ unveiling of what’s formally known as Apple Campus 2, months before his death, marked a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description. The main building - which boasts the world’s largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees. Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact as the land passed from tech giant to tech giant. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers’ insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple’s in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages. Tolerances, the distance materials may deviate from desired measurements, were a particular focus. On many projects, the standard is 1/8 of an inch at best; Apple often demanded far less, even for hidden surfaces. The company’s keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. “With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,” he said. “You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.” The project, which generated about 13,000 full-time construction jobs, took a toll on contractors. The original general contractors, Skanska USA and DPR Construction, left after work began, which construction experts called a rare development for a project of such scale. The reasons for the departures are unclear, and neither Apple nor the firms would comment. But de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. “They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,” de la Torre said. Fanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone’s audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Thus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple’s in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. “The things you can’t see, they all mattered to Apple,” the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. “We spent months trying not to do that because that’s time, money and stuff that’s never been done before,” the former construction manager said. Time and time again, Apple managers spent months perfecting minute features, creating a domino effect that set back other parts of the project, former construction managers say. Signage required a delicate balancing act: Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency. Dirk Mattern, a retired deputy fire chief who is representing the Santa Clara County Fire Department on the project, estimated he attended 15 meetings that touched on the topic. “I’ve never spent so much time on signage,” he said. After months of back and forth, construction workers presented their work to a manager from Apple’s in-house team, who turned the sample over and over in his hands. Finally, he said he felt a faint bump. The construction team double-checked the measurements, unable to find any imperfections - down to the nanometer. Still, Apple insisted on another version. The construction manager who was so intimately involved in the door handle did not see its completion. Down to his last day, Apple was still fiddling with the design - after a year and a half of debate. When construction wraps, the only fingerprints on the site will be Jobs’. Workers often had to wear gloves to avoid marring the delicate materials, said Brett Davis, regional director of the District Council 16 union for painters and related crafts. “It’s like a painting that you don’t want to touch,” he said. “It’s definitely going to be something to see, if they let you in.” "

"2017-01-10",3,"Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company’s website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner’s posted message. The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla’s Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.  Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year. Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language “open source,” meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages. "

"2017-01-31",3,"But the gains were tempered by Apple’s cautious outlook for the current quarter, which it mainly attributed to the strong U.S. dollar, which hurts companies like Apple that sell a majority of their products overseas, by forcing them to raise prices, which depresses unit sales, or sacrifice margins. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million the year before. Analysts on average had expected 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. That beat Samsung Electronics’ 77.5 million smartphone sales in the quarter, according to tech data firm Strategy Analytics, the first time that has happened since the fourth quarter of 2011. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung’s much-publicized recall of the its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7.  Apple is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution OLED display. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said demand was especially high for the larger iPhone 7 Plus in the fiscal first quarter. Revenue in the services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - jumped 18.4 percent to $7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see,” Cook told analysts in response to a question. “We are always looking at acquisitions... There’s not a size we wouldn’t do just based on the size of it. It’s more about the strategic value.” Analysts expect growth in services to help offset declining hardware sales as the smartphone market matures. The services business also has gross margins that are higher than Apple’s overall company average, which could help offset the extra cost of new features like the OLED screens while still meeting an overall gross margin target of between 38 percent and 39 percent.  “That’s a very high-margin business that is helping Apple navigate its innovation,” said Anil Doradla, an analyst with William Blair & Co. Cook said on Tuesday that he expects services revenue to double in the next four years as the installed base of iPhones and iPads continues to grow. “We were encouraged by our performance in China because it was clearly an improvement over the last couple of quarters. In mainland China in particular, our revenue was flat and actually grew in constant currency terms,” Maestri said. The company forecast revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts, on average, expect revenue of $53.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The rate at which previous Apple customers buy new phones was the same as last year in international markets, executives said, without giving specific numbers. Maestri said the company has had to raise prices as much as 40 percent in some markets. “Clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn’t help us,” Maestri said. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 53.43 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the holiday quarter reported on Tuesday, net income fell to $17.89 billion from $18.36 billion the year before. On a per share basis, it earned $3.36, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3.3 percent to $78.35 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $77.25 billion. Up to Tuesday’s close, Apple’s shares have gained about 15 percent since mid-November, compared with the 5.3 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "

"2017-02-09",3,"ING Direct and Macquarie have well-known brand names and national reach, giving them a potential leg up over similar-sized regional rivals like Bendigo and Adelaide Bank and Bank of Queensland in attracting retail banking and mortgage customers with technology.  “In the context of the Big Four, it feels like the sector is ripe for disruption,” Dominic Walsh, a managing director of branding firm Landor Associates, told Reuters.  “If you are a competitor like an ING or one of these other challenger entrants you need to provide a product that is superior.”  The major lenders ANZ, National Australia Bank Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp control about 80 percent of Australia’s mortgage market and regulators are likely to welcome greater competition from smaller banks mobile banking platforms. ING Direct and Macquarie, which each have less than 3 percent retail market share, both lack physical branch networks. That gives them a cost advantage over the Big Four but means they rely on digital channels and word of mouth. Macquarie Bank Head of Personal Banking Ben Perham said the introduction of Apple Pay, allowing customers to make payments with iPhones and Apple Watches, would further enhance the bank’s digital offering. “We’ve seen strong interest in Apple Pay from our customers and we’re delighted to confirm it will be available later this month,” he said in a statement. ING Direct Executive Director, Customers John Arnott said most of the Dutch-owned bank’s 500,000 Orange Everday account customers preferred to connect through mobile devices.  “For many of them, their smartphone is their bank, and it’s a natural extension that their iPhone will also become their wallet,” he said in a statement.  ING Direct has operated in Australia since 1999, with an initial focus on high-interest savings accounts. The bank, which also offers mortgages, has plans to introduce new credit card and life insurance products.

"2017-02-09",3,"ING Direct and Macquarie have well-known brand names and national reach, giving them a potential leg up over similar-sized regional rivals like Bendigo and Adelaide Bank and Bank of Queensland in attracting retail banking and mortgage customers with technology.  “In the context of the Big Four, it feels like the sector is ripe for disruption,” Dominic Walsh, a managing director of branding firm Landor Associates, told Reuters.  “If you are a competitor like an ING or one of these other challenger entrants you need to provide a product that is superior.”  The major lenders ANZ, National Australia Bank Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp control about 80 percent of Australia’s mortgage market and regulators are likely to welcome greater competition from smaller banks mobile banking platforms. ING Direct and Macquarie, which each have less than 3 percent retail market share, both lack physical branch networks. That gives them a cost advantage over the Big Four but means they rely on digital channels and word of mouth. Macquarie Bank Head of Personal Banking Ben Perham said the introduction of Apple Pay, allowing customers to make payments with iPhones and Apple Watches, would further enhance the bank’s digital offering. “We’ve seen strong interest in Apple Pay from our customers and we’re delighted to confirm it will be available later this month,” he said in a statement. ING Direct Executive Director, Customers John Arnott said most of the Dutch-owned bank’s 500,000 Orange Everday account customers preferred to connect through mobile devices.  “For many of them, their smartphone is their bank, and it’s a natural extension that their iPhone will also become their wallet,” he said in a statement.  ING Direct has operated in Australia since 1999, with an initial focus on high-interest savings accounts. The bank, which also offers mortgages, has plans to introduce new credit card and life insurance products.

"2017-01-05",-3,"Apple has sought tax concessions, including lower import and manufacturing duties, to make iPhones locally, according to a government official familiar with the situation. Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said if India were to agree to any concessions, they would likely apply to all smartphone manufacturers, and not just Apple. Apple declined to comment. Apple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook met Modi last May to talk about its plans to enter the Indian manufacturing and retail space. Cupertino, California-based Apple wants to boost iPhone sales in India, where it has only a roughly 2 percent market share, as sales in the United States and China slow.  Smartphone component maker Wistron Corp (3231.TW), which counts Apple among its customers, has applied for permission to expand its plant in Bengaluru, a regional government official told Reuters on Monday. The tech giant had earlier asked for a permanent relaxation of rules requiring 30 percent local sourcing for foreign retailers setting up single-brand outlets, which was rejected by the finance ministry. India has relaxed these rules for just three years for single-brand foreign investors. India had also refused to allow Apple’s proposal to import and sell refurbished mobile phones in India. The company has again sought a permanent waiver from local sourcing condition as it imports most of the handsets to sell in India and other countries, another official said. India offers capital subsidies for companies manufacturing electronics goods in India, coupled with tax incentives for investments in special economic zones and allows tax-free imports of some components used to make mobile handsets.  “We have sent Apple’s file to the revenue department,” a top industry department official told Reuters. He said an inter-ministerial panel of the trade, electronics and finance ministry could take a final decision.   "
"2017-01-10",3,"Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company’s website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner’s posted message. The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla’s Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.  Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year. Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language “open source,” meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages. "

"2017-01-25",1,"Apple has demanded a series of tax and sourcing concessions from India, before it begins to assemble iPhones in the country, Reuters reported last week. Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters that Apple executives were supposed to meet with officials from the industry, information technology and finance departments on Wednesday to discuss their demands. “We’ve been working hard to develop our operations in India,” Apple said in a brief statement. “We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we’ve had with government about further expanding our local operations.”    "
"2017-02-01",-2,"This has only built expectations, however, that the 10th-anniversary iPhone will need to offer revolutionary new features if it is to trigger a substantial uptick in sales. “This is really the last (quarter) that anybody is going to care about iPhone until the launch this fall,” Cowen & Co analysts wrote in a note. “It can be said that iPhone 7/7+ ‘did its job’ as a bridge to get to the supercycle in 2017.” Apple’s shares rose as much as 5.8 percent to $128.30 early on Wednesday, their highest in 18 months, a day after the company dethroned Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) as the world’s top smartphone seller based on units shipped. At the day’s high, more than $36 billion was added to the company’s market value. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected sales of 77.42 million. The sales reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales and come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung’s much-publicized recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. The company typically launches new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back in anticipation of the next launch. Existing iPhone users tend to upgrade their devices when the new model has significant design changes. Apple last saw a significant uptick in sales with the introduction of iPhone 6 in 2015. “We see pent-up demand heading into a significant form factor change that is likely to accelerate iPhone unit growth,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. At least twelve brokerages raised their price targets on Apple. Stifel Nicolaus & Co and RBC Capital Markets - the most bullish brokerages - raised their price targets by $15. No brokerage changed their rating on the stock. Of the 48 analysts covering Apple’s stock, 39 have a “buy” rating or higher. Eight have a “hold” rating and one a “sell”. Their median price target is $139.         To Tuesday’s close of $121.35, Apple’s shares had risen nearly 25 percent in the past 12 months. "
"2017-02-28",-2,"”We’re always looking for more ways to help our country. We know that Apple can only exist in the U.S.,” Cook told shareholders. Apple’s stock is trading at record highs on expectations of improved iPhone demand this year following a decline in sales in 2016.   Shareholders at the meeting at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California defeated a proxy proposal that would have let them nominate two directors on the company’s board. The proposal won 31.9 percent of votes.  Shareholders also defeated a proposal to require Apple executives to retain their shares until they retire. That vote won 24.2-percent support. An advisory vote to approve executive pay won 95.2 percent support. Apple’s stock has surged 41 percent over the past 12 months. On Tuesday, it was up 0.21 percent at $137.21, on track for a record high close. "
"2017-01-27",-8,"Apple’s 15-percent rally since mid-November pushed the stock to levels not seen in more than a year and boosted over 100 mutual funds that became shareholders in recent quarters. The gains have come even as Apple struggles with slow global demand for smartphones, made worse by consumers in key growth regions like China and India preferring Android devices selling for under $200. The stock is up 36 percent from lows in May of last year, when it was plagued by worries about iPhone sales, which fell in 2016 for the first time. The shares are now down 8 percent from a record high close in February 2015.  Many on Wall Street expect Apple, which reports its fiscal first-quarter results on Tuesday, to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year with a dramatically improved model.  Apple has not disclosed details, but analysts have speculated about potential new features including better haptic technology, wireless charging and a curved display that many believe will attract consumers who have begun to lose interest in smartphones.  “We think this is going to be a pretty solid launch, a really big one,” said Brian Hennessey, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund, whose largest holding is Apple. “I think even the bears would probably suggest that this product that’s coming out is going to be pretty interesting and hard to ignore.”  The number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 188 percent to 288, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 25 percent to 154, according to Morningstar. Strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have arguably left a larger-than-normal base of customers now ready to upgrade to new devices in what several analysts have describe as a “supercycle.”  Citing recent supply and demand checks, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty on Jan. 16 cut her estimate for December-quarter iPhone shipments to 75 million units from 79 million, and she warned that Apple would likely give March-quarter guidance below investors’ expectations. But confident about pent up demand, Huberty raised her iPhone estimates for the fiscal year starting in October and said Apple remains a top pick.  Apple’s recent stock gain makes the success of its next iPhone all the more crucial, said Trip Miller, managing partner of hedge fund Gullane Capital. Attracted to the healthy balance sheet and a price/earnings multiple that is low versus the S&P 500’s average, the fund added to an existing Apple stake after the stock swooned last year. Apple currently makes up about 5 percent of its portfolio, Miller said. Apple is rushing to expand music streaming and other services that provide recurring revenues in a bid to offset lackluster iPhones sales, which still account for 60 percent of total revenue. “They really need to have a big value-add in the next product they come out with,” Miller said.  Also sounding a cautious note, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz downgraded Apple on Jan. 24 to “equal weight” from “overweight”, warning that this year’s new iPhones may not entice consumers increasingly content to keep their devices for three or four years, instead of two or three. Apple’s recent rally has left its stock trading at 12.9 times expected earnings, pricier than its five-year average of about 12.0 times expected earnings but far cheaper than the S&P 500’s multiple of 17.2 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  After three consecutive quarters of declines, Apple in the December-quarter is expected by analysts to report a 2-percent increase in revenue to $77.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue for fiscal 2017 is expected by analysts to grow 5.5 percent, recovering some of last year’s 7.7 percent decline.

"2017-01-25",-20,"Apple also filed a second lawsuit against Qualcomm which accused it of failing to live up to promises made to license “standard essential patents” broadly and inexpensively. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In an emailed statement, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen the full complaints against it filed in the Chinese court. But Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said Qualcomm had offered Apple the same terms as other customers after a 2015 regulatory ruling in China and that his firm would defend its business model in Chinese courts. “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.” The lawsuits follow a decision by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to file a complaint on Jan. 17 in which it accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly of a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. Apple followed with a related lawsuit last Friday. It asked a federal court in California for $1 billion in promised rebates and accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips. Qualcomm did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The company said previously that it would contest both the FTC and the Apple lawsuit filed in the United States. The chip maker faces legal challenges across the globe. South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court.

"2017-01-20",-19,"In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. ”We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. "

The courts have yet to address the substance of the iPhone users’ allegations; up this point, the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place.

Prasad’s comments came after the federal cabinet revamped a subsidy program for electronic manufacturing, tightening some of its provisions following objections from the finance ministry. He announced a cap of $1.5 billion on the amount of subsidy the government provided under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) designed to boost electronics manufacturing. The finance ministry had raised concerns about the scheme because of a lack of clarity about the subsidy payout, delaying a slew of investment proposals.

"2017-02-14",9,"Its final level of $135.02, a gain of 1.30 percent, was Apple’s second consecutive record closing price.  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said in a filing it more than tripled its stake in Apple during the December quarter to 57.4 million shares from 15.2 million shares.  It is unclear what Berkshire paid for its Apple shares, but so far in 2017 their value has increased by $1.1 billion, and legendary investor Buffett’s increased interest in Apple could boost already positive sentiment on Wall Street.   The S&P 500’s largest component has climbed 50 percent from its low in the first half of last year and is up almost 17 percent so far in 2017, with many investors betting that Apple will mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. Many on Wall Street also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. “We’re holding it, we look for opportunities to buy,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Consumers feel better, people spend more money. There’s still a lot of good to come from Apple.”  The Cupertino, California, company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31. Although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. Apple’s stock recently traded at 14.3 times expected earnings, the highest level since April 2015 and significantly higher than the average price-earnings ratio of 12 over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

"2016-12-22",-8,"Nokia’s patent licence contract with Apple expires at the end of the year. This week, both sides have taken legal action - with Nokia accusing Apple of violating some technology patents and Apple complaining of being overcharged - suggesting a new deal will be hard to agree. Patent royalties represent a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from sales of telecoms network equipment. But the licensing payments are highly profitable at a time when the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. “Nokia will likely be granted a better licence deal from Apple. But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on Nokia shares. Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 and focused on its network business as well as a bulging portfolio of mobile device patents. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome. “The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants,” he wrote in a note to clients. “It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair,” he said, adding Nokia could also “choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S.” Um rates both companies’ shares as “market perform”. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. The Finnish firm has forecast the run-rate of its patent and brand licensing sales will be about 950 million euros ($994 million) by the end of 2016, but that it will fall to about 800 million after the Apple deal expires, in the absence of a new one. Nokia’s total sales in 2016 are expected to top 24 billion euros. Its shares were down 4.6 percent at 4.52 euros at 1010 GMT, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock. "

"2017-01-13",-29,"Consumers don’t much like paying tolls. Both Ticketmaster and Apple were sued in antitrust class actions accusing them of taking advantage of their distribution strangleholds, Ticketmaster back in the 1990s and Apple in 2011. In 1998, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed concertgoers’ antitrust claims in Campos v. Ticketmaster. But on Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that iPhone app buyers can proceed - despite the 8th Circuit’s Ticketmaster decision and parallels in consumer claims against the two companies.  The 9th Circuit split with the 8th on the dispositive question of whether consumers are direct or indirect purchasers of the distribution services Ticketmaster and Apple provide. As you probably know, that’s a critical difference in antitrust cases. The U.S. Supreme Court has held - first in 1968’s Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe and then, more famously, in 1977’s Illinois Brick v. State of Illinois - that purchasers at the end of a tainted supply chain can’t bring antitrust claims against a monopolist because it’s too hard for courts to figure out what portion of the product’s ultimate cost is attributable to illegal conduct. Under the court’s so-called Illinois Brick precedent, only direct purchasers have standing to sue monopolists.  In the sort of classic manufacturing supply chains at issue in Hanover Shoe, which involved allegedly inflated lease prices for shoemaking equipment, and Illinois Brick, in which the state claimed masonry contractors passed along inflated charges for concrete blocks, it’s easy to discern a bright line between direct and indirect purchasers. The split between the 8th and 9th Circuits in the Ticketmaster and Apple cases shows how the line blurs when the alleged monopolist is selling a service instead of a tangible product.  The 8th Circuit majority in Ticketmaster found concertgoers to be indirect purchasers who were forced to use the company’s services only because Ticketmaster first pushed concert venues into exclusive ticket distribution contracts. “Such derivative dealing is the essence of indirect purchaser status,” the majority said. “The plaintiffs’ inability to obtain ticket delivery services in a competitive market is simply the consequence of the antecedent inability of venues to do so.”  In a dissent, Judge Morris Arnold suggested his colleagues weren’t paying attention to Ticketmaster’s real product: not tickets but ticket distribution services. “Ticketmaster supplies the product directly to concert-goers; it does not supply it first to venue operators who in turn supply it to concertgoers,” Arnold wrote. “It is immaterial that Ticketmaster would not be supplying the service but for its antecedent agreement with the venues. But it is quite relevant that the antecedent agreement was not one in which the venues bought some product from Ticketmaster in order to resell it to concertgoers.”  The 9th Circuit’s Apple opinion, written by Judge William Fletcher for a panel that also included Judge Wallace Tashima and U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman of Chicago, sitting by designation, said the Ticketmaster dissent was right. In selling iPhone apps, Apple is not an ordinary manufacturer or producer, the opinion said. It is a distributor, selling apps directly to consumers through the App Store.  The 9th Circuit insisted on figuring out the essential relationship between Apple and app purchasers instead of taking the easy way out by basing its ruling on the mere fact that consumers pay the App Store for purchases. “Whether a purchase is direct or indirect does not turn on the formalities of payment or bookkeeping arrangements,” the opinion said. “The key to the analysis is the function Apple serves rather than the manner in which it receives compensation for performing that function.”  Apple’s lawyers at Latham & Watkins had argued that the company is indeed a distributor, but that its customers are app developers, not the consumers who buy apps. It compared itself to a shopping mall owner that leases space to stores, but the 9th Circuit disputed Apple’s brick-and-mortar analogy. “Third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own ‘stores,’” the opinion said “Indeed, part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by plaintiffs is that, far from allowing iPhone app developers to sell through their own ‘stores,’ Apple specifically forbids them to do so, instead requiring them to sell iPhone apps only through Apple’s App Store.”  It seems to me the 9th Circuit’s reasoning could be problematic for other tech companies that could be defined as distributors. I expect amici to weigh in if Apple asks for en banc reconsideration.  Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz represented plaintiffs in the iPhone case. Apple declined a Reuters request for comment on the 9th Circuit opinion."

"2016-12-20",-2,"But Apple’s latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products.  “They’re basically saying this is the future of headphones,” said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple’s future.  “There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years,” Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices. The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews.  The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed.  The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods’ construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. “I can’t do it by hand.

Prasad also said a government panel headed by the cabinet secretary would now clear investment proposals in the electronic sector above $1 billion, instead of them going through multiple government departments. Prasad’s comments came after the federal cabinet revamped a subsidy program for electronic manufacturing, tightening some of its provisions following objections from the finance ministry. He announced a cap of $1.5 billion on the amount of subsidy the government provided under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) designed to boost electronics manufacturing. The finance ministry had raised concerns about the scheme because of a lack of clarity about the subsidy payout, delaying a slew of investment proposals. Apple has offered to manufacture iPhones in the country both for the domestic market as well as exports, in a potential boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” program to expand a domestic industrial base and create millions of jobs. “We want to make India a big hub of electronic manufacturing,” Prasad said.

"2017-01-05",-3,"Apple has sought tax concessions, including lower import and manufacturing duties, to make iPhones locally, according to a government official familiar with the situation. Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said if India were to agree to any concessions, they would likely apply to all smartphone manufacturers, and not just Apple. Apple declined to comment. Apple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook met Modi last May to talk about its plans to enter the Indian manufacturing and retail space. Cupertino, California-based Apple wants to boost iPhone sales in India, where it has only a roughly 2 percent market share, as sales in the United States and China slow.  Smartphone component maker Wistron Corp (3231.TW), which counts Apple among its customers, has applied for permission to expand its plant in Bengaluru, a regional government official told Reuters on Monday. The tech giant had earlier asked for a permanent relaxation of rules requiring 30 percent local sourcing for foreign retailers setting up single-brand outlets, which was rejected by the finance ministry. India has relaxed these rules for just three years for single-brand foreign investors. India had also refused to allow Apple’s proposal to import and sell refurbished mobile phones in India. The company has again sought a permanent waiver from local sourcing condition as it imports most of the handsets to sell in India and other countries, another official said. India offers capital subsidies for companies manufacturing electronics goods in India, coupled with tax incentives for investments in special economic zones and allows tax-free imports of some components used to make mobile handsets.  “We have sent Apple’s file to the revenue department,” a top industry department official told Reuters. He said an inter-ministerial panel of the trade, electronics and finance ministry could take a final decision.   "
"2016-12-22",-1,"Nokia shares were down nearly 5 percent at 4.496 euros on Thursday as analysts warned a legal battle with Apple could hold up royalty payments that are vital to shoring up the Finnish company’s profits. "
"2016-12-22",-8,"Nokia filed further complaints against Apple on Thursday, saying it had now filed 40 patents suits in 11 countries covering technologies such as displays, software and chipsets. ”Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today’s mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights“, ” Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Nokia patent business said in a statement. Patent royalties represent a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from sales of telecoms network equipment. But the licensing payments are highly profitable at a time when the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump.     “Nokia will likely be granted a better license deal from Apple. But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on Nokia shares.     Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft (MSFT.O) in 2014 and focused on its network business as well as a bulging portfolio of mobile device patents.     Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome.     “The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants,” he wrote in a note to clients. “It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair,” he said, adding Nokia could also “choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S.” Um rates both companies’ shares as “market perform”. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features.  The Finnish firm has forecast the run-rate of its patent and brand licensing sales will be about 950 million euros ($994 million) by the end of 2016, but that it will fall to about 800 million after the Apple deal expires, in the absence of a new one.     Nokia’s total sales in 2016 are expected to top 24 billion euros.  Its shares in Helsinki closed at 4.5 euros, and are down some 30 percent since the start of 2016. In New York Nokia shares (NOK.N) traded down 0.6 percent at 4.73 dollars. "

"2016-12-20",-2,"But Apple’s latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products.  “They’re basically saying this is the future of headphones,” said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple’s future.  “There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years,” Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices. The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews.  The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed.  The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods’ construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. “I can’t do it by hand. It’s cost prohibitive,” Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that “there’s a relatively high risk of fire”. "

Shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. A number of analysts, however, raised questions about the wisdom of Apple switching from one of its long-time vendors at a time when it has already had to push back the release of its 10th anniversary iPhone X due to issues with new tech. “While Intel’s new modem does support CDMA, it will be their first generation CDMA device, which carries inherent risks,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso told Reuters. Another analyst, Baird Equity’s Tristan Gerra, said the share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years from less than 50 percent currently. “The jury is still out if Apple decides to go in this direction and away from Qualcomm but it would be a potentially game-changing move,” Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights told Reuters.

"2017-01-31",4,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc reported a bigger-than-expected rise in iPhone sales for the holiday quarter, driven by strong demand for the latest version of its flagship smartphone. Shares of the world’s most valuable listed company were up 2.6 percent at $124.50 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million last year, marking the first quarterly growth in iPhone sales in a year. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Revenue in the Greater China region fell 11.6 percent to $16.23 billion, highlighting Apple’s struggles in a hotly contested smartphone market. The company also forecast revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $53.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that a stronger dollar hurt the company’s revenue forecast. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 53.43 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. The company is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for 69.4 percent of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to OLED display. Apple’s services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - recorded a 18.4 percent growth in revenue to $7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions. Cowen & Co and Mizuho Securities had expected revenue of about $7 billion, while FactSet had forecast $6.91 billion. Analysts expect growing revenue from Apple’s services segment to  help offset declining hardware sales as the smart phone market matures. The company’s net income fell to $17.89 billion, or $3.36 per share, in the quarter from $18.36 billion, or $3.28 per share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $3.12 per share.

"2017-10-31",-4,"Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship took a bad turn earlier this year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The change would affect iPhones released in the fall of 2018, but Apple could still change course before then, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Shares of Intel Corp — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. Analysts have estimated Qualcomm to have just over 50 percent of the share of modem chips in iPhones, with Intel making up the rest. “Qualcomm’s share represents about $1.5-1.75 billion in annual revenue,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said. That estimate is less than a tenth of Qualcomm’s 2016 revenue of $23.55 billion, and under 5 percent of Intel’s annual revenue of nearly $60 billion. The share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years, rapidly shrinking losses in the chipmaker’s mobile phone business, Baird Equity analyst Tristan Gerra said.

The internet regulator did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the Times’ apps.  “The development of the internet in China must respect China’s laws and regulations, in principle,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in response to a question about the apps.  New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told Reuters that the newspaper has asked Apple to reconsider.  “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country,” Murphy said.  The government has blocked the Times’ websites since 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth of the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the New York Times reported.  An Apple spokeswoman in China declined to comment on specific reasons or which regulatory body made the request.  Apps from other international publications whose websites are blocked, including CNN, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, were still available on Thursday.  Chinese mainstream media has not reported the app removal but it was discussed widely on social media.  “This must be coming from the request of The Wall right?” said one user on microblogging service Weibo, referring to state-backed internet censorship. “Apple has made enough money in China, it’s OK for it to take the blame this time for the sake of the money.”  Other users said they would attempt to change their country of residence within the app store to restore access.

"2017-08-01",3,"* Honda surges after co raises FY profit outlook By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average posted modest gains on Wednesday, supported by strong earnings reports from local companies and by a rally in Apple suppliers after it reported robust profits. The Nikkei was up 0.4 percent at 20,058.24 points by mid-morning, after rising 0.3 percent on Tuesday. Apple suppliers soared, with Murata Manufacturing rising 3.2 percent, Taiyo Yuden rising 3.3 percent and TDK Corp gaining 1.9 percent after Apple Inc delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings and signaled that its upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone lineup is on schedule. Honda Motor Co soared more than 4 percent after Japan’s No.3 automaker raised its full-year operating profit forecast thanks to solid demand in Asia. While Japanese stocks have been supported by strong earnings from companies, traders say the Nikkei will continue to hover around the 20,000 mark because investors have been cautious about the risk of a further rise in the yen. “So far, companies are reporting better-than-expected results, but such positive catalysts are offset by worries about a strong yen,” said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities in Tokyo. “When the Nikkei is trading in a narrow range, retail investors are buying when the index is in the lower level in the range. Foreign investors would have chased the market higher if the yen weakens, but that’s not happening right now.” Although the dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 110.490 yen during Asian trade, it touched a near seven-week low of 109.920 yen overnight. The dollar has been weighed down by political turmoil gripping Washington and largely uninspiring U.S. economic data, which is adding to uncertainty about the pace of future U.S. Federal Reserve policy tightening.

"2017-01-31",7,"By Narottam Medhora and Stephen Nellis Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc reported its first quarterly increase in iPhone sales in a year, powered by strong demand for the latest version of its flagship smartphone, sending the company’s shares up more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million last year. Analysts on average had estimated 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. The company is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to OLED display. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said demand was especially high for the larger iPhone 7 Plus in the first quarter. Revenue in the services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - jumped 18.4 percent to $7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions. Analysts expect growth in the segment to help offset declining hardware sales as the smart phone market matures. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call on Tuesday that he expects services revenue to double in the next four years. “Services obviously continues to be a real success story for them. It’s one of the fastest-growing segments they have, driven largely by the App Store,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. Apple’s revenue from the Greater China region fell 11.6 percent to $16.23 billion. “We were encouraged by our performance in China because it was clearly an improvement over the last couple of quarters. In mainland China in particular, our revenue was flat and actually grew in constant currency terms,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said. The company also forecast revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $53.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Maestri added that a stronger dollar hurt the company’s revenue forecast. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 53.43 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. The company’s net income fell to $17.89 billion in the quarter from $18.36 billion a year ago. On a per share basis, it earned $3.36, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.12. Revenue rose 3.3 percent to $78.35 billion in the quarter, compared with the average estimate of $77.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Tuesday’s close, Apple’s shares have gained about 15 percent since mid-November, compared with the 5.3 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Shares of Apple dropped 1.4 percent to $145.42 after the company reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales and forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates. Apple was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes. The S&P technology sector fell 0.44 percent, making it the biggest drag on the benchmark index among the 11 major S&P sectors. Strong corporate reports so far had resulted in estimates for first-quarter profit growth at S&P 500 companies increasing to 14.2 percent as of Wednesday, from an estimate of 10.4 percent growth two weeks back, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’re about 70 percent through the earnings season and despite some isolated incidents, overall the season has been great,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “And that’s one of the reasons why the indexes are hovering near record levels.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P and the Nasdaq are less than one percent away from their record highs. “The SPX has spent several days in a consolidation phase, but has yet to see relief from short-term overbought conditions,” said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG in a note. “This could mean that a shallow pullback is needed to refresh the uptrend and allow for a breakout to new highs.” At 10:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT) the Dow was down 35.58 points, or 0.17 percent, at 20,914.31.

Shares of Apple dropped nearly 2 percent to $144.75 after the company also forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates. “The market is taking its cue from Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Automatic Data Processing fell 7 percent after its revenue missed expectations. Gilead dropped 2.3 percent after the drugmaker reported a lower-than-expected profit. Anadarko Petroleum fell 9.1 percent. The stocks were among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq and S&P. Strong corporate reports so far had resulted in estimates for first-quarter profit growth at S&P 500 companies increasing to 13.9 percent as of Tuesday, from an estimate of 10.4 percent growth two weeks back, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The strong earnings have also helped offset some fears about geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula, the lack of progress by the Trump administration in enacting its economic agenda as well as mixed economic data. “Strong earnings are still driving the market. Not only are earnings good, the CEOs are painting a picture of continued earnings growth and this helps trump some of the other factors,” said Kinahan. At 9:39 a.m. ET (1339 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.41 points, or 0.19 percent, at 20,909.48.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the technology index’s 0.55 percent fall leading the decliners. Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. Since then, automakers have reported a drop in vehicle dales for March, which along with the drop in iPhone sales, have added to nerves.

The data come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department’s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.

"2017-01-20",-19,"In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. ”We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. "

Traders said their shares were under pressure because Apple’s new $999 iPhone X will ship later than expected, on November 3. The price tag could also dent demand for the device in markets such as China. “With the iPhone coming in around $1,000 it will be interesting to see how healthy demand is,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  “If it’s relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and that consumers have confidence.” Chipmakers have been the best performing among Europe’s tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector’s outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. Richemont (CFR.S) fell 1.2 percent despite reporting a sales beat for its first half thanks to a recovery in the Asian luxury market. UBS analysts said weaker retail growth may weigh on sentiment.

IBM, whose full name is International Business Machines Corp, accounted for most of the stock sales that Buffett and his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made in the quarter. In May, Buffett revealed he had begun selling IBM, telling CNBC he did not value Big Blue as highly as he did six years earlier when he started buying. “IBM is a big strong company, but they’ve got big strong competitors, too,” he said. The IBM investment had been viewed as a surprise, given the 87-year-old Buffett’s resistance to investing in technology companies and businesses he found harder to understand. Berkshire has said it paid an average of about $170 per share for IBM. The shares closed up 49 cents at $148.89 on Tuesday, but fell in after-hours trading.

The Dow has risen 11 percent in 2017 and is on track for its sixth straight record close, even as Wall Street loses confidence that President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will be able to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending this year. The Dow hit the 20,000 level in late January and crossed the 21,000 mark on March 1. Two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have reported their second-quarter earnings so far and 72 percent of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In a typical quarter, 64 percent of companies beat expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.24 percent to end at 22,016.24, a record high.

"2016-12-22",-14,"“Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple’s products,” Nokia said in a statement. Apple on Tuesday had taken legal action against Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) and Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc [GEGGIM.UL], accusing them of colluding with Nokia to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly from Apple. “We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products,” said Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock. “Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with.”   Acacia and Conversant did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Nokia was not immediately available to comment on the Apple lawsuit. The legal action by Nokia and Apple appear to mark a revival of the “smartphone patent wars” that began five years ago, when Apple filed a series of patent infringement cases against Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) around the world, with wins and losses on both sides. Acacia is a publicly traded patent licensing firm based in Newport Beach, California. One of its subsidiaries sued Apple for patent infringement and was awarded $22 million by a Texas jury in September. Similarly, Conversant, which claims to own thousands of patents, announced last week that a Silicon Valley jury had awarded one of its units a $7.3 million settlement in an infringement case against Apple involving two smartphone patents.     Nokia, once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, missed out on the transition to smartphones triggered by Apple’s introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its handset business to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) two years ago, leaving it with its telecom network equipment business and a bulging portfolio of mobile equipment patents. But this year, Microsoft sold its Nokia-feature phone business to a new company called HMD Global. Nokia agreed to a 10-year licensing deal with HMD, which continues to market low-cost Nokia phones and plans to introduce new Nokia smartphone models next year. "

First-quarter profits of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index are expected to have risen 13.9 percent, the strongest rise since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.1.50.6 BP shares rose 1.6 percent after the oil major’s first-quarter profit tripled. Apple shares fell 1.2 percent to $145.75 in extended trading after the iPhone maker reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales. “The economy is doing better within Europe, but these also tend to be global companies,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at BlackRock. “The main reason why we are optimistic is because European companies are extremely well plugged in to benefit from the global reflation story, from China and U.S. growth picking up.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 percent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 gained 2.84 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,391.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.76 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,095.37. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.75 percent to end at a near 21-month high and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.27 percent to an all-time high. The yen weakened 0.13 percent against the greenback to 111.99 per dollar. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady after its two-day meeting that began Tuesday, as it pauses to examine more economic data, but may hint it is on track for an increase in June. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 11/32 in price to yield 2.2874 percent, from 2.327 percent late on Monday, ahead of the Fed statement on Wednesday. WTI plunged on reports of rising output in the United States and extended losses on technical selling, while Brent crude oil prices fell to the lowest in over five months, erasing all the gains since OPEC agreed to cut production at the end of November. U.S. crude futures pared losses after data showed a bigger-than-expected inventory draw. U.S. crude fell 1.84 percent to $47.94 per barrel and Brent was last at $50.77, down 1.46 percent on the day. Gold touched a three-week low of $1,251.37 an ounce as demand for the safe-haven asset waned. Spot gold was little changed at $1,256.36 an ounce. "

UNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. The (RED) campaign is an example of “cause-related marketing,” a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause.   Cook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. “When we put ourselves into something, it’s worth a lot more than just money,” he said.  (RED) was one of Apple’s highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. "
"2017-10-24",1,"Earnings aside, trading remained timid as investors awaited the next market catalyst: the ECB meeting on Thursday. “The market is anticipating that the ECB highlights some kind of inclination towards lower for longer, and that’s supportive for equities,” said Credit Suisse’s Bose. “If they were a bit more hawkish that could take a bit of the steam out of the rally we’ve seen.” AMS (AMS.S) jumped 22 percent after reporting third-quarter sales just under expectations. Analysts said strong fourth-quarter guidance from the iPhone supplier offset the miss. “With AMS shares down 15 percent in the last month given concerns around the impact from iPhone X delays/constraints, we see solid Q4 guidance as a relief till we get more clarity on iPhone sell-in trends when Apple reports on Nov. 2,” Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Other companies exposed to the iPhone X introduction also gained, with Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) up 2.8 percent and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) up 1.3 percent.   Analysts said overall European company earnings could outperform against forecasts which were revised down ahead of the third-quarter results season.  “Expectations are lower and it will potentially be easier for there to be surprises,” said Pierre Bose, head of European equity strategy at Credit Suisse.  Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Santander (SAN.MC) led Spain’s IBEX higher after Caixa reported the flow of deposits out of the bank had slowed since it moved its headquarters out of Catalonia. Euro zone banks .SX7E rose 1.3 percent, their strongest daily gain in more than a fortnight as Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) also made strong gains. The German lender’s shares jumped 6 percent after sources said it hired Goldman Sachs and Rothschild to help defend against potential takeover bids. Analysts at KBW were skeptical, however. “We continue not to assume any M&A premium for CBK due to regulatory uncertainty and the unattractiveness of the German banking market,” they said in a note, pointing to low return on total equity among German banks. “We doubt that Commerzbank can receive a bid in the next 12-18 months,” they added. Finecobank's (FBK.MI) 6 percent jump after third-quarter results boosted Italy's financials-heavy index .FTMIB by 1.1 percent, outperforming its European peers. In other gainers, oil services group Saipem (SPMI.MI) rose 10.2 percent, set for its best day in 13 months, after reporting a good third-quarter order intake and strong offshore business. German plastics maker Covestro (1COV.DE) jumped 8.6 percent to a record high after reporting a 50 percent increase in third-quarter earnings and a share buyback of up to 1.5 billion euros. Among top fallers, Swedish mining company Boliden (BOL.ST) disappointed investors with third-quarter earnings hit by production disturbances. Its shares dropped 6.6 percent. Randstad (RAND.AS), the world’s second-largest staffing company, slipped 5.2 percent after reporting large one-off costs at Monster Worldwide, the U.S. job hunting portal it acquired last year. "

"2017-09-02",1,"The towering injury-prone Argentine has turned back the clock to rekindle memories of 2009 when he beat Nadal in the semis and Federer in the final to win his only grand slam title and cement a life-long love affair with the Big Apple. “I don’t want too cry this year. I am close,” smiled Del Potro, following a clinical 6-3 6-3 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday. ”I want to play tennis, I had too many problems with my wrist a few years ago and now I have a chance to play here in New York.  “I love this tournament and I love to be here in New York.” There is something about the Flushing Meadows hardcourts, where he has also advanced to the quarter-finals on three occasions, that brings out the best in Del Potro, who swept to straight-sets win over Swiss Henri Laaksonen and Spain’s Adrian Menendez-Maceiras. Federer, who will play his third-round match against Feliciano Lopez later on Saturday, has been forced to go to five sets in his opening two matches while Nadal, who also plays later on Saturday, has been slow to show his best. “But I‘m just doing my own way, and I have a very important match against Dominic (Thiem).” The two have met twice before with Del Potro winning both, including the round of 16 at last year’s U.S. Open when Thiem retired due to injury trailing 6-3 3-2. ”He (Thiem) has everything to win the match,“ said the 24th- seeded Argentine. ”He’s having a great season already. He’s the favourite for the match. ”But I like to play him. I like to play him in this tournament. ”Is very special tournament to me. “I‘m getting good energy from the crowd in every match, and I‘m feeling every day much better with my game.” "
"2017-09-25",4,"”The Presidents Cup has a little bit more of a laid back feel, but I think this one will have more of a Ryder Cup feel,” Fowler, who will be playing on the American team, said in a telephone interview. “It’ll be a little different feeling being in New York. There’s going to be plenty of pressure on players of both sides.” The Presidents Cup, a match play event pitting a 12-man American team against an International side comprised of players from outside Europe, has been a bit of a snooze since its creation in 1994, particularly when played in the United States, where the home team have never lost. But Fowler will not be making any assumptions as he prepares for the showdown at Liberty National in New Jersey, a course framed by the spectacular Manhattan skyline across the river. “The International team is getting better and better,” he said. “It’s by no means a gimme week.” This will be Fowler’s second Presidents Cup. The 28-year-old has participated in three Ryder Cups, dating back to 2010, so experience in team competition is not an issue, but until this year he had not done enough in odd-numbered years to qualify for the Presidents Cup. Fowler qualified for this year’s U.S. team in style by finishing fourth in the points standings, thanks to one victory on the PGA Tour this year, and a string of close calls. While his popularity has translated into big off-course earnings – more than $9 million this year alone according to Golf Digest -- some wonder whether he should say “no” more often to media and sponsor commitments and focus on his game. The ever-polite Fowler, though, says that is not a problem. “It took time to learn to say ‘no’, but golf’s our main focus,” he said. “It’s been a learning curve as far as time commitment. You can’t say ‘no’ to everything.” Florida-based Fowler, a Mercedes-Benz ambassador, enjoys himself when home at his multi-million dollar Jupiter estate, including playing social golf with his regular partner Michael Jordan. He says retired basketball great Jordan, the owner of the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets, is no pushover on the course. “It’s fun to play with a guy who dominated his sport and still has that competitive edge,” Fowler said, adding that Jordan was as competitive as ever, perhaps even more so. Jordan, he said, had an average score of about 80, and could shoot between 70 and 75 on a good day. "

"2016-12-18",-11,"On Monday both Ireland and Apple laid out the legal arguments that would form the basis of their appeals.      “The Commission has manifestly breached its duty to provide a clear and unequivocal statement of reasons in its decision, in relying simultaneously on grossly divergent factual scenarios, in contradicting itself as to the source of the rule that Ireland is said to have breached, and in suggesting that Ireland granted aid in relation to profits taxable in other jurisdictions,” the Irish government said in a statement.  Dublin, which is seeking to protect a tax regime that has helped attract multinational companies that employ around 10 percent of the country’s workforce, listed a number of areas where it believed the commission had misapplied tax rules.  Firstly, it said Apple’s subsidiaries did not receive special treatment in the 1991 and 2007 tax opinions at the center of the case, and that the company’s treatment did not depart from normal taxation, the statement said.  It then said the commission had overstated the level of profits attributable to Apple subsidiaries Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe.  It said important decisions within the companies were made in the United States and the profits derived from these decisions were not properly attributable to them.  “The Commission’s attribution of Apple’s intellectual property licenses to the Irish branches of Apple Operations Europe and Apple Sales International is not consistent with Irish law,” it said. The Irish government said the Commission had incorrectly applied the “arm’s length” principle, according to which individual group members of a multinational enterprise must be taxed on the basis that they act at arm’s length in their dealings with each other. And it said the Commission “failed to act impartially and in accordance with its duty of care” because it did not “clearly explain” its state aid theory during the investigation.   The European Commission is expected to shortly publish a more detailed version of its ruling against Apple.  "
"2016-12-22",-8,"Nokia filed further complaints against Apple on Thursday, saying it had now filed 40 patents suits in 11 countries covering technologies such as displays, software and chipsets. ”Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today’s mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights“, ” Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Nokia patent business said in a statement. Patent royalties represent a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from sales of telecoms network equipment. But the licensing payments are highly profitable at a time when the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump.     “Nokia will likely be granted a better license deal from Apple. But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on Nokia shares.     Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft (MSFT.O) in 2014 and focused on its network business as well as a bulging portfolio of mobile device patents.     Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome.     “The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants,” he wrote in a note to clients. “It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair,” he said, adding Nokia could also “choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S.” Um rates both companies’ shares as “market perform”. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features.  The Finnish firm has forecast the run-rate of its patent and brand licensing sales will be about 950 million euros ($994 million) by the end of 2016, but that it will fall to about 800 million after the Apple deal expires, in the absence of a new one.     Nokia’s total sales in 2016 are expected to top 24 billion euros.  Its shares in Helsinki closed at 4.5 euros, and are down some 30 percent since the start of 2016. In New York Nokia shares (NOK.N) traded down 0.6 percent at 4.73 dollars. "

"2017-07-13",-10,"Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) champion McGregor traded in the stylish suits he wore on the previous two legs of the tour for psychedelic pants and a furry white coat worn over a bare, tattooed chest. He strutted imperiously onto the Barclays Center stage to an Irish ballad and thunderous applause before flexing his muscles, striking poses and rattling off a dance step or two as he waited for the undefeated boxer. It looked for a moment as if the circus was going to take a turn for the worse when McGregor, who addressed the 40-year-old Mayweather as “boy” in Toronto, let a howling crowd know he did not take the charges of racism seriously. “A lot of media have said I am against black people, that’s absolutely ... ridiculous,” McGregor roared. The Irishman, who at times during the earlier stops had appeared to get under Mayweather’s skin, had no such luck in Brooklyn, where the American ignored the jibes and took selfies while McGregor barked in his ear. McGregor is expected to be the aggressor in the ring against the former five-division world champion to make up for his lack of boxing experience and has played that role throughout the tour, which wraps up on Friday with a stop in London. Famous for his knockout power in the MMA cage, McGregor  managed only glancing blows on Thursday as Mayweather, widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters of all-time, side-stepped and returned fired by dubbing McGregor a quitter. While boxing purists have denounced the fight as nothing more than a laughable cashgrab it has nonetheless captured the fascination of many fight fans. McGregor has been the undisputed favorite at each stop on the media tour, and can expect more of the same in London, but few give him any chance in the ring against one of the most skilled and tactically astute boxers of all time. The underdog role is one that fits McGregor like one of his tailored suits, however, and he recalled similar predictions before he beat Jose Aldo to win the UFC featherweight title in late 2015. “They said the same things then as they’re saying now,” he said. ”They said I had no chance. They said I’m in over my head. They said he kicks too hard. Too many weapons.  ”The Irishman is going to fall short, he doesn’t stand a hope.  “It took me 13 seconds.” "

"2016-12-16",-4,"Just how much influence to give such investors has been a hot topic with the rise of activist shareholders who some executives fear may not have long-term corporate interests at heart. At Apple, this debate played out several years ago when billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn successfully urged an increase in share buybacks. Apple, the world’s highest-valued publicly traded company, moved last year to allow a group of up to 20 shareholders owning at least 3 percent of its stock to include their own director candidates, constituting up to 20 percent of the board, in its proxy materials. Thursday’s filing said shareholders also could re-nominate a director candidate regardless of the level of support he or she had won in earlier elections. Previously, shareholders were prohibited from re-nominating candidates who had gotten less than 25 percent at either of the company’s last two annual meetings. Apple also extended a procedural deadline for nominating shareholders and director candidates, and it limited its board’s direction to unilaterally interpret certain provisions, according to the filing. An Apple representative said the company would not comment beyond the filing. Independent shareholder James McRitchie, who has pressed Apple to grant more proxy access rights, said the changes were welcome, especially on the re-nomination question. But he said Apple failed to address two of his other, larger concerns. McRitchie said in a telephone interview that he would prefer there be no limit to the number of investors needed to reach the 3 percent threshold for nominating a director and that the board should change its terms to allow investors to nominate up to two directors to its eight-member board, up from one currently. Both ideas, along with a request to do away with the limits on re-nominations, are in a shareholder proposal McRitchie submitted to the company for a vote at its next annual meeting, expected early next year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October rejected a request by Apple to exclude the proposal. An agency lawyer said officials were “unable to conclude” Apple’s current policies compare favorably with the activists’ submission, as the company had argued, according to correspondence on the SEC’s website.

Hitzinger’s LinkedIn profile states he left Porsche in March and joined a “Technology Company” located in the San Francisco Bay Area as an engineering executive in April. Hitzinger is quoted by Manager Magazin as saying he wanted to do something “which has a significant and direct impact on society”, but did not confirm he now worked at Apple. "

Cellcom is a newcomer to the Israeli television market.  Seeking new streams of revenue, it launched a low price, Internet-based service last year that competes with cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, a subsidiary of Bezeq. Cellcom has now surpassed 100,000 subscribers, still well below YES and HOT. But Cellcom added 12,000 subscribers in the last quarter while the other two services lost clients. “We had a mission to change the TV market,” Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern told a news conference. “This move enables clients to disconnect from the set-top box.

"2017-10-31",-4,"By Sonam Rai and Laharee Chatterjee Oct 31 (Reuters) - Shares in Qualcomm Inc fell as much as 8 percent on Tuesday on reports that Apple Inc would not use its modem chips in iPhones and iPads from next year. Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship took a bad turn earlier this year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The change would affect iPhones released in the fall of 2018, but Apple could still change course before then, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Shares of Intel Corp — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. A number of analysts, however, raised questions about the wisdom of Apple switching from one of its long-time vendors at a time when it has already had to push back the release of its 10th anniversary iPhone X due to issues with new tech. “While Intel’s new modem does support CDMA, it will be their first generation CDMA device, which carries inherent risks,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso told Reuters. Another analyst, Baird Equity’s Tristan Gerra, said the share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years from less than 50 percent currently. “The jury is still out if Apple decides to go in this direction and away from Qualcomm but it would be a potentially game-changing move,” Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights told Reuters. One analyst estimated the annual value of Qualcomm’s share of Apple chips at about $1.5-1.75 billion in revenue compared to the chipmaker’s 2016 revenue of $23.55 billion and Intel’s nearly $60 billion.

"2017-10-02",-4,"* EU to issue guidelines by year-end on patent royalties * Patent holders want rates based on value of final product * Users want fees linked to cost or profit of basic component By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The European Union is drawing up guidelines on how much patent holders should charge for their technologies, a thorny issue that pits Apple and other users against Qualcomm and Ericsson. Trillions of dollars in sales are at stake as regulators ponder whether a fridge maker should pay a different rate for crucial patents than a carmaker, or whether a flat, fixed rate would be fairer. The patent fee model used by world No. 1 smartphone chip designer Qualcomm predominates in the tech industry and is based on how much value a technology adds to a product, but is opposed by Apple and others in Silicon Valley. Other models are in use and the EU aims to set a uniform one for Europe, opening a new front in a global dispute that has already seen multiple lawsuits between Apple and Qualcomm. Antti Peltomaki, deputy director general at the European Commission, told a conference last week that the EU hopes to finalise its guidelines by the end of the year. They will not be legally binding but could provide a basis if the EU executive decides to enact rules in future. The move is part of the bloc’s broader push to set new rules of the road for internet-connected devices beyond just computers and smartphones to cover cars, home automation and energy devices, aiming to ensure job creation and other economic benefits in the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) era. Qualcomm’s patent fee model is based on the widely used so-called “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” (FRAND) licensing model. The European Commission, however, has yet to make a final decision on which technology patent fee model it favours. Silicon Valley tech giants have sided with Apple, as have big Asian electronics makers who work for Apple, including Foxconn Technology Group. Qualcomm, which holds what many experts see as the world's most lucrative smartphone patent portfolio, is backed by major mobile phone and network patent holders Ericsson and Nokia . (reut.rs/2yzqvCc) Apple, the automotive industry and product makers say a fairer approach is to link royalties to the cost of the smallest saleable unit. “It is not reasonable to charge more for use of the very same component in a Mercedes versus a Hyundai or a car versus a bicycle. This is discriminatory based on price of the end product, both within and outside of a particular product category,” Apple said of Qualcomm’s model in a May submission to the European Commission. Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment for this story. Industry estimates show IoT systems could represent a market of more than $11 trillion per year by 2025. “There’s a lot of potential value at stake,” said Matthew Hunt, competition attorney with the law firm Bristows in London. Ericsson, once the world’s biggest mobile phone and network equipment maker, has fallen on hard times in the past decade in the face of stiff global competition. Still, with more than 42,000 patents giving it the largest number of mobile technology patents, it stands by the value-based licensing model. “We need to be able to be flexible to differentiate the price. Flexibility is absolutely necessary,” Patrick Hofkens, Ericsson’s director of intellectual property rights policy, said. Hofkens said that charging high royalty rates discourages product makers from adopting new innovations, while setting royalty rates too low undermines new technology developers from licensing their patents to industry standards bodies, which enable mass markets to take off. “Price differentiation allows for lower prices for applications that do not use the patented technology as intensively as others,” the Ericsson executive said. The European Commission has a tough balancing act, said Bristows’ Hunt. “For any model, the main difficulty is going to be how to determine a fair rate. This has proven complicated enough in the mobile telecoms industry already, and it’s only going to get harder with new IoT enabled products,” he said. Qualcomm’s approach sets royalty rates based on the proportion of ‘added value’ the patented technology provides to the completed product. Its previous patent licensing deal with Apple, for example, allowed it to take a percentage of the overall selling price for the iPhone, in exchange for supplying it with modem chips. Lobbying group the App Association (ACT), whose sponsors include Apple, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft , urged the Commission not to rush into setting new guidelines. IP Europe, another lobbying group whose members include Ericsson, Airbus, Nokia and Orange , says patent holders deserve a fair compensation. “When they are contributors to a platform, they have expectations of fair remuneration,” the group’s executive secretary Francisco Mingorance said.

Qualcomm forecast adjusted profit of 75 cents to 85 cents per share and revenue of $5.4 billion to 6.2 billion for the current quarter. The company said the forecast excluded licensing revenue  related to the sale of Apple products by contract manufacturers as well as the other unnamed licensee in dispute. Analysts were expecting an adjusted profit of 90 cents per share and revenue of $5.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “(Forecast) is pretty strong on the revenue front... the chip business is looking good especially in China, where it is getting pretty good traction with Chinese manufacturers,” Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger said.

Traders said their shares were under pressure because Apple’s new $999 iPhone X will ship later than expected, on November 3. The price tag could also dent demand for the device in markets such as China. “With the iPhone coming in around $1,000 it will be interesting to see how healthy demand is,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  “If it’s relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and that consumers have confidence.” Chipmakers have been the best performing among Europe’s tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector’s outperformance.

It said its report, published on Gotham City’s website, was based on publicly available information and field research. “The Board vigorously denies the allegations in the report and considers the information contained therein to be inaccurate and misleading,” AAC Chairman Koh Boon Hwee said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. AAC said it has released all necessary information to the market and was seeking legal advice on the matter. Citi analyst Dennis Chan said the Gotham City report did not change its positive view on AAC, adding that it was one of only three acoustic component suppliers to Apple and had much better pricing power than other suppliers to the U.S. tech giant. “Our first take is there doesn’t appear to be enough evidence for these allegations,” said Jefferies analyst Rex Wu. The company’s stock fell by as much as 14 percent to an intraday low of HK$96. The benchmark Hang Seng Index, traded flat. Shenzhen-based AAC is a maker of miniaturized acoustic components including speaker boxes, speakers, receivers and microphones. Apple is one of its main clients. AAC is expected to report first quarter earnings on Friday after market close. Nine analysts, polled by Thomson Reuters before the Gotham City report, gave a median forecast for AAC’s net profit of 1 billion yuan ($144.88 million) on revenue of 4.1 billion yuan. AAC in March reported a net profit of 4.03 billion yuan in 2016, up 29.6 percent from the previous year. It had a net profit margin of 26 percent.  The group was founded in Shenzhen in 1993 by current CEO Benjamin Zhengming Pan and his wife Ingrid Chunyuan Wu, a non-executive director, who together own 40.34 percent of the stock, according to AAC’s annual report.

"2017-11-09",4,"Settling might make the $70-per-share bid less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed a lower rate of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that’s worth about $16 billion – or roughly $11 per share. And that’s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back. Should Apple play along? It depends who the $905 billion smartphone maker thinks is a more malleable counterpart. Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan is open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should it prevail, according to people familiar with its thinking. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of boss Tim Cook might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant. Whatever Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Tan could negotiate properly anyway. The maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable."

According to Reuters checks on Wednesday morning, Skype was not available in app stores in China overseen by Apple, Tencent Holdings Ltd 00700.HK and Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd QIHUy.SG. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google Play app store is not available in China. Microsoft, Tencent and Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China has increased scrutiny of internet applications this year, ordering firms to remove hundreds of apps that allow users to communicate confidentially or get around China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship and use overseas social media. Cyber authorities have also periodically interrupted services, such as Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) encrypted messenger app Whatsapp over the last two months. The authorities said such actions are designed to protect personal privacy and prevent online terrorist activity. Foreign tech lobbies and businesses operating in China have said internet rules are too strict and could hit their local operations. The actions are linked to real name authentication laws brought in earlier this year, requiring all network providers to verify the real names of users with state-issued IDs or passports. Separate data regulations also require companies to store user information within China, and make it accessible to authorities for surveillance purposes. Some foreign firms, including Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple have this year handed of parts of their business to local affiliates, often citing compliance with the new cybersecurity laws. Unlike similar services that are blocked, including Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Skype’s services are still available for those who already have the app installed.

The Nikkei ended flat at 22,011.67, after hitting a fresh 21-year high of 22,086.88 in early trade. “Ahead of major economic events in the Japanese and global markets this week, investors are a bit cautious,” said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.

Surges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year.

The Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower at 20,029.26 points. “The Japanese market rose ahead of U.S. markets after Apple’s earnings so investors were quick to lock in gains,” said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The Dow climbed above the 22,000 mark overnight for the first time, buoyed by Apple Inc’s healthy quarterly iPhone sales. But other tech stocks such as Applied Materials fell, while Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index dropped 0.7 percent. “Although Apple surged overnight, other U.S. tech stocks were weak, and that’s why investors quickly decided that the overall market would not continue to benefit from ‘the Apple effect’ and Japanese companies like Tokyo Electron fell today,” Fujito added. Chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd shed 2.4 percent, while Advantest Corp stumbled 2.9 percent. Bucking the trend, ANA Holdings Inc soared 5.4 percent after Japan’s biggest airline by revenue said its first-quarter operating profit rose 80 percent due to brisk business on international routes and after taking control of low-cost arm Peach Aviation Ltd. Market reaction was muted to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s reshuffle of his cabinet on Thursday, as he attempts to regain public support hurt by a series of scandals. “The correlation between opinion polls and Japanese stocks is seen weak for now,” said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, adding that unless Abe’s support rate declined sharply from the current level, the impact from political developments on the Japanese market should be limited. Abe had until recently been seen as likely to win a third term as head of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), guaranteeing him the premiership and putting him on track to be Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. But his support has fallen below 30 percent in the recent polls, hit by opposition-fanned suspicions of Abe’s favouritism to a friend, as well as voter perceptions that he and his aides have grown arrogant in office.

Qualcomm forecast adjusted profit of 75 cents to 85 cents per share and revenue of $5.4 billion to 6.2 billion for the current quarter.

"2016-12-03",-1,"A five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. Some analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. In  September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc  and General Motors Co. Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. An auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

"2017-10-27",4,"The mix outperformed Clorox-spiked water for getting rid of the chemicals, and also worked better than plain water, Dr. Lili He of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and her colleagues found. They reported their findings October 25 in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Pesticides are widely used in agriculture to kill bugs, fungi and other produce-plaguing pests. They can hurt humans, too, but most of us are exposed to amounts so tiny that they don’t pose a risk, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Many people try to limit their exposure to pesticides by washing produce, but whether or not this does anything to remove them has not been studied, Dr. He and her team note. They coated apples with thiabendazole, a fungicide, or phosmet, which is used to kill a variety of pests, and washed them with water or water mixed with bleach or baking soda. The researchers used Gala apples because they are widely consumed and also likely to contain a wide variety of pesticides. Using super-sensitive, high-tech tests, the researchers checked on and within the apple for pesticides and measured pesticide concentration within plant tissue. Rinsing the fruit in the baking soda solution for 12 minutes was most effective for removing thiabendazole, they found, while a 15-minute baking soda rinse was most effective for getting rid of phosmet. Some of the pesticide passed beyond the apple’s surface, with thiabendazole going four times deeper than phosmet. None of the washing methods could fully remove the residue.  After harvest, the EPA requires apple producers to soak the fruit for two minutes in bleach mixed with water. The quick dip is intended to remove bacteria and other organic matter, not to wash off pesticides, Dr. He noted in a telephone interview with Reuters Health, but it would be ideal to find a post-harvest treatment that would do both. The baking soda solution is likely more effective because it can help break apart pesticide molecules, the researcher said, and can be used for washing other types of produce.  How well it works “depends on the structure of the fruits and vegetables, but it’s a general method,” she added. Dr. He and her colleagues used a concentration of about one teaspoon of baking soda per two cups of water. But, she said, “You don’t need to be precise, just adding a little bit is better than not adding it.”  While deeper-penetrating pesticides could be removed by peeling an apple, the researcher said, this would mean missing out on the nutrient-rich skin. “It’s always been a two-sided story.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2lmjFOC Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, online October 25, 2017."

If economic data was worse than what it is, then I’d be worried,” he said. “The risk of recession is still pretty low, so I think this (tech) selloff is not a harbinger.” Jacobsen said he would not yet buy into the market’s dip ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday, as the Fed is “the biggest risk to the market” in the near-term. “If the Fed dismisses the recent bout of soft data and continues hiking (rates) for the sake of hiking, then we could see a correction” in the stock market, he said. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Under Armour (UAA.N), which rose 5.8 percent, while the largest decliner was Netflix (NFLX.O), down 4.2 percent. Coherus BioSciences (CHRS.O) tumbled 23.8 percent to $15.73 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen’s (AMGN.O) Neulasta. Amgen edged up 0.5 percent to $164.88. Advancing issues barely outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.89 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, far above the 6.81 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. "
"2017-09-13",-1,"* Apple suppliers dent European shares as rally flags * Dollar extends gains, inflation data eyed * Oil rises as IEA forecast overshadows U.S. crude build By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged lower on Wednesday, pulled down over concerns about the launch of Apple’s new iPhone X, while the dollar rose after a report showed U.S. producer prices rebounded in August, suggesting a strong economy. The yield on European and U.S. government debt rose, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting a 2-1/2 week high. Oil prices rose after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a global surplus was starting to shrink, even as U.S. data showed another surge in crude inventories due to the ongoing impact from Hurricane Harvey on the energy complex. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed but a gauge of more than 2,400 stocks worldwide edged lower after setting consecutive closing record highs the past three sessions. European equities pared earlier losses to edge higher thanks to gains in oil and banking stocks, which offset weak chipmakers and a fall in miners. Chipmakers in Europe that supply Apple were among the worst performers, with AMS down 3.9 percent and Dialog Semiconductor off 1.6 percent. STMicro ended up 0.1 percent. Chipmakers have been the best-performing among Europe’s tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector’s outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. MSCI’s all-country world stock index shed 0.2 percent, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.02 percent and the Euro STOXX 50 rose 0.3 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.16 points, or 0.09 percent, to 22,138.02. he S&P 500 lost 0.17 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,496.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.22 points, or 0 percent, to 6,454.50. The launch of Apple’s iPhone X will test whether inflation is going to be weak as investors gauge demand for a product whose price starts at $999, said Mike Bell, global markets strategist with JP Morgan Asset Management in London. “If it’s relatively healthy, I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and consumers have confidence,” Bell said. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.69 percent at 92.512. The index rose after the U.S. Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent in August after slipping 0.1 percent in July. The rebound was driven by a surge in the cost of gasoline. The euro fell 0.75 percent to $1.1875 while the Japanese yen weakened 0.44 percent versus the greenback at 110.64 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.1953 percent. Their German counterpart, 10 year Bunds, rose 3 basis points in price to yield 0.404 percent. Oil prices jumped after the IEA report but then pared gains. U.S. crude rose $1.07 to settle at $49.30 per barrel and Brent rose 89 cents to settle at $55.16 a barrel. “A sharp rebound in U.S. oil production compared with last week has limited gains in crude prices as concerns grow that oil output is recovering faster than refining capacity coming online,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

"2016-11-14",-5,"Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers.  The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week. "
"2017-08-30",-4,"Berkshire has disclosed a roughly $20 billion stake in Apple. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM at the end of 2016 and sold about a third of them in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported in May, citing Buffett.  Buffett also said Wednesday that he continued to have faith in investments in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo. Berkshire has become Bank of America’s largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. When asked if U.S. food company Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) would buy Mondelez (MDLZ.O), Buffett said: “I think the answer is no on that.” He also said Kraft Heinz, which Berkshire controls along with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, would not again seek to buy Unilever Plc (ULVR.L).  Kraft Heinz withdrew its proposal for a $143 billion merger with larger rival Unilever Plc, the companies said in February. Following a six-month cooling off period required by UK takeover law which expired this month, there has been speculation over whether Kraft Heinz would come back for another shot at Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.  “That was a misunderstanding, basically. We will not make hostile takeover offers, and we did not intend that to be hostile, but it turned out it was, and we immediately the next day, when I learned about it, we called it off,” Buffett said on Kraft Heinz’s bid.  When asked why he was silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, Buffett said: “I am not in the business of attacking any president, nor do I think I should be.” He had supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election.

The lenders have been demanding that Toshiba sign a definitive agreement with the Bain-led group, which also involves South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), as a condition for the funding. Details of the issues with Apple couldn’t immediately be ascertained. Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters: “While we cannot comment on the detail of the deal procedure, we aim to sign the agreement with the purchaser as early as possible.” Apple didn’t immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.

"2017-08-02",-9,"* Correlation between opinion polls and Japan stocks is weak - analyst By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell on Thursday as investors wasted little time taking profits in tech shares which rose the previous day after Apple posted strong quarterly earnings. The Nikkei dropped 0.4 percent to 20,003.17 points by mid-morning, after rising 0.5 percent on Wednesday. “The Japanese market rose ahead of U.S. markets after Apple’s earnings so investors were quick to lock in gains,” said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The Dow climbed above the 22,000 mark overnight for the first time, buoyed by Apple Inc’s healthy quarterly iPhone sales. But other tech stocks such as Applied Materials fell 3.1 percent, while Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index dropped 0.7 percent. “Although Apple surged overnight, other U.S. tech stocks were weak, and that’s why investors quickly decided that the overall market would not continue to benefit from ‘the Apple effect’ and Japanese companies like Tokyo Electron fell today,” Fujito added. Chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd shed 2.0 percent, while Advantest Corp stumbled 3.6 percent. Apple suppliers which rose on the previous day languished as well. Murata Manufacturing dropped 0.5 percent and TDK shed 0.4 percent. Bucking the trend, ANA Holdings Inc soared 4.5 percent after Japan’s biggest airline by revenue said first-quarter operating profit rose 80 percent due to brisk business on international routes and after taking control of low-cost arm Peach Aviation Ltd. Traders were also awaiting an expected cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later in the day as he attempts to regain public support hurt by a series of scandals. “The correlation between opinion polls and Japanese stocks is seen weak for now,” said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, adding that unless Abe’s support rate declined sharply from the current level, the impact from political developments should be limited on the Japanese market. Abe had until recently been seen as likely to win a third term as head of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and thus the premiership, putting him on track to be Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. But support has fallen below 30 percent in the recent polls, hit by opposition-fanned suspicions of Abe’s favouritism to a friend, as well as voter perceptions that he and his aides have grown arrogant in office.

"2016-12-03",-1,"“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. Some analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. Apple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. In  September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N). Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. An auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

The department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013. Regulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant’s existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste. The regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste. "

In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case. The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments.

Shares of Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, rose 2.8 percent as shoppers streamed into the company’s stores to buy its latest iPhone. Apple also gave a better-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping season. U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, the Labor Department said. But wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will continue to undershoot the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target. “It kind of confirms this Goldilocks-type scenario where it’s steady growth with really not a lot of inflationary pressure,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.93 points, or 0.11 percent, to 23,543.19, the S&P 500 gained 8.28 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,588.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.96 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,763.90. Apple was easily the biggest individual boost to the three indexes. The stock also helped boost the tech sector, which climbed 0.9 percent and led all major S&P 500 groups. All three indexes were on track to record gains for the week, which saw a series of significant events, including the appointment of a new Fed chair and the long-awaited unveiling of a tax-cut bill from U.S. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans. Third-quarter corporate reports also have continued at a heavy pace. With more than 400 of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings for the quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared to an expectation of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American International Group shares sank 4.8 percent as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giant’s reserves. Starbucks shares rose 2.3 percent following results.

With Apple’s latest models now on the market, Huawei has weighed in with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, featuring, respectively, 5.9-inch and 6-inch edge-to-edge displays, as well as fast-charging batteries that sustain two days of heavy use.     “The Mate 10 line ticks all the boxes in terms of screen size, high-quality camera, powerful processor and slick design - competing with rival products from Samsung and to some extent, Apple,” said CCS Insight mobile analyst Ben Wood. Perhaps the most distinctive features of the Mate 10 series is its image recognition capability -- an artificial intelligence feature that can tell the difference between people, flowers or other objects in different light or weather conditions. The Mate 10 also boasts cameras with high-grade Leica f1.6 aperture lenses. “We have the ability to start helping the novice become a professional-grade photographer,” Peter Gauden, a senior Huawei product marketing manager, said at an advance product briefing. “(It) is not only a smartphone, it is an intelligent machine.”     Though it has become more focused on mid-tier and premium phones and reduced its appetite for market share at any cost, it still has a long way to go.

Those modest margins put a cap on how far Huawei can go with further discounting.

"2017-10-02",-3,"Trillions of dollars in sales are at stake as regulators ponder whether a fridge maker should pay a different rate for crucial patents than a carmaker, or whether a flat, fixed rate would be fairer. The patent fee model used by world No. 1 smartphone chip designer Qualcomm predominates in the tech industry and is based on how much value a technology adds to a product, but is opposed by Apple and others in Silicon Valley. Other models are in use and the EU aims to set a uniform one for Europe, opening a new front in a global dispute that has already seen multiple lawsuits between Apple and Qualcomm. Antti Peltomaki, deputy director general at the European Commission, told a conference last week that the EU hopes to finalise its guidelines by the end of the year. They will not be legally binding but could provide a basis if the EU executive decides to enact rules in future. The move is part of the bloc’s broader push to set new rules of the road for internet-connected devices beyond just computers and smartphones to cover cars, home automation and energy devices, aiming to ensure job creation and other economic benefits in the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) era. Qualcomm’s patent fee model is based on the widely used so-called “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” (FRAND) licensing model. The European Commission, however, has yet to make a final decision on which technology patent fee model it favours. Silicon Valley tech giants have sided with Apple, as have big Asian electronics makers who work for Apple, including Foxconn Technology Group.  Qualcomm, which holds what many experts see as the world's most lucrative smartphone patent portfolio, is backed by major mobile phone and network patent holders Ericsson and Nokia. (reut.rs/2yzqvCc) Apple, the automotive industry and product makers say a fairer approach is to link royalties to the cost of the smallest saleable unit. “It is not reasonable to charge more for use of the very same component in a Mercedes versus a Hyundai or a car versus a bicycle. This is discriminatory based on price of the end product, both within and outside of a particular product category,” Apple said of Qualcomm’s model in a May submission to the European Commission.  Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment for this story. Industry estimates show IoT systems could represent a market of more than $11 trillion per year by 2025. “There’s a lot of potential value at stake,” said Matthew Hunt, competition attorney with the law firm Bristows in London. Ericsson, once the world’s biggest mobile phone and network equipment maker, has fallen on hard times in the past decade in the face of stiff global competition. Still, with more than 42,000 patents giving it the largest number of mobile technology patents, it stands by the value-based licensing model. “We need to be able to be flexible to differentiate the price. Flexibility is absolutely necessary,” Patrick Hofkens, Ericsson’s director of intellectual property rights policy, said. Hofkens said that charging high royalty rates discourages product makers from adopting new innovations, while setting royalty rates too low undermines new technology developers from licensing their patents to industry standards bodies, which enable mass markets to take off.     “Price differentiation allows for lower prices for applications that do not use the patented technology as intensively as others,” the Ericsson executive said. The European Commission has a tough balancing act, said Bristows’ Hunt. “For any model, the main difficulty is going to be how to determine a fair rate. This has proven complicated enough in the mobile telecoms industry already, and it’s only going to get harder with new IoT enabled products,” he said.  Qualcomm’s approach sets royalty rates based on the proportion of ‘added value’ the patented technology provides to the completed product.   Its previous patent licensing deal with Apple, for example, allowed it to take a percentage of the overall selling price for the iPhone, in exchange for supplying it with modem chips. Lobbying group the App Association (ACT), whose sponsors include Apple, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft, urged the Commission not to rush into setting new guidelines.  IP Europe, another lobbying group whose members include Ericsson, Airbus, Nokia and Orange, says patent holders deserve a fair compensation. “When they are contributors to a platform, they have expectations of fair remuneration,” the group’s executive secretary Francisco Mingorance said."
"2017-07-26",-7,"The liquid crystal display manufacturer has tapped Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, the source said, adding that the creditors were willing to extend the loan if it was guaranteed by INCJ. The source declined to be identified as talks on the matter were private. Officials at Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and INCJ declined to comment while a representative for SMBC was not immediately available for comment. The request was first reported by the Nikkei business daily. It said INCJ would provide the guarantees and that further restructuring may involve halting production at its smartphone panel plants in the central Japanese city of Nomi and China’s Jiangsu Province as well as cutting several hundred jobs through an early retirement offer. Japan Display said in a statement it was looking at implementing drastic steps to reshape itself amid shifting market conditions. “We will make an announcement when we reach a decision,” it said. INCJ helped form Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp five years ago, but government intervention has so far failed to result in putting the firm on a solid business. Apple is widely tipped to adopt OLED displays, which are thinner and more flexible than LCD screens, for its iPhone 8 expected in the second half of 2017, and Japan Display’s lack of a presence in that segment of the market has put it at a major disadvantage. INCJ’s role in rescuing Japan’s struggling tech industry could intensify as it is expected to play a major role in groups that are the front-runners for Toshiba’s sale of its $18 billion chip business. Japan Display’s shares were flat at the end of the morning session, in line with the broader market. "

"2017-09-02",0,"Huawei will launch the Mate 10 and its sister phone, the Mate 10 Pro, in Munich on Oct. 16, Yu confirmed. He declined to detail new features, but the phones are expected to boast large, 6-inch-plus full-screen displays, tech blogs predict. Artificial intelligence (AI) built into its new chips can help make phones more personalized, or anticipate the actions and interests of their users, Yu said. As examples, he said AI can enable real-time language translation, heed voice commands, or take advantage of augmented reality, which overlays text, sounds, graphics and video on real-world images phone users see in front of them. Yu believes the new Kirin 970 chip’s speed and low power can translate into features that will give its phones an edge over the Apple iPhone 8 series, set to be unveiled on Sept. 12, and Samsung’s range of top-line phones announced this year. Huawei is the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple. “Compared with Samsung and Apple, we have advantages,” Yu said in an interview during the annual IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. “Users are in for much faster (feature) performance, longer battery life and more compact design.” The company asserts its newly announced Kirin 970 chip will preserve battery life on phones by up to 50 percent. Huawei describes the new chip as the first Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for smartphones. It brings together classic computing, graphics, image and digital signal processing power that have typically required separate chips, taking up more space and slowing interaction between features within phones. Most importantly, Huawei aims to use the Kirin chips to differentiate its phones from a vast sea of competitors, including Samsung, who overwhelming rely on rival Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm, the market leader in mobile chip design. Among major phone makers, only Apple and Huawei now rely on their own core processors. The 970 is designed by Huawei’s HiSilicon chip design business and built using the most advanced 10 nanometer production lines of contract manufacturer TSMC.

AAC said it has released all necessary information to the market and was seeking legal advice on the matter. Citi analyst Dennis Chan said the Gotham City report did not change its positive view on AAC, adding that it was one of only three acoustic component suppliers to Apple and had much better pricing power than other suppliers to the U.S. tech giant. “Our first take is there doesn’t appear to be enough evidence for these allegations,” said Jefferies analyst Rex Wu.

Apple fell as much 2.8 percent as signs of poor demand for iPhone 8 raised doubts about the company’s double 2017 iPhone release strategy. The other high-flying FAANG stocks - Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix - were down between 0.86 percent and 1.03 percent. “Apple has its impact across the board,” said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “The marketing plan here was not a lot to be desired, considering you have two phones and the next one is just two weeks away from release. If it’s going to be a significant upgrade, it did not make any sense to me.” There is also profit-taking in the tech sector, Blancato said. Technology sector has had a strong run so far, gaining more than 30 percent and helping the three major indexes scale record highs. At 11:07 a.m. ET (1507 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44.33 points, or 0.19 percent, at 23,113.27, the S&P 500 was down 5.07 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,556.19 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 34.78 points, or 0.53 percent, at 6,589.44. The retreat from record levels comes on a day that marks the 30th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Six of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with gains mostly in the defensive utilities, telecoms sectors. Healthcare stocks also gained, boosted by a 5.8 percent rise in the shares of medical equipment maker Danaher. Verizon’s 2.45 percent rise on strong quarterly earnings lifted telecom stocks, including AT&T. The financial index dropped 0.46 percent, led by losses in Bank of New York Mellon and KeyCorp. United Airlines sank 5.12 percent, weighing on other airlines stocks and the Dow Jones Transport index, after the third largest U.S. carrier’s profit fell due to flight cancellations during the hurricane season.

The internet regulator did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the Times’ apps.  “The development of the internet in China must respect China’s laws and regulations, in principle,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in response to a question about the apps.  New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told Reuters that the newspaper has asked Apple to reconsider.  “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country,” Murphy said.  The government has blocked the Times’ websites since 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth of the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the New York Times reported.  An Apple spokeswoman in China declined to comment on specific reasons or which regulatory body made the request.  Apps from other international publications whose websites are blocked, including CNN, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, were still available on Thursday.  Chinese mainstream media has not reported the app removal but it was discussed widely on social media.  “This must be coming from the request of The Wall right?” said one user on microblogging service Weibo, referring to state-backed internet censorship. “Apple has made enough money in China, it’s OK for it to take the blame this time for the sake of the money.”  Other users said they would attempt to change their country of residence within the app store to restore access.

Shares in the world’s most valuable company surged 6 percent after-hours to a record of more than $159, taking its market capitalisation above $830 billion. That should help carry the Dow through the 22,000 mark when trading resumes in New York. E-Mini futures for the Dow were up 0.2 percent, while Eurostoxx 50 futures added 0.1 percent. The tech giant reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, revenue and earnings per share and signalled its upcoming 10th-anniversary phone is on schedule. Among Apple suppliers, LG Innnotek jumped 10 percent and SK Hynix, the world’s second-biggest memory chip maker, rose 3.8 percent. Murata Manufacturing firmed 4.9 percent and Taiyo Yuden 4.4 percent, helping the Nikkei up 0.47 percent. The MSCI tech index for Asia climbed 0.9 percent to ground not trod since early 2000, bringing its gains for the year to a heady 40 percent. Those gains balanced losses in basic materials and energy to leave MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan steady near its highest since late 2007. There was a note of caution over reports U.S. President Donald Trump was close to a decision on how to respond to what he considers China’s unfair trade practices. Tepid U.S. inflation along with political turmoil in Washington has lessened the risk of another Federal Reserve rate hike this year, lowering bond yields across the globe. Improving data in other major economies has also served to push the greenback down nearly 11 percent from January peaks, benefiting commodities and emerging markets. A swathe of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) out on Tuesday underlined how the improvement in activity had broadened out from the United States to Asia and Europe. “That will do nothing to hurt ebullient global risk appetite,” said Ruskin. “This phase of the risk rally is based on growth data, but even more on subdued inflation measures.” “The latter plays to a gradual Central Bank exit from extreme policy accommodation that should prolong the global growth cycle.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe has scored its longest monthly winning streak in over a decade. On Wall Street, the Dow ended Tuesday with gains of 0.33 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.24 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.23 percent. In currency markets, the dollar steadied above deep lows though thanks mainly to positioning - bears are already so short of the currency that they are wary of selling even more. The dollar index was stuck at 93.052, after touching 92.777, the lowest since early May 2016. It was aided by gains on a softer yen which saw it creep to 110.80. Yet the euro also benefited from buying against the yen , reaching its highest since February last year. It edged up 0.2 percent on the dollar to $1.1827 and back toward the 2-1/2-year high of $1.1845 struck on Monday. Oil prices were under pressure again amid rising U.S. fuel inventories and as major world producers kept pumping, causing investors to worry that several weeks of steady gains had pushed the rally too far.

"2017-07-27",-6,"“We are actually taking some share in the market ... early signs look quite promising in terms of market share development,” Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a conference call. Telecom equipment suppliers have struggled in recent years amid weak demand from telecom companies, but Nokia said it had won markets thanks to its broader product portfolio following its 2016 acquisition of rival Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia’s profit growth is in stark contrast to loss-making Swedish rival Ericsson, which stunned investors this year by announcing $1.7 billion in provisions, writedowns and restructuring costs. Demand for the current generation of faster 4G mobile broadband equipment has peaked, so equipment vendors are now waiting for telecoms firms to upgrade to next-generation 5G equipment, which Suri said would become “meaningful” in 2019. Nokia bought Alcatel-Lucent in a $15.6 billion deal which gave it a larger fixed-line network business and made it less dependent on mobile broadband. The deal also helped it launch new router products aimed at internet giants. Another major rival, China’s Huawei, which is also a major phone manufacturer, reported a 15 percent rise in its half-year sales on Thursday, but it did not break down profits for its networks business. Huawei has previously signaled it would scale back its aggressive price competition to strengthen overall profits. “We now expect a decline in the market in the range of 3-5 percent, versus our earlier view of a low-single digit decline,” Suri said. Nokia’s network business, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of its sales, is set to decline in 2017 in line with the market trend. However, Nokia reiterated its full-year operating margin forecast of 8 percent to 10 percent for the business. “Weakening of the general market outlook is a clear minus. But Nokia’s profitability shows they are able to deliver good results in weak markets,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on the stock. Nokia’s second-quarter network sales fell 5 percent from a year earlier but total sales only decreased 1 percent to 5.63 billion euros, helped by a boost in licensing royalties thanks to a deal with Apple to settling a patent dispute. Suri said Nokia was stepping up spending on research and development, saying he saw a bigger 5G market taking shape than the company had envisioned as recently as last year. “We think that 5G will likely last longer and be deeper than first thought,” Suri said. “5G trials will accelerate in 2018 and, in 2019, we can expect to see meaningful deployment in the U.S., China and potentially other markets like Japan.” Once the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, Nokia was caught out by the rise of smartphones and ended up selling the handset business to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it with the networks business and a portfolio of technology patents.

JPMorgan and Bank of America shares led the advancers on the S&P financial, both rising 1.5 percent as they tracked a climb in U.S. Treasury yields which benefits banks. The financial index was on track to post its first gain in four days after concerns about weak trading and credit card losses outweighed better-than-forecast earnings for big Wall Street banks. Technology stocks also gained led by a 1.5 percent rise in Apple shares following a bullish brokerage call on the iPhone maker.

The Republicans want to use the “budget resolution” to pave the way for the party later this year or next year to pass a major tax-cut bill without any Democratic support.

Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 0.93 percent gain in the telecom services index. Healthcare stocks were the biggest laggard, weighed down by a 2 percent fall in Bristol-Myers Squibb. Shares of health insurers and hospital operators also slipped after U.S. President Donald Trump said Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working on a short-term fix for healthcare insurance markets after he last week scrapped subsidies to insurers. Adobe fell 2.49 percent after Deutsche Bank cut rating on the Photoshop maker’s stock to “hold”.

Europe’s STOXX 600 index was flat in percentage terms at its close, having spent most of the session in negative territory. Shares in several Apple suppliers fell after the smartphone giant reported a surprise dip in sales of its flagship iPhone. Dialog Semiconductor shares slid 2.5 percent. They had plummeted 14 percent in April on fears over Apple bringing some of its components in-house. “Dialog has been trying to diversify for a number of years to different sources, but unfortunately if your key relationship is with Apple and that’s because you have got great products, there’s risk and opportunity very closely aligned in that,” said Neil Campling, technology analyst at Northern Trust.

Shares in German luxury retailer Hugo Boss dropped nearly 3 percent after online sales fell 27 percent due to fewer visitors to its website. German bluechip automakers Daimler and BMW were also on the back foot after disappointing April auto sales in the U.S. Gains among healthcare stocks supported Germany’s DAX index, which rose 0.2 percent and touched a fresh all-time high. Fresenius hit a record high, up 2.6 percent, after it raised its 2017 profit forecast after demand for its generic infusion drugs boosted first-quarter income 28 percent. “We do not believe investors were anticipating another guidance raise and will be relieved by the Kabi strength,” said UBS analysts, referring to the company’s infusion segment. Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk jumped to the top of the STOXX 600, up 6.8 percent after it beat estimates for first-quarter profit and nudged up its full-year outlook. Elsewhere, underwhelming results weighed on Finland’s Nokian Tyres, down 5.7 percent after it missed estimates for operating profit. Centamin sank nearly 6 percent after posting a 28-percent fall in first-quarter pretax profit. It dragged Europe’s miners down 2.5 percent to a four-month low. European first-quarter earnings are expected to increase 10.5 percent from the first quarter of 2016, or 6.2 percent excluding the energy sector, Thomson Reuters data showed.

"2017-10-24",-2,"Shares in the Swiss-listed company, which supplies optical sensors that help adjust the brightness and colors on phone  screens, were up nearly 18 percent at 77.25 Swiss francs at 1012 GMT, having hit a record high of 80 francs earlier in the session and boosting gains this year to nearly 170 percent. “As the first of the European and U.S. semi (conductor) names with significant Apple exposure to report, we expect AMS’s guidance and commentary to provide relief not only for its own shares but also for the Apple food chain at large,” Barclays analysts said in a note. Shares in other European Apple suppliers Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) rose 2-4 percent after a poor run last week, when reports of a slowdown in demand for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus emerged. “We are implementing the expected steep ramps (up in) of new optical solutions for a recently launched global platform by a leading smartphone OEM,” AMS said in a statement. Credit Suisse analysts said they believed AMS was talking about iPhone X’s 3D sensing capability that could unlock the phone through 3D facial recognition. Late on Monday AMS had said in reporting third-quarter results that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to come in at between 440 million euros  and 480 million euros  ($517-564 million), well above the 393 million euros predicted on average by analysts. It had previously expected current quarter revenues to increase in line with the 45 percent quarter-over-quarter growth seen in the third quarter. The mid-point of the latest forecast would put sequential growth at 75 percent. Bryan Garnier analyst Dorian Terral said the outlook was “reassuring”, as there had been rumors about potential delays in the build-up in production of the iPhone X. "

Lines formed outside Apple stores around the world as fans flocked to buy the iPhone X, helping allay concerns that supply issues might stop the company from satisfying early demand. The shares jumped as much as 3.7 percent and helped Apple briefly surpass $900 billion in market capitalization. The market traded in a narrow range after October jobs data triggered worries about weak wage growth. Average hourly earnings slipped by one cent last month, lowering the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent. U.S. jobs increased by 261,000 last month after a hurricane-ravaged September, but was below economists’ expectations for a 310,000 rise. “If there’s one thing I would focus on, it is the fact you’re really not seeing the wage inflation,” said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc. “The wage numbers are becoming increasing more important than the monthly payrolls number itself.” Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target and could raise concerns about consumer spending. At 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 29.06 points, or 0.12 percent, at 23,545.32, the S&P 500 was up 5.01 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,584.86.

"2017-10-26",-3,"The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows illegal immigrants known as “Dreamers” to obtain work permits. Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress. “Roughly 800,000 Dreamers who are working, going to school, and serving in our nation’s military will lose their ability to work and study legally, will be forced from their jobs, and will be subject to immediate deportation from the country they grew up in,” the coalition said in an ad on Politico on Thursday. The coalition is pushing for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year. A number of its members employ Dreamers. "
"2017-06-15",-4,"The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.4 percent while The S&P 500 information technology index was down 1.7 percent. Google’s parent Alphabet fell 2.7 percent, making it the second-biggest percentage loser in the S&P technology sector after Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to “hold,” from “buy.” The top percentage losers in the technology index were Advanced Micro Devices, down 4.6 percent, and Lam Research, down 2.97 percent. The downgrade triggered a broader tech selloff, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Also, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which ”could mean a bumpy ride lower“ if the prospects for a mega sales cycle diminish for its next smartphone. Apple shares fell 1.9 percent after the report. “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,” said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “I don’t think this is going to be sustained, simply because if you look at the aggregate valuations … tech is not really any more expensive than the market as a whole. Arguably, you are getting a lot more growth at a pretty reasonable price. And that is what has driven the performance so far, but the reality is that is still the case.” The selloff came a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, as expected, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could start selling bonds on its balance sheet “very soon”. While the tech sector has fallen more than 4 percent since last Thursday, it is still up around 17 percent year-to-date, double the roughly 8-percent rise for the S&P 500. That makes technology vulnerable to a pullback, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, who saw no fundamental reason for the move. “Any type of concern in the market, any reason to raise cash levels, very likely these are the first stocks to go to because of the valuation ... because they’ve become so dominant in portfolios,” said Ghriskey who said the selloff is a short-term blip.

Apple fell 0.65 percent on a report that the new iPhone had faced production glitches that could result in supply shortfalls. Comcast’s 7 percent fall weighed the most on the S&P and the Nasdaq, after the company said it expected to lose 100,000 to 150,000 video subscribers in the quarter due to competition. The Dow was pulled lower by a 3.36 percent fall in Walt Disney shares, after its chief executive warned earnings per share growth for this year would roughly be in line with what it reported last year. Disney’s fall weighed on other media stocks, with CBS down 3 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox off 3.9 percent.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 6.66 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,386.66. Investors also kept a watch on Hurricane Irma as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century took aim at Florida. Irma comes close on the heels of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana more than a week ago, claiming 60 lives and causing property damage estimated as high as $180 billion. “As the hurricane moves, investors are looking for a better grip on the damage. There are far-reaching implications now that we have back-to-back ones,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Worries about the impact of hurricanes and weak U.S. jobless claims data sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since Nov. 10.

Energy stocks .SPNY, the worst performing sector year-to-date, were among the ones trying to stop the bleeding on the S&P 500. Despite the flailing leadership in tech stocks, Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said he is not too worried about it becoming a broader market selloff. “We’re not even in correction territory for the Nasdaq or large tech shares. If economic data was worse than what it is, then I’d be worried,” he said. “The risk of recession is still pretty low, so I think this (tech) selloff is not a harbinger.” Jacobsen said he would not yet buy into the market’s dip ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday, as the Fed is “the biggest risk to the market” in the near-term. “If the Fed dismisses the recent bout of soft data and continues hiking (rates) for the sake of hiking, then we could see a correction” in the stock market, he said. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Under Armour (UAA.N), which rose 5.8 percent, while the largest decliner was Netflix (NFLX.O), down 4.2 percent.

Shares of the world’s biggest company by market capitalization were headed for their worst day in more than two months as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investor minds. A bunch of weak corporate earnings also added to the weak sentiment. “Apple has its impact across the board,” said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “The marketing plan here was not a lot to be desired, considering you have two phones and the next one is just two weeks away from release. If it’s going to be a significant upgrade, it did not make any sense to me.” There is also profit-taking in the tech sector, Blancato said.

While a broadly weaker yen pushed Tokyo higher, MSCI’s main indicator of Asian shares outside Japan fell back from a 10-year peak and Europe’s main markets were flat. Apple suppliers including AMS and Dialog fell by 1-3 percent in morning trade in Europe, with traders citing the later than expected Nov. 3 shipping date for the new iPhone. British semi-conductor firm IQE Plc sank more than 6 percent. Apple shares, which finished with a small loss on Tuesday, fell another 0.4 percent in pre-market trade. Wall Street overall was seen opening slightly lower. “It would appear that a running start to the week and fresh record highs in the S&P 500 has proven a little much for some traders, with profit taking seen ahead of Wednesday’s open,” said Craig Erlam, an analyst with online broker Oanda. The pan-European STOXX 600 dipped 0.1 percent as weakness in chipmakers was compounded by a drop in miners . Chipmakers have been the best-performing among Europe’s tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector’s outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. “The economics of the Apple announcement are interesting because it will really test this theory that inflation is going to be weak,” said Mike Bell, global markets strategist with JP Morgan Asset Management in London. “With the iPhone coming in around $1,000 it will be interesting to see how healthy demand is. If it’s relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and consumers have confidence.” In currency markets the dominant trend this week has been a recovery for the dollar and sterling. The dollar hit a 12-day high above 110 yen in Asian time before easing back as traders awaited U.S. inflation numbers on Thursday. Britain’s pound hit a one-year high above $1.33 and a six-week high on a trade-weighted basis before falling back after weak wage data that may undermine any threat the Bank of England might make about raising interest rates. “Now it’s ‘Wait and see’ for U.S. dollar investors,” said Esther Reichelt, a strategist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “Everyone’s waiting for the inflation data tomorrow and the Fed next week.” After a soft start, oil prices were around half a percent higher after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the global oil surplus was starting to shrink due to robust global demand and an output drop from OPEC and other producers.

Shares of Facebook and Apple both hit record highs on Tuesday, up 0.53 percent and 0.75 percent respectively. Surges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year.  And planned measures by President Donald Trump for steep corporate tax cuts and the easing of tax restrictions on profits made abroad would help Apple and other technology companies return more cash to shareholders.   The largest five Silicon Valley companies for years have been increasing their share of revenue and profits generated in the technology sector at the expense of smaller competitors.  Those five players boosted their share of revenue among technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to 46 percent in 2016, from 38 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data. Their share of net income increased to 46 percent from 42 percent during the same time.  Facebook and Google, which is owned by Alphabet, received 77 percent of gross spending on digital advertising in 2016, compared to 72 percent the year before, according to industry data analyzed by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.  Technology company earnings are expected to have grown 17.7 percent in the latest three months, the strongest quarterly expansion since 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple is expected by analysts to have boosted its revenue by 4.8 percent when it reports on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to post a 45.6-percent leap in revenue and a similar increase in earnings per share, according to analysts’ estimates. "

The Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say.  “The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,” said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. “There’s so much investment into the space – it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” For years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators. But the Chromebook’s low price--it starts at $149-- and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States.  To capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a “test mode,” which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google. The preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Sheth said.   While Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee. Microsoft’s hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook.  The company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game. For Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Fisher said. “The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,” he said. “With Microsoft, there’s a lot of moving parts.”  Microsoft declined to comment. Apple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management. “It’s about trying to reach every teacher and every student,” said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple. Despite Google’s U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting.

Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers.  The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week. "

"2017-08-02",-5,"* Apple shares hit all-time top after stellar results * Asian tech index highest since 2000, broader market steady * Wall Street’s Dow Jones index looking to break 22,000 * Dollar losing ground to euro, which makes 18-mth peak on yen * Oil retreats as supply concerns return, again By Marc Jones LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Asian technology stocks hit 17-year peaks and Wall Street’s Dow index looked set to break 22,000 points later on Wednesday, as blockbuster earnings from Apple rippled out to component makers globally. Shares in the world’s most valuable company surged 6 percent after-hours to a record of more than $159 each, taking its market capitalisation above $830 billion. That should help carry the Dow through the 22,000 mark when trading resumes in New York. E-Mini futures for the Dow were up 0.2 percent despite a lower Europe as disappointing results from Societe Generale and Commerzbank weighed on the bank stocks. Apple reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, revenue and earnings per share and signalled its upcoming 10th-anniversary phone is on schedule. It helped dispel one of the few nagging doubts of the corporate earnings season so far -- that Amazon’s lacklustre results last week might have revealed some tiredness among the giant U.S. tech and internet stocks that have been driving the stock market rally all year. “It is all about Apple,” said Naeem Aslam chief market analyst at Think Markets. “The firm comfortably topped its forecast and produced stellar numbers for its revenue and profit.” Among Asia’s Apple suppliers, LG Innnotek jumped 10 percent and SK Hynix, the world’s second-biggest memory chip maker, rose 3.8 percent. Murata Manufacturing firmed 4.9 percent and Taiyo Yuden 4.4 percent, helping Tokyo’s Nikkei up 0.47 percent. The MSCI tech index for Asia also climbed 0.9 percent to ground not trod since early 2000, bringing its gains for the year to a heady 40 percent. Those gains balanced losses in basic materials and energy to leave MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan steady near its highest since late 2007. There was a note of caution over reports that U.S. President Donald Trump was close to a decision on how to respond to what he considers China’s unfair trade practices. Tepid U.S. inflation along with political turmoil in Washington has lessened the possibility of another Federal Reserve rate hike this year, lowering bond yields across the globe. Improving data in other major economies has also served to push the greenback down nearly 11 percent from January peaks, benefiting commodities and emerging markets. A swathe of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) out on Tuesday had underlined how the improvement in activity had broadened out from the United States to Asia and Europe. “That will do nothing to hurt ebullient global risk appetite,” said Ruskin. “This phase of the risk rally is based on growth data, but even more on subdued inflation measures.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was just below an all-time peak. On Wall Street later electric car maker Tesla, gadget firm Fitbit and insurance provider AIG will report results. In currency markets, the dollar index was stuck at just under 93, after touching 92.777, the lowest since early May 2016. It was aided by gains on a softer yen which saw it creep to 110.80. Yet the euro also benefited from buying against the yen , reaching its highest since February last year. It nudged up against the dollar and Swiss Franc too, briefly striking new 2-1/2-year highs against both at $1.1846 and 1.1468 francs per euro respectively. Euro zone June producer price inflation data helped it on its way as it topped analysts’ forecasts. There was a slowdown in the pace overall, but it bolstered bets that the European Central Bank could soon start winding down its more than 2-trillion-euro stimulus programme. “The ECB is going to be the central bank to watch for the rest of the year,” said JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Alex Dryden. “We think they are going to take 9-12 months to get out of the market but that is a big question ... it could even be six months,” he added. Bond markets were largely quiet, with the premiums investors demand to hold South European government debt over the German equivalent close to their lowest levels in weeks and both 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields barely budged. In emerging markets, MSCI’s EM stocks index was near a three-year high. India’s central bank became the first in Asia to cut interest rates this year, while Venezuela’s bonds continued to slid amid rising political tensions there around President Nicolas Maduro. Oil prices were under pressure again too amid rising U.S. fuel inventories and as major world producers kept pumping, causing investors to worry that several weeks of steady gains had pushed the rally too far. Brent crude eased to $51.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 8 cents to $49.07. "

The central bank is on track to gradually raise interest rates as factors depressing inflation are fading and the U.S. economy’s fundamentals are sound, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said. Investors are also awaiting a speech by Fed Chief Janet Yellen later in the week for more guidance on the monetary policy. “Investors would like to get more clarity as far as what the Fed is going to do as they move forward with the unwinding of the balance sheet and how they are going to move forward next year,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. The U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged in its September policy meeting, as expected, but signaled it still expects one more increase by the end of the year, despite a recent bout of low inflation. Apple was down 1.26 percent in premarket trading. The stock clocked its worst weekly loss in over a year as the launch of iPhone 8 kicked off with a lukewarm response globally.

"2017-09-13",1,"* Apple suppliers dent European shares as rally flags * Dollar extends gains, inflation data eyed By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged lower on Wednesday, pulled lower over concerns about the launch of Apple’s new iPhone X, while the dollar rose after a report showed U.S. producer prices rebounded in August, suggesting a strong economy. The yield on European and U.S. government debt rose, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting a 2-1/2 week high. Oil prices rose after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said a global surplus was starting to shrink, even though U.S. data showed another big increase in crude inventories due to the ongoing impact from Hurricane Harvey on the Houston energy hub. European equities pared earlier losses to edge higher thanks to gains in oil and banking stocks, which offset weak chipmakers and a fall in miners. Chipmakers that supply Apple were among the worst performers, with AMS down 3.9 percent and Dialog Semiconductor off 1.6 percent. STMicro ended up 0.1 percent. Chipmakers have been the best performing among Europe’s tech stocks this year, accounting for a large chunk of the sector’s outperformance. AMS shares have gained 165 percent year-to-date. MSCI’s all-country world stock index shed 0.19 percent, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.10 percent and the Euro STOXX 50 rose 0.3 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.01 points, or 0.04 percent, to 22,126.87. The S&P 500 lost 1.17 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,495.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.77 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,447.51. The launch of Apple’s iPhone X will test whether inflation is going to be weak, said Mike Bell, global markets strategist with JP Morgan Asset Management in London. Investors will need to gauge how strong demand will be for the iPhone X, as its price will start at $999, he said. “If it’s relatively healthy I think it shows that there is still quite a lot of pricing power for U.S. companies and consumers have confidence,” Bell said. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.56 percent at 92.396. The index rose after the U.S. Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent in August after slipping 0.1 percent in July. The rebound was driven by a surge in the cost of gasoline. The euro fell 0.59 percent to $1.1894 while the Japanese yen weakened 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 110.61 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.1848 percent. Their German counterpart, 10 year Bunds, fell 7 basis points in price to yield 0.403 percent. Oil prices jumped after the IEA report but then pared gains. U.S. crude rose 1.62 percent to $49.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $54.90, up 1.16 percent on the day. “A sharp rebound in U.S. oil production compared with last week has limited gains in crude prices as concerns grow that oil output is recovering faster than refining capacity coming online,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

Concerns around the severity of Hurricane Irma’s financial impact receded as it weakened to a tropical depression, while investors shrugged off fresh developments related to North Korea. “There’s a relief factor, at least for the moment, that the North Korea situation has gone a little bit quiet, and the fact that the hurricane over the weekend was not as bad as expected,” said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management.

The iPhone maker’s stock was down 1 percent at $153.88 after brokerage Pacific Crest downgraded it to “sector weight” from “overweight”. There is also a possibility that the company may take the unusual step of introducing a new product at the five-day conference, which kicks off on Monday. Investors appeared to have shrugged off weekend attacks in London that came just days before Britain’s general national election on Thursday. Opinion polls in the past week have put Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives ahead, though with a narrowing lead over the Labour opposition. Data on Monday showed services sector activity slowed in May as new orders tumbled, while orders for manufactured goods fell in April for the first time in five months.

Apple rose 1.60 percent to an all-time high and provided the biggest boost to all three major indexes. The Dow is on track to post gains for the 11th straight session, the blue-chip index’s longest streak for consecutive gains since February, driven by a strong quarterly earnings season. Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected with analysts now expecting S&P 500 earnings to have expanded 11.8 percent, compared with 8 percent at the start of July, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve had an exceptional second-quarter earnings season which has given investors confidence,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve. “But with earnings coming to a close, no major economic data and seasonality issues, trading volume is expected to be slightly diminished.” Trading volume is also expected to be relatively tepid with no major legislation expected as the U.S. Congress is on vacation and with the summer months setting in. The S&P hasn’t had a move of more than 0.5 percent since July and has fallen more than 1 percent only twice this year.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 13.91 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,397.68. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 0.40 percent rise leading the advancers. The Labor Department said U.S. job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped to a record high in June and was at the highest level since December 2000. Also on investors’ radar is the rush of retail earnings this week and next amid Amazon.com’s rapid rise. “With retail earnings, it would be interesting to see if expectations have fallen enough for these companies to beat them,” Wiegand said. Macy‘s, Kohl‘s, JC Penney are expected to report results this week, with Wal-Mart, Target due next week.

STMicro posted net revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18.9 percent year-on-year, putting the diversified chipmaker on track to deliver 18 percent growth in 2017, the company said.  If confirmed it would mark the first time that STMicro has recorded solid double-digit growth since 2010.

All major regions grew by double digits both compared to a year ago and between the second and third quarters.  Third-quarter gross margins rose to an average of 39.5 percent, slightly above the 39 percent target that the company set in July. It said it expected fourth-quarter margins of 39.9 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  “We see clear opportunities in front of us to continue to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value and we are determined to capture this additional potential,” Chief Executive and President Carlo Bozotti said in a statement. Replying to an analyst question on whether the group could look at M&A to boost growth now that restructuring is behind it, the Italian boss said that STMicro had the right capital structure to engage in deals, but that this was not its priority for now. “M&A is not on the table, our priority is organic growth,” said Bozzotti.  STMicro has sat on the sideline of sector consolidation, with rivals Texas Instruments (TXN.O), Infineon (IFXGn.DE), Avago and NXP (NXPI.O) snapping up rivals and getting stronger. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) is also in the process of acquiring NXP for $38 billion, a deal that would make it the leader of the fast growing automotive chips market, if it gets approved by EU watchdog.  “European players STMicro and Infineon are being dwarfed”, said an STMicro minority investor, who did not want to be identified. “A tie-up between the two would help them to scale up and nicely complement their products.” Net profit attributable to the parent company more than tripled to $236 million from $71.0 million in the year-ago quarter. That easily topped analysts forecasts which ranged from $210-$220 million, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. "
"2017-11-14",-4,"Congo is by far the world’s biggest producer of cobalt, accounting for more than half of global supplies of the metal, a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries. Amnesty, however, says about a fifth of the country’s cobalt production is mined by hand by informal miners including children, often in dangerous conditions. Cobalt has shot to prominence in recent months and its price skyrocketed due to expected growth in demand for electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries.   “Companies have a responsibility to prove they are not profiting from the misery of miners working in terrible conditions in the DRC,” Amnesty official Seema Joshi said in a statement. The group ranked 29 companies on how well they were tracking their sources of cobalt since Amnesty released a report in January 2016 warning about human rights abuses linked to cobalt mining in Congo. “Apple became the first company to publish the names of its cobalt suppliers ... but other electronics brands have made alarmingly little progress,” the statement said. Most cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper or nickel mining, but artisanal miners in southern Congo exploit deposits near the surface that are rich in cobalt. The biggest buyer of ore from small-scale miners was Congo Dongfang Mining International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese mineral giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd, Amnesty found in its report last year.  Since then, Huayou Cobalt “has taken a number of steps” in line with international standards but “gaps in information remain”, Amnesty said. In March this year, researchers from Amnesty and Congolese group African Resources Watch returned to informal mines and still found adults and children in unsafe conditions, the report said. Huayou, in a letter to Amnesty, said child labor was a difficult issue caused by poverty, adding that it was working on several initiatives including building schools and providing micro-credit to boost small businesses.    “SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS” Microsoft was among 26 companies that had failed to disclose details of their suppliers, Amnesty said. In a letter replying to the Amnesty report, Microsoft said its approach was “holistic” and included work within its supply chain as well as on the ground to address the socioeconomic causes of child labor. “Despite Amnesty International’s assertions, Microsoft has made significant progress on this important issue,” it said. Cobalt prices have spiked 85 percent this year on forecasts that demand will double in the next decade due to surging use of the metal in electric car batteries. Amnesty said among car makers, BMW had made the most improvements, while Renault and Daimler “performed particularly badly”. Renault said it had set up a working group with its suppliers, which had already shared their systems of controls, their supply-chain policies and details of audits. The French company had also joined the Responsible Raw Materials Initiative, which expects its first pilot audits by the end of the year, it added in a letter to Amnesty. Daimler said it was working on identifying the smelters and mines that supplied cobalt to the company. “Daimler is by no means ignoring its responsibility in terms of human rights due diligence, as your current statement seems  to suggest,” it told Amnesty.

"2017-01-05",-7,"* English, Chinese versions pulled on Dec. 23 -NYT * Newspaper’s website blocked since 2012 -NYT * Regulator has called for greater media scrutiny By Cate Cadell and Aishwarya Venugopal BEIJING, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has removed the New York Times Co’s English- and Chinese-language news apps from its iTunes store in China following a request from the local authorities, the companies said separately on Thursday. The apps, which the newspaper said were removed on Dec. 23, are the latest Western services to fall foul of Chinese authorities, whose other scalps include Apple’s own iBooks and iTunes Movies stores which have been blocked since April. Their removal comes just over a month after the Cyberspace Administration of China called for greater media scrutiny, citing fears of social disorder, moral harm and threats to national security. The internet regulator did not respond to a faxed request for comment about the Times’ apps. “The development of the internet in China must respect China’s laws and regulations, in principle,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in response to a question about the apps. New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told Reuters that the newspaper has asked Apple to reconsider. “The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country,” Murphy said. The government has blocked the Times’ websites since 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth of the family of then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the New York Times reported. “We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Apple spokesman Fred Sainz in California told Reuters. An Apple spokeswoman in China declined to comment on specific reasons or which regulatory body made the request. Apple has previously removed news apps from its China app store, but none as high-profile as the New York Times. At least three other apps have been removed from the app store in recent years on the grounds of “illegal content”, according to news reports and the apps’ developers. Apps from other international publications whose websites are blocked, including CNN, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, were still available on Thursday. Chinese mainstream media has not reported the app removal but it was discussed widely on social media. “This must be coming from the request of The Wall right?” said one user on microblogging service Weibo, referring to state-backed internet censorship. “Apple has made enough money in China, it’s OK for it to take the blame this time for the sake of the money.” Other users said they would attempt to change their country of residence within the app store to restore access. While the New York Times’ websites have been blocked, mirroring sites managed by anti-censorship advocates have periodically made their content available.

"2016-12-03",-1,"“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. Some analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. Apple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. In  September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N). Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. An auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

U.S. President Donald Trump opened the door to blacklisting people and entities doing business with North Korea, further tightening the screws on Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “The Fed had investors on edge already. Ratcheting up of North Korea tensions can put investors in a little more of a risk-off mode,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners, in Huntersville, NC. However, with the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX closing at its lowest level in nearly two months at 9.67, Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, said the market is not reflecting risks such as  U.S.-North Korea tensions and high valuations. The market is “very complacent and very comfortable in its own skin right now and not really concerned about risk much at all,” said Cecchini: “I‘m worried about that.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 53.36 points, or 0.24 percent, to 22,359.23, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.64 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,500.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 33.35 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,422.69.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress. “Roughly 800,000 Dreamers who are working, going to school, and serving in our nation’s military will lose their ability to work and study legally, will be forced from their jobs, and will be subject to immediate deportation from the country they grew up in,” the coalition said in an ad on Politico on Thursday.

Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News.  Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users. For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers.

Shares of Apple fell 1.3 percent and was on track to post its biggest two-day decline since June. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major indexes. Investors were also assessing the likely impact of the Fed’s decision to start ending monetary stimulus by reducing its approximately $4.2 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities from October. While the central bank left rates unchanged, it cited low unemployment, growth in business investment and an economic expansion that has been moderate but durable this year to build its case for another rate hike in 2017. Interest rate futures are now pricing in about a 70 percent chance of a December hike, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, up from above 50 percent prior to the Fed meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the fall in inflation this year remained a mystery, adding that the central bank was ready to change the interest rate outlook if needed. “Today’s movement is most likely a give back as people digest the Fed statement and press conference,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “Clearly the Fed doesn’t have answers on the 2017 low inflation weakness but they’re still very sensitive to falling behind the curve so they want to stay in front of the inflation curve.” At 12:33 p.m. ET (1633 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.2 points, or 0.13 percent, at 22,383.39, the S&P was down 3.41 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,504.83.

Advanced Micro reversed course to trade down 2.9 percent and Tesla was off 1.6 percent. U.S. stocks have continued to climb this year, with the S&P up about 12 percent so far, helped by strong corporate profits and optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut taxes for businesses.

"2017-10-24",1,"Earnings aside, trading remained timid as investors awaited the next market catalyst: the ECB meeting on Thursday. “The market is anticipating that the ECB highlights some kind of inclination towards lower for longer, and that’s supportive for equities,” said Credit Suisse’s Bose. “If they were a bit more hawkish that could take a bit of the steam out of the rally we’ve seen.” AMS (AMS.S) jumped 22 percent after reporting third-quarter sales just under expectations. Analysts said strong fourth-quarter guidance from the iPhone supplier offset the miss. “With AMS shares down 15 percent in the last month given concerns around the impact from iPhone X delays/constraints, we see solid Q4 guidance as a relief till we get more clarity on iPhone sell-in trends when Apple reports on Nov. 2,” Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Other companies exposed to the iPhone X introduction also gained, with Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) up 2.8 percent and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) up 1.3 percent.   Analysts said overall European company earnings could outperform against forecasts which were revised down ahead of the third-quarter results season.  “Expectations are lower and it will potentially be easier for there to be surprises,” said Pierre Bose, head of European equity strategy at Credit Suisse.  Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Santander (SAN.MC) led Spain’s IBEX higher after Caixa reported the flow of deposits out of the bank had slowed since it moved its headquarters out of Catalonia. Euro zone banks .SX7E rose 1.3 percent, their strongest daily gain in more than a fortnight as Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) also made strong gains. The German lender’s shares jumped 6 percent after sources said it hired Goldman Sachs and Rothschild to help defend against potential takeover bids. Analysts at KBW were skeptical, however. “We continue not to assume any M&A premium for CBK due to regulatory uncertainty and the unattractiveness of the German banking market,” they said in a note, pointing to low return on total equity among German banks. “We doubt that Commerzbank can receive a bid in the next 12-18 months,” they added.

German plastics maker Covestro (1COV.DE) jumped 8.6 percent to a record high after reporting a 50 percent increase in third-quarter earnings and a share buyback of up to 1.5 billion euros.

"2017-07-11",-1,"* Consumer staples, real estate outweigh cyclical strength * Apple suppliers rise as JPM upgrades STMicro * Split among UK retailers after M&S results * Staffing companies hit by Deutsche Bank downgrades (ADVISORY- Follow European and UK stock markets in real time on the Reuters Live Markets blog on Eikon - see cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets) By Helen Reid LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - European shares reversed early gains to turn lower on Tuesday as heavy losses among defensive consumer staples and real estate stocks outweighed strength in autos, miners and banks. The pan-European STOXX 600 edged down 0.3 percent, while euro zone stocks and blue-chips dipped 0.1 percent, in muted trading punctuated by early earnings updates and more corporate deal-making. Consumer staples including food and drink companies and household goods were the biggest drags, with real estate stocks also falling 0.9 percent. Autos stocks were a bright spot, up 0.8 percent, after data showed Chinese passenger car sales rose. “We note that defensive equity sectors earnings have generally weakened while cyclical sectors keep their positive momentum,” said Valentin Bissat, equity analyst at Mirabaud Asset Management. “Overall for the region, the equity risk premium has decreased, which in turn increases companies’ buybacks, a trend which is likely to continue in the short term as reduced uncertainties and a cyclical recovery decrease the necessity to hold liquidity in cash,” Bissat added. Pearson wiped out early gains to fall to the bottom of the STOXX, down 3.5 percent after selling a 22 percent stake in publisher Penguin Random House. Analysts at Liberum, which has a ‘sell’ rating on the restructuring education publisher, were sceptical over the details of the deal. Marks & Spencer reported a rise in full-price sales, but its shares fell 1.9 percent, partly on the back of underwhelming food sales, while rivals Tesco and Morrisons rose. Broker notes spurred some of the biggest individual moves, with semiconductor makers STMicro and AMS top gainers after JP Morgan raised STMicro - a supplier to tech giant Apple - to ‘overweight’. “We believe that the market is too cautious on STMicro,” wrote European tech analyst Sandeep Deshpande. Deshpande also said Apple suppliers would have a strong second half, calling the market too sceptical and predicting the semiconductor stocks would meet or beat expectations. Among the top individual drags on the STOXX 600 were Randstad and Adecco, targeted by Deutsche Bank in a note on staffing firms. Analysts at Deutsche cut ratings for the world’s two largest staffing companies, saying current employment levels in the United States and Europe were associated with peaking 12-month investor returns. British recruitment firm Hays followed its European peers down 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, in the incipient European earnings season, a strong update from Danish insurer Tryg pushed it up 3.5 percent to a two-year high. Berenberg analyst Iain Pearce said a special dividend could be expected at year-end. Steel industrials firm Thyssenkrupp rose 2.3 percent after saying it would cut 2,000 to 2,500 jobs by the end of the 2019/2020 fiscal year. "

Apple jumped 6.53 percent in premarket trading, a day after the world’s largest publicly listed company reported strong results and iPhone sales, and signaled its upcoming 10th-anniversary phone is on schedule. The stock is up about 30 percent this year. The S&P 500 information technology index is up 22 percent year to date, leading other sectors, as investors look for growth in an otherwise low-growth environment. The Dow has risen 11 percent in 2017, even as Wall Street is losing confidence that President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would be able to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending this year. The Dow hit the 20,000 mark in late January and crossed the 21,000 mark in just over a month on March 1, helped by a rise in banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. “Investors are completely immune to all the drama which is taking place in Washington because if you look at the performance of the Dow, it appears everything is hunky-dory,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. “In earnings, it is all about Apple. The big news was about the production of iPhone 8, the flagship product for the firm will hit the market on time with no issues around production.” Two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have reported their second-quarter earnings so far and 72 percent of them have beaten Wall Street’s expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In a typical quarter, 64 percent of the companies beat expectations. The results may reassure investors worried about high valuations. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its 10-year average of 14 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Dow e-minis were up 46 points, or 0.21 percent, with 15,786 contracts changing hands at 8:17 a.m. ET (1217 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 112,883 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 44 points, or 0.75 percent, on volume of 34,467 contracts. Data showed U.S. private employers added 178,000 jobs in July, after adding 191,000 jobs in June. Economists polled by Reuters expected an addition of 185,000 jobs. The data comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday.

"2017-09-21",-6,"* Bets for a U.S. Dec rate hike surge * Indexes down: Dow 0.16 pct, S&P 0.19 pct, Nasdaq 0.33 pct (Updates to late afternoon, adds commentary, changes byline) By Sinead Carew Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were trading lower on Thursday, weighed down by Apple and rising expectations for a third interest rate hike this year. The S&P and the Dow were on track to snap a string of record sessions and Apple was the biggest drag on the three major indexes with a 1.3-percent drop on concerns about demand for its latest smartphone. Investors increased bets the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise rates again this year and were also assessing the impact of the central bank’s decision to start reducing its roughly $4.2 trillion U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. With investors reacting to the signal for another rate hike and the start of the Fed’s balance sheet normalization, the market does not appear to reflect the risks associated with U.S.-North Korea tensions and high valuations, said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “The market is down 10 basis points but it is very complacent and very comfortable in its own skin right now and not really concerned about risk,” said Cecchini, citing low market volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index was slightly higher on Thursday at 9.79, but had hit its lowest level since August 8 earlier in the day. Investors are now pricing in about a 70-percent chance of a December hike, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, up from about 51 percent just prior to the Fed meeting. At 2:58 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.4 points, or 0.16 percent, to 22,376.19, the S&P 500 lost 4.73 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,503.51 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 6,434.71. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the fall in inflation this year remained a mystery, adding that the central bank was ready to change the interest rate outlook if needed. “Today’s movement is most likely a give-back as people digest the Fed statement and press conference,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “Clearly, the Fed doesn’t have answers on the 2017 low inflation weakness, but they’re still very sensitive to falling behind the curve so they want to stay in front of the inflation curve.” Only two of the 11 major S&P sectors, financials and industrials, were higher, with gains around 0.4 percent. The consumer staples index was the biggest decliner with a 0.95 percent drop. Financial stocks have been on a tear in recent days as investors anticipated Fed commentary on rate hikes, which tend to help bank profits. The S&P has risen about 11.8 percent so far this year, helped by strong corporate profits and lingering optimism among some investors that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut taxes for businesses. This has boosted valuations. The S&P is trading near 17.6 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14.3, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “It’s very hard for me to see a tremendous catalyst for the upside although I also don’t see that massive catalyst to create a crack to the downside,” said Cantor’s Cecchini. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Wall Street was little changed, as an unimpressive payrolls report was offset by a 2.58 percent gain in Apple a day after the iPhone maker posted quarterly results. U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but a sharp retreat in annual wage gains and surge in the number of people dropping out of the work force cast a cloud over the labor market. “Wages were flat, last month we saw a little bit of a surprise bump upward in that so we were expecting a more moderate number there,” said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska. “We do think wage pressure could start to weigh on the markets next year in a tight labor market.” Apple gave the biggest boost to each of the major Wall Street indexes after the stronger-than-expected results it reported on Thursday offered a rosy forecast for the holiday shopping season. Long, snaking lines formed outside the company’s stores in Asia and Europe on Friday as fans flocked to buy the new iPhone X and the U.S. company, the largest by market capitalization, moved closer to a $1 trillion valuation. With 406 of S&P 500 having reported earnings, 72.4 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, in line with the 72 percent average over the past four quarters. The current growth estimate for the quarter stands at 8 percent.

European shares crept higher on firmer tech stocks and carmakers, though gains were limited as earnings weighed on shares of French bank Societe Generale and Dutch telecoms company Altice. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.09 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.14 percent. The dollar was track for a third straight week of gains after data on U.S. manufacturing and services reversed a drop following the payrolls report.

Amazon jumped as much 12.8 percent after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Google-parent Alphabet gained 6.4 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft advanced 7.3 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services. Apple rose 3.4 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. The gains drove the S&P technology index up about 3 percent. The sector has gained about 35 percent this year, double the gains in the broader S&P index. “In many ways, we’re seeing the strong getting stronger,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “While valuations are full, it certainly becomes imperative on them to deliver solid operating results and that’s something that we did see.” Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities. A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank also supported the stocks. In Powell’s appointment, investors see a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy.

The three indexes were on track to post weekly gains and the Nasdaq was poised to record its best intraday percentage gain in nearly a year. Chevron’s 3.8 percent dip weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil giant’s profit missed estimates. Merck slipped about 5 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs. Mattel plunged 14 percent after the toymaker said it would miss its full-year revenue forecast and stop dividend from the fourth quarter. Expedia was slumped 18.4 percent after the online travel services company’s profit missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast.

"2017-05-03",7,"By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO, May 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company’s determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google’s Chromebook is now the computer of choice. The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users. In 2016, mobile devices running Alphabet Inc’s Google’s Chrome operating system accounted for 58 percent of the U.S. market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting. The Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say. “The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,” said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. “There’s so much investment into the space – it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” For years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators. But the Chromebook’s low price--it starts at $149-- and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States. To capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a “test mode,” which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google. The preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Sheth said. While Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee. For Microsoft, Tuesday’s event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director for the education division at Futuresource Consulting. Microsoft’s hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook. The company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game. For Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Fisher said. “The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,” he said. “With Microsoft, there’s a lot of moving parts.” Microsoft declined to comment. Apple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management. “It’s about trying to reach every teacher and every student,” said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple. Despite Google’s U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. In 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23 percent of the mobile market outside the United States, compared with 65 percent for Microsoft’s Windows, according to Futuresource. "

"2017-09-12",-5,"After the closing bell, Nordstrom shares (JWN.N) jumped 8.8 percent after reports that the high-end retailer chose private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners to help take the company private. The financial sector .SPSY was the S&P 500’s biggest driver during the regular session as bank stocks were helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields, while the utilities and real estate sectors lost ground.  “It’s a better environment for risk assets. As long as these two issues - North Korea and the hurricane - have receded as concerns, it gives investors a green light to focus on stronger fundamentals,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 61.49 points, or 0.28 percent, to 22,118.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.37 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,496.48 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 22.018 points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,454.28. Concerns about Hurricane Irma’s impact receded as it weakened to a tropical depression, while investors shrugged off U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments that the latest U.N. sanctions on North Korea were only a very small step and nothing compared with what would have to happen to deal with the country’s nuclear program. “A lot of it is the realization that the latest hurricane wasn’t as devastating in the U.S. as people feared,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. While some investors cited worries about whether Apple would face supply shortages, others said traders were just taking profits. “There were no blockbuster surprises although what they’re doing with the products is all pretty good,” said Ghriskey. The iPhone maker was the second-biggest drag on the S&P behind McDonald’s (MCD.N), which fell 3.2 percent to a more than one-month low on concerns about its third-quarter results. Financials .SPSY, the biggest upward driver on the S&P, rose 1.2 percent, helped by a 1.8 percent jump in the bank subsector .SPXBK. Investors in banks, whose profits are boosted in part by higher rates, were reacting to a jump in U.S. Treasury 10-year yields US10YT=RR to a three-week high after a 10-year note auction. Also, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 2.2 percent to $225.95 after it unveiled a growth plan that could add as much as $5 billion in revenue annually. The S&P Utilities .SPLRCU and Real Estate .SPLRCREC sectors were the laggards of the day, with 1.75 percent and 1.2 percent declines respectively, as investors shied away from interest rate-sensitive stocks.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The Dow pierced through the historic 20,000 milestone in January and the 21,000 mark barely one and a half months later. All eyes will now be on the quarterly performance of Dow-component Apple, which reports after the closing bell. The iPhone maker’s shares were up 0.25 percent. Tech has been the best performing sector this year, despite recent bouts of volatility on rising valuation concerns. The tech index’s 0.49 percent rise on Tuesday led the major S&P sectors. Amazon provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq with its 1.5 percent rise. “While valuations overall and for the tech sector isn’t cheap, some of the most powerful earnings growth has come from large-cap technology names,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Investors have been counting on earnings to support high valuations for equities. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its long-term average of 15 times. S&P 500 earnings are expected on average to have grown 10.8 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We are two-thirds through the earnings season and estimates are going only higher, including for the full year, which is helping support the fundamentals-driven market.” said Northey. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1458 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 89.92 points, or 0.41 percent, at 21,981.04 and the S&P 500 was up 5.6 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,475.90. The Nasdaq Composite was up 16.49 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,364.61. A 0.22 percent fall in healthcare led the laggards. Pfizer was down 1.10 percent after the drugmaker’s quarterly revenue missed expectations. Regeneron fell 3.58 percent following a rating downgrade by a brokerage. The stock was the top drag on the Nasdaq. Economic data showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in June as income failed to increase for the first time in seven months. The core PCE numbers - the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric to gauge inflation - for June edged up 0.1 percent following a similar increase in May. In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent after advancing by the same margin in May, remaining below the Fed’s 2 percent target rate. Under Armour fell 6.41 percent after the sportswear maker cut its full-year sales forecast. Sprint jumped 9.78 percent after swinging to a quarterly profit for the first time in three years.

"2017-08-09",-8,"Japanese electronics makers have struggled to compete against their Asian rivals, ceding market share to cut-price Chinese competitors at the low end of the market but also failing to innovate enough to stay ahead in high-end products. Japan Display has been caught out by a swift change in consumption trends, with handset makers shifting to the thinner and flexible OLED displays from LCDs for high-end models. It plans to start mass-producing OLED panels for smartphones only in 2019, while Apple, whose orders account for more than half of the firm’s current sales, is widely expected to begin adopting OLED for its iPhones later this year. “We now see no future for the smartphone panel business without OLED,” CEO Nobuhiro Higashiiriki said at a quarterly results briefing. “We have strategically changed our direction.” In the red over the past three years, Japan Display posted a net loss of 31.46 billion yen ($286.13 million) in the quarter ended June, versus a 11.8 billion yen loss a year ago. Higashiiriki said the firm will seek partnership with global companies, potentially Chinese panel makers. “Partnership could take various forms,” with a capital injection among options, he said. While Chinese display makers are seen by analysts as the most likely candidates for investing in Japan Display as they rapidly expand their presence in the display market with state support, there could be protectionist concerns. There are doubts if Japan Display’s main investor - the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) - would allow Chinese players to take a stake in the firm, said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan. INCJ helped form Japan Display five years ago by combining the ailing display units of Sony Corp (6758.T), Hitachi (6501.T) and Toshiba Corp (6502.T). But the firm’s continuing struggle questions the validity of government interventions in business.  Quick and bold investment decisions that are crucial in the competitive tech industry are often hard to make for funds with taxpayers’ money, analysts said. As of now, INCJ is expected to play a major role in groups that are the front-runners for Toshiba’s planned sale of its $18 billion chip business. Japan Display said it had received a new line of credit worth 107 billion yen from its main lenders to finance the operational overhaul. That is on top of 75 billion yen in aid last year from INCJ. The company said 3,500 of the 3,700 job cuts will come from overseas, but declined to specify locations. It has a total of five plants abroad - in China, the Philippines and Taiwan. "

The iPhone maker’s stock was down 0.80 percent at $154.28 after brokerage Pacific Crest downgraded it to “sector weight” from “overweight”. There is also a possibility that the company may take the unusual step of introducing a new product at the five-day conference, which begins later in the day. Investors appeared to have shrugged off weekend attacks in London that came just days before Britain’s general national election on Thursday. Opinion polls in the past week have put Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives ahead, though with a narrowing lead over the Labour opposition. U.S. stocks continue to hover at record levels, helped by a strong first-quarter corporate earnings season, with Wall Street closing at record levels for the second straight session on Friday despite a lukewarm jobs report. The employment report, however, could raise concerns about the economy’s health after gross domestic product growth slowed in the first quarter. Data on Monday showed services sector activity slowed in May as new orders tumbled, while orders for manufactured goods fell in April for the first time in five months. Despite the disappointing data, market participants still expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its June 13-14 meeting, with traders expecting a 95.6-percent chance of a quarter-point hike, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. “We’re coming off a pretty strong rally and, in the absence of news to change that direction, we would anticipate that it would continue in that fashion,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. “Plus anytime you have an attack, such as the one in the UK, it causes some market disruption. This has been a resilient equity market and as we go through the course of this week, economic data and the Fed will drive the market.” At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.33 points, or 0.01 percent, at 21,204.96 and the S&P 500 was down 1.41 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,437.66.

Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the health index’s 0.42 percent fall leading the decliners. The financial sector’s 0.62 percent rise led the gainers, with Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 percent rise boosting the Dow. Alphabet hit the $1,000 mark and provided the second biggest boost to the S&P and Nasdaq. Herbalife was down 6.2 percent at $69.32 after the nutritional supplement maker lowered its sales outlook for the current quarter. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on concerns that the cutting of ties with Qatar by top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and other Arab states could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,706 to 1,063. On the Nasdaq, 1,605 issues fell and 1,087 advanced.

"2017-10-26",2,"STMicro’s imaging business provided the stand out performance, sales more than doubling in the last three months to $158 million. Demand has been ramping up for the company’s new Time of Flight sensors, which analysts widely believe Apple is buying as a proximity or motion detector to use in its latest iPhones.  STMicro posted net revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18.9 percent year-on-year, putting the diversified chipmaker on track to deliver 18 percent growth in 2017, the company said.  If confirmed it would mark the first time that STMicro has recorded solid double-digit growth since 2010. The company generated double-digit sales growth across all four of its business lines compared to the year-ago quarter. All major regions grew by double digits both compared to a year ago and between the second and third quarters.  Third-quarter gross margins rose to an average of 39.5 percent, slightly above the 39 percent target that the company set in July. It said it expected fourth-quarter margins of 39.9 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  “We see clear opportunities in front of us to continue to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value and we are determined to capture this additional potential,” Chief Executive and President Carlo Bozotti said in a statement. Replying to an analyst question on whether the group could look at M&A to boost growth now that restructuring is behind it, the Italian boss said that STMicro had the right capital structure to engage in deals, but that this was not its priority for now. “M&A is not on the table, our priority is organic growth,” said Bozzotti.  STMicro has sat on the sideline of sector consolidation, with rivals Texas Instruments (TXN.O), Infineon (IFXGn.DE), Avago and NXP (NXPI.O) snapping up rivals and getting stronger. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) is also in the process of acquiring NXP for $38 billion, a deal that would make it the leader of the fast growing automotive chips market, if it gets approved by EU watchdog.  “European players STMicro and Infineon are being dwarfed”, said an STMicro minority investor, who did not want to be identified. “A tie-up between the two would help them to scale up and nicely complement their products.” Net profit attributable to the parent company more than tripled to $236 million from $71.0 million in the year-ago quarter. That easily topped analysts forecasts which ranged from $210-$220 million, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. "

"2017-11-14",-4,"Congo is by far the world’s biggest producer of cobalt, accounting for more than half of global supplies of the metal, a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries. Amnesty, however, says about a fifth of the country’s cobalt production is mined by hand by informal miners including children, often in dangerous conditions. Cobalt has shot to prominence in recent months and its price skyrocketed due to expected growth in demand for electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries.   “Companies have a responsibility to prove they are not profiting from the misery of miners working in terrible conditions in the DRC,” Amnesty official Seema Joshi said in a statement. The group ranked 29 companies on how well they were tracking their sources of cobalt since Amnesty released a report in January 2016 warning about human rights abuses linked to cobalt mining in Congo. “Apple became the first company to publish the names of its cobalt suppliers ... but other electronics brands have made alarmingly little progress,” the statement said. Most cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper or nickel mining, but artisanal miners in southern Congo exploit deposits near the surface that are rich in cobalt. The biggest buyer of ore from small-scale miners was Congo Dongfang Mining International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese mineral giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd, Amnesty found in its report last year.  Since then, Huayou Cobalt “has taken a number of steps” in line with international standards but “gaps in information remain”, Amnesty said. In March this year, researchers from Amnesty and Congolese group African Resources Watch returned to informal mines and still found adults and children in unsafe conditions, the report said. Huayou, in a letter to Amnesty, said child labor was a difficult issue caused by poverty, adding that it was working on several initiatives including building schools and providing micro-credit to boost small businesses.    “SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS” Microsoft was among 26 companies that had failed to disclose details of their suppliers, Amnesty said. In a letter replying to the Amnesty report, Microsoft said its approach was “holistic” and included work within its supply chain as well as on the ground to address the socioeconomic causes of child labor. “Despite Amnesty International’s assertions, Microsoft has made significant progress on this important issue,” it said. Cobalt prices have spiked 85 percent this year on forecasts that demand will double in the next decade due to surging use of the metal in electric car batteries. Amnesty said among car makers, BMW had made the most improvements, while Renault and Daimler “performed particularly badly”. Renault said it had set up a working group with its suppliers, which had already shared their systems of controls, their supply-chain policies and details of audits. The French company had also joined the Responsible Raw Materials Initiative, which expects its first pilot audits by the end of the year, it added in a letter to Amnesty. Daimler said it was working on identifying the smelters and mines that supplied cobalt to the company. “Daimler is by no means ignoring its responsibility in terms of human rights due diligence, as your current statement seems  to suggest,” it told Amnesty.

Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News.  Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users. For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers. For example, NBCUniversal and Vox partnered on an ad product, Concert, that packages inventory from NBCUniversal and Vox’s digital properties and offers it to advertisers. NBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers’ content; in the past, publishers would get 70 percent of the revenue with the other 30 percent going to Apple.

"2017-07-27",-6,"“We are actually taking some share in the market ... early signs look quite promising in terms of market share development,” Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a conference call. Telecom equipment suppliers have struggled in recent years amid weak demand from telecom companies, but Nokia said it had won markets thanks to its broader product portfolio following its 2016 acquisition of rival Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia’s profit growth is in stark contrast to loss-making Swedish rival Ericsson, which stunned investors this year by announcing $1.7 billion in provisions, writedowns and restructuring costs. Demand for the current generation of faster 4G mobile broadband equipment has peaked, so equipment vendors are now waiting for telecoms firms to upgrade to next-generation 5G equipment, which Suri said would become “meaningful” in 2019. Nokia bought Alcatel-Lucent in a $15.6 billion deal which gave it a larger fixed-line network business and made it less dependent on mobile broadband. The deal also helped it launch new router products aimed at internet giants. Another major rival, China’s Huawei, which is also a major phone manufacturer, reported a 15 percent rise in its half-year sales on Thursday, but it did not break down profits for its networks business. Huawei has previously signaled it would scale back its aggressive price competition to strengthen overall profits. “We now expect a decline in the market in the range of 3-5 percent, versus our earlier view of a low-single digit decline,” Suri said. Nokia’s network business, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of its sales, is set to decline in 2017 in line with the market trend. However, Nokia reiterated its full-year operating margin forecast of 8 percent to 10 percent for the business. “Weakening of the general market outlook is a clear minus. But Nokia’s profitability shows they are able to deliver good results in weak markets,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on the stock. Nokia’s second-quarter network sales fell 5 percent from a year earlier but total sales only decreased 1 percent to 5.63 billion euros, helped by a boost in licensing royalties thanks to a deal with Apple to settling a patent dispute. Suri said Nokia was stepping up spending on research and development, saying he saw a bigger 5G market taking shape than the company had envisioned as recently as last year. “We think that 5G will likely last longer and be deeper than first thought,” Suri said. “5G trials will accelerate in 2018 and, in 2019, we can expect to see meaningful deployment in the U.S., China and potentially other markets like Japan.” Once the world’s biggest mobile phone maker, Nokia was caught out by the rise of smartphones and ended up selling the handset business to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it with the networks business and a portfolio of technology patents.

"2017-05-03",-10,"* Apple drags Wall St lower after iPhone sales dip * Fed statement eyed for signal of June rate hike (Updates with U.S. market open, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - World stock markets fell on Wednesday as declines in iPhone  sales brought about some concern about consumer strength, while the dollar edged higher before a U.S. central bank statement that may hint towards a rate hike next month. Apple Inc lost 0.9 percent as the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after it reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales in its fiscal second quarter on Tuesday. The drop came on the heels of a decline in sales for U.S. automakers for April and a soft first-quarter reading on U.S. growth last week. Even with the decline, Apple still managed to top earnings estimates in what has been a strong quarter for U.S. companies. Thomson Reuters data shows first-quarter growth is currently expected to be 14.2 percent, the best quarter since 2011, with 357 of S&P 500 companies having reported. “Think about the mixed message you had in the first quarter – GDP light, monthly auto sales light, iPhone sales light, so you’ve got extraneous negative data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “The first quarter is a blockbuster quarter for earnings on balance, which doesn’t necessarily line up with some of the incremental pieces of economic data that we’ve seen. That is the hard part to rationalize.” A report by payrolls processor ADP said private employers expanded their payrolls by 177,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since the 62,000 increase last October as they faced increasing difficulty finding qualified workers. Other data indicated the pace of growth in the U.S. economy’s service sector increased in April, led by a jump in new orders, according to an industry report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.45 points, or 0.16 percent, to 20,915.44, the S&P 500 lost 7.26 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,383.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,064.70. Europe’s STOXX 600 index lost 0.11 percent to retreat from a 20-month high and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.26 percent. The U.S. economic data helped push the dollar higher ahead of the Federal Reserve statement. While the central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged later today, investors will look for signs the it may hike in June. Traders are currently pricing in a 70.7-percent chance of a hike of at least a quarter-point next month, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. The dollar index rose 0.11 percent, with the euro down 0.13 percent to $1.0913. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.2946 percent, from 2.296 percent late on Tuesday. The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it is studying the possibility of issuing ultra long-term bonds. Oil prices rebounded from near 2017 lows after preliminary data showed a much larger-than-expected fall in U.S. crude stocks, reviving bullish sentiment about easing oversupply. U.S. crude fell 0.13 percent to $47.60 per barrel and Brent was last at $50.48, up 0.04 percent on the day. "
"2016-11-29",-9,"Losing the case would be a setback to the banks’ hopes of  bypassing Apple’s in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. Under Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (BEN.AX) also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. A successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic.  Apple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers’ privacy and data security. The company’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. In their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple’s favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees.  Sims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks’ complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple’s contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case. A representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) is the only one of Australia’s “Big Four” banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers.

U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports.

The index had pierced through the 21,000 mark five months ago and had breached the 20,000 milestone in January. All eyes will be on the quarterly performance of Dow-component Apple, which reports results after the closing bell. The iPhone maker’s shares were little changed. Tech has been the best performing sector this year, despite the sector going through bouts of volatility of late on rising valuation concerns. The tech index was up 0.27 percent in early trading.

The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its long-term average of 15 times. S&P 500 earnings are expected on average to have grown 10.8 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s been a very good earnings season so far which is helping to sustain U.S. stocks at record highs and offset any disappointment with Donald Trump’s inability to make progress on his growth policies,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda.

"2016-12-21",-14,"“Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple’s products,” Nokia said in a statement. Apple on Tuesday had taken legal action against Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) and Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc [GEGGIM.UL], accusing them of colluding with Nokia to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly from Apple. “We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products,” said Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock. “Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with.”   Acacia and Conversant did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Nokia was not immediately available to comment on the Apple lawsuit. The legal action by Nokia and Apple appear to mark a revival of the “smartphone patent wars” that began five years ago, when Apple filed a series of patent infringement cases against Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) around the world, with wins and losses on both sides. Acacia is a publicly traded patent licensing firm based in Newport Beach, California. One of its subsidiaries sued Apple for patent infringement and was awarded $22 million by a Texas jury in September. Similarly, Conversant, which claims to own thousands of patents, announced last week that a Silicon Valley jury had awarded one of its units a $7.3 million settlement in an infringement case against Apple involving two smartphone patents.     Nokia, once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, missed out on the transition to smartphones triggered by Apple’s introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its handset business to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) two years ago, leaving it with its telecom network equipment business and a bulging portfolio of mobile equipment patents. But this year, Microsoft sold its Nokia-feature phone business to a new company called HMD Global. Nokia agreed to a 10-year licensing deal with HMD, which continues to market low-cost Nokia phones and plans to introduce new Nokia smartphone models next year. "
"2017-04-19",-7,"The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple’s contract manufacturers underpaid royalties in the second quarter, but revenue was not affected as the amount was similar to what Apple claimed Qualcomm owed it.  San Diego-based Qualcomm also warned that it was unclear whether Apple’s contract manufacturers would underpay royalties owed in the third quarter, leading to the wider-than-usual profit forecast for the period. However, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a post-earnings call that the company expected to continue to be an “important supplier to Apple now and into the future”.  Qualcomm forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of 90 cents-$1.15 per share and revenue of $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    The royalties issue also weighed on Qualcomm’s second-quarter results.  The quarter included a $974 million reduction to revenue, or 48 cents per share, related to an arbitration over a royalties dispute with BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO). Revenue fell 9.6 pct to $5.02 billion in the three months ended March 26. (bit.ly/2ot17st) On an adjusted basis, Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.99 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $5.89 billion. Despite the litigation worries, revenue in the Qualcomm Technology Licensing business rose about 5 percent to $2.25 billion, ahead of the analysts’ estimate of $2.24 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.  The licensing unit contributed about 85 percent of the company’s earnings before taxes in 2016. Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder attributed the results in part to catch-up payments by customers who had earlier disputed them.  “It’s kind of a confusing mess right now on who’s coming and who’s going, that’s one of the reasons that you’re not seeing the stock perform better,” Snyder said. The company also said there was increased demand for its Snapdragon mobile chips, particularly in China, boosting revenue by 10 percent in its chip-making unit. Qualcomm’s market share in China is expected to increase to 65 percent this year from 50 percent in 2016, with share gains in OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and Meizu, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang wrote in a note. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.34 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.19.   "

"2016-10-31",-3,"By Frances  Yoon SEOUL, Nov 1 (IFR) - Korean bankers are fretting that Apple  may shun the country’s bond market after a local newspaper revealed that the secretive US phone maker had recently attempted to invest some of its vast cash pile in a local bank deal. The Maeil Business Newspaper reported on October 12 that Apple had placed an order to buy US dollar bonds of KEB Hana , one of South Korea’s largest banks in asset terms, but that the issuer had chosen not to accept the bid. The article infuriated Korean bankers, who said Apple was “extremely sensitive” about revealing how it managed its cash. “This is not a small issue. Apple could stop buying Korean paper entirely,” said a Korean banker, who did not participate in the KEB Hana deal. “This is super crazy.” Two sources close to the discussions told IFR that Apple had placed an order for KEB Hana’s three-year bonds on October 11 at around 90bp over US Treasuries. KEB Hana began marketing the 2019s at around 95bp over Treasuries and priced later that day at a tighter spread of 85bp to raise US$350m. Apple didn’t participate at the final price. US investors were allocated 31 percent of the three-year tranche, with some of the bonds going to Oracle and eBay, according to sources close to the deal. KEB Hana also marketed five-year notes at around 105bp over US Treasuries before pricing a $300 million tranche at a spread of 95bp. The longer piece drew a far smaller US following, with an allocation of just 7 percent. The bonds are rated A1/A (Moody‘s/S&P). The Maeil later revised its article, eliminating Apple’s identity. The story still cited JP Morgan Asset Management and Norway’s central bank as participants in the deal.  Never again  Concerns over Apple’s reaction stem from a similar case in 2014, when a Hyundai Capital Services executive told reporters that Apple had participated in its recent $500 million issue of three-year floating-rate notes. That, bankers said, upset Apple so much it refused to take part in any future bond issues from the company. “Apple never bought Hyundai Capital’s bonds again. Hyundai even went to Reno several times, but Apple would never meet them,” said a banker close to Hyundai. Apple, with its corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California, manages much of its cash and treasury operations through a subsidiary, Braeburn Capital, in Reno, Nevada. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Apple’s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities reached a record $238 billion as of September 24, according to a 10-K filing, making it the world’s biggest corporate investor. How Apple deploys its war chest is a sticking point for shareholders, who have demanded that the company shell out higher dividends. Apple’s current quarterly coupon of $0.57 per share represents a dividend yield of a little under 2 percent at the existing share price. Earlier this year, Apple committed to annual dividend increases and, on October 25, CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that it had returned $9.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases in the latest quarter. Apple announced a third successive quarter of declining iPhone sales last week and forecast lower-than-expected profit margins for this holiday season, despite projections of record sales. In the third quarter, Apple had a 12.5 percent share of the global smartphone market, accord to IDC. Korean rival Samsung led with a 20 percent market share. KEB Hana became one of South Korea’s largest banks asset-wise, following the completion in July of a merger between Hana Financial Group and Korea Exchange Bank. Hana bought KEB from US private-equity firm Lone Star in 2012. Citigroup, JP Morgan, Credit Agricole, Standard Chartered and UBS were joint bookrunners on the KEB Hana offering.

Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has rejected those claims and on Monday, while making no new comment on a case which is also being appealed by the Dublin government, the EU executive published an edited text of her judgment. Apple’s Irish tax arrangements have allowed it to pay tax at a rate of 3.8 percent on $200 billion of overseas profits over the past 10 years, according to a Reuters analysis of corporate filings. This is a fraction of the tax rate in the countries where Apple’s products are designed, made and sold. The low rate is achieved by Apple telling U.S. authorities that the profits are earned by Irish units. Meanwhile, Apple and Ireland agree the profits are generated in the United States. Among elements revealed by the Commission’s edited text was a record of a meeting between an Apple tax adviser and the Irish revenue service in 1990 in which they discussed setting an apparently arbitrary ceiling on the profit on which Apple’s Irish unit would be taxed locally. A year after Apple’s Irish branch had recorded a net profit of $270 million, its tax adviser proposed that no more than $30-40 million a year be taxed in Ireland, since the rest was attributable to technology and marketing businesses elsewhere. “[Apple’s tax adviser] confessed there was no scientific basis for the figure. However the figure was of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen to be a bona-fide proposal,” the excerpt cited in the Commission judgment read. The reference is part of the Commission’s case that Ireland gave Apple special treatment to induce it to base its European operations in the country and channel profits through Ireland. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it continued to believe‎ that “the Commission is retroactively applying a sweeping new state aid theory that is contrary to well-established legal principles, calls into question the tax rules of individual countries, and threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe‎. Moreover, it threatens to erode America’s corporate tax base.” The Irish government, which faces anger at home among opposition politicians that it is trying to turn down a huge tax windfall, separately published its legal arguments against the Commission’s case on Monday, saying Brussels had exceeded its powers and stepped on EU states’ sovereignty. Lawyers have previously said it was impossible to predict how EU courts will rule in an area that has not been tested before. Ireland’s tax treatments, now amended, have allowed Apple to avoid tax on tens of billions of dollars of non-U.S. profit. The Commission says the Irish units conducted key functions for developing the Apple brand and that Dublin underestimated their importance when determining their taxable profit. Apple says all the research and development takes place in the United States, which is also where key decisions about its products are made, meaning taxes should be paid there. Under U.S. tax law, however, companies pay tax on global profits but only when they are repatriated to the United States. The incoming Trump administration could change this. "

Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has rejected those claims and on Monday, while making no new comment on a case which is also being appealed by the Dublin government, the EU executive published an edited text of her judgment. Apple’s Irish tax arrangements have allowed it to pay tax at a rate of 3.8 percent on $200 billion of overseas profits over the past 10 years, according to a Reuters analysis of corporate filings. This is a fraction of the tax rate in the countries where Apple’s products are designed, made and sold. The low rate is achieved by Apple telling U.S. authorities that the profits are earned by Irish units. Meanwhile, Apple and Ireland agree the profits are generated in the United States.

"2017-04-05",-8,"* Imagination Technology crash  may be warning for Apple suppliers * Taiwan investors will anxiously follow Trump-Xi meetings By Faith Hung and Nichola Saminather TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan’s stock market has risen almost 20 percent over the past 15 months but gains have slowed recently as investors drawn by anticipation of the iPhone 8 pay more heed to risks previously dismissed. With about one-third of its stocks - including heavyweights Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Hon Hai Precision Industry - dependent on Apple Inc., Taiwan is vulnerable to sharp declines if the U.S. company turns away from the island for its major suppliers, or if the iPhone 8 doesn’t meet expectations. A fate similar to Imagination Technologies’ 70 percent plunge on Monday after Apple’s decision to drop the UK company as a major supplier cannot be ruled out. Export-dependent Taiwan could also see its fortunes reversed should U.S. President Donald Trump impose a border tax on imports, or if he labels the island a currency manipulator. A bad turn in Taiwan’s mercurial relations with China, its largest trading partner, could also make investors flee. “So far the market has ignored the protectionist threat and has focused on good aspects of Trump economic policy,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asian equity strategy at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, who has moderated his bullish stance on Taiwan this year due to concerns about U.S. policies and rising valuations. Trump has said he expects the meeting to be difficult given his belief China has taken advantage of U.S. trade policies. “Trump’s protectionism could force Taiwan’s supply chain to move to the U.S or raise their capital expenditures, without actually expanding their market very much,” said Tom Wu, chief investment officer of global investments for Yuanta Funds in Taipei. “That would put pressure on their earnings.” Taiwan had Asia’s strongest foreign fund inflows in January and February but was overtaken by India and South Korea in March, according to Thomson Reuters data. The inflows helped lift the Taiwan dollar about 6.7 percent this year, making it the region’s best performer after the Korean won. The currency’s strength poses a potential problem for the island’s exporters, but Taiwan’s central bank has been reluctant to intervene, not least because of the threat of being labeled a currency manipulator by the U.S. in a report on trading partners’ currency practices due this month. Foreign interest in some technology stocks “has driven part of that currency appreciation,” said Oliver Lee, investment director in Hong Kong at Old Mutual Global Investors, who is underweight tech stocks including TSMC. “But then, there is that underlying threat of Trump labeling them a currency manipulator.” Despite the risks, some fund managers remain optimistic, continuing to accumulate shares of TSMC and other Apple suppliers. “The story of the year is the iPhone 8 supply chain,” said Jeff Chang, chairman of Cathay Securities Investment Trust, Taiwan’s largest fund house. “Our funds will continue to add these shares.” "

"2017-02-15",-7,"MORE TOP NEWS  Trump administration proposes stricter Obamacare rules  Andrew Puzder out as Trump's Labor nominee  Lawmakers push for answers on Trump team's Russia ties  “He’s not wrong on everything,” said Munger, referring to Trump. “Just roll with it. If there’s a little danger, what the hell, you’re not going to live forever anyway.”  Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues.  He has been Buffett’s right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad.  Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).  On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the “joke” that Munger said airlines once were.  “The nice thing about the game we’re in is that we can keep learning,” Munger said.  “He’s changed when he’s buying airlines, and he’s changed when he’s buying Apple,” he said of Buffett.  “I don’t think we’ve gone crazy,” Munger added. “I think we’re adapting.”  Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job.  Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted.  “The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn’t recognize it,” Munger said. “I don’t think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo.”  He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co (AXP.N), saying people would be in a “state of delusion” for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade.  Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s (VRX.TO) business practices, including the Canadian drug company’s model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher.  Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant’s growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half.  “It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in,” Munger said. “It was too good to be true.”  "

She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. The U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. But domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. The Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. “The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. State media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. “I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. “The news did make me change my Apple habits,” he told Reuters. “For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.” "

"2017-11-21",-2,"“We have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law, therefore these apps have been removed from the App Store in China,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters. “These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.” The Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees censored technology, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. According to Reuters checks on Wednesday morning, Skype was not available in app stores in China overseen by Apple, Tencent Holdings Ltd 00700.HK and Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd QIHUy.SG. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google Play app store is not available in China. Microsoft, Tencent and Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China has increased scrutiny of internet applications this year, ordering firms to remove hundreds of apps that allow users to communicate confidentially or get around China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship and use overseas social media. Cyber authorities have also periodically interrupted services, such as Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) encrypted messenger app Whatsapp over the last two months. The authorities said such actions are designed to protect personal privacy and prevent online terrorist activity. Foreign tech lobbies and businesses operating in China have said internet rules are too strict and could hit their local operations. The actions are linked to real name authentication laws brought in earlier this year, requiring all network providers to verify the real names of users with state-issued IDs or passports. Separate data regulations also require companies to store user information within China, and make it accessible to authorities for surveillance purposes. Some foreign firms, including Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple have this year handed of parts of their business to local affiliates, often citing compliance with the new cybersecurity laws. Unlike similar services that are blocked, including Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Skype’s services are still available for those who already have the app installed. Chinese netizens on Tuesday evening took to Weibo to discuss Skype’s disappearance, which many criticized for being overly restrictive, despite the existence of local alternatives. "
"2017-08-30",-9,"Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its flash memory unit - the world’s No. 2 producer of NAND chips - to cover billions in losses at its bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse. Toshiba’s relationship with Western Digital, its joint venture partner for its chip business, has been rocky throughout the auction process - to the point that other bidders were favored first while the U.S. firm has also initiated legal action that threatens to derail any deal that does not have its consent. The revised offer is worth some 2 trillion yen ($18.2 billion). Bain and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc will be responsible for 1.1 trillion yen, while Apple will provide up to 400 billion yen and Japanese banks will give around 600 billion yen in support, one of the sources said. The proposal also calls for Toshiba to be part of the deal, investing 200 billion yen, the source said. By taking part in the bidding, Apple could help ensure a competitive supply chain and lessen its dependence on the chip division of Samsung, a key rival in the smart phone business.  Apple buys memory chips from multiple vendors, including market leader Samsung. Combined, Toshiba and Western Digital could be almost as large as Samsung’s memory unit, which could give a combined company more negotiating leverage against Apple.  “Apple is so big they need to multi-source,” said Frank Gillett, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. He said Apple needed to keep as many chip suppliers as possible in the market to keep prices competitive.  Bain’s new offer is designed to get around that problem as it will invite the state-backed investors - the Innovation Network of Japan (INCJ) and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) - to invest in the business only after any arbitration with Western Digital is settled, the source said. The bid trumps the 1.9 trillion yen offered by the Western Digital-led consortium, which also includes U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP. Banking sources have previously said, however, that Western Digital was working to get its proposal up to 2 trillion yen. Bain’s revised bid was first reported by Japanese broadcaster NHK which said it would be structured so that Bain and Toshiba would each hold 46 percent of the unit. The sources declined to be identified as talks concerning the auction were private. Toshiba, Bain, Western Digital, INCJ and Apple declined to comment. Representatives for DBJ and KKR were not immediately available for comment. People familiar with the matter have said Toshiba and Western Digital are bickering over the size of any potential stake to be held by the U.S. firm in the chip unit. For now, Western Digital plans to invest only through convertible bonds. Toshiba wants to reach a deal soon and it is not clear if it will give serious consideration to Bain’s new proposal. Failure to clinch a deal in the next few weeks could mean that it may not clear all necessary regulatory approvals by the end of the financial year in March. That would likely lead to Toshiba reporting negative net worth for two years in a row, increasing its chances of being delisted.     "

Apple rose nearly 1 percent, hitting a new record-high of $141.34, lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to yet another intraday high. The iPhone-maker’s stock could rise another 10 percent in six months, Barron’s wrote in an article posted Saturday. The U.S. stock market has been on record-setting spree since the election of Donald Trump as president, but the rally has faltered in recent weeks as investors fret over the lack of clarity on his proposals to reform taxes and cut regulation. Analysts have also said the Trump administration is spending too much of its political capital to pass a Republican-proposed healthcare bill, which may leave it wanting for support when it tries to reform the tax code. “With tax reform and infrastructure spending getting pushed to the end of this year or even next year, it will eventually weigh on sentiment and business confidence,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “Eventually, the market will lose patience,” Frederick said. At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.91 points, or 0.18 percent, at 20,951.53. The S&P 500 was up 0.93 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,379.18. The Nasdaq Composite was up 12.01 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,913.01. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.68 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil fell as investors continued to unwind bets on higher prices. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s conservative rate guidance is also keeping the market in check. All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans when he speaks later in the day. In an interview with Fox Business Network TV earlier on Monday, Evans said the Fed is on track to raise interest rates twice more this year. A host of Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. Last week, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time this year but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market. Among stocks, Movado fell 5.70 percent to $22.25 after the watchmaker’s quarterly results missed expectations.

"2017-09-08",-1,"However, if Western Digital remains a minority investor in the business, Apple, a top customer for Toshiba chips, is offering around 50 billion yen ($460 million) to a group including the U.S. firm to help finance a bid, one source said. Apple declined to comment, while a Western Digital spokeswoman said it could not comment on details of the talks. Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Western Digital, which jointly invests in Toshiba’s key chip plant, is leading a $17-18 billion bid for the chip business, sources familiar with the talks have said.   Sources said earlier in the week that Western Digital offered to step back from the consortium’s financing in return for a stronger position in their joint venture, and was roping in Apple for funding. But it has been unclear whether other parties in the consortium, which also includes U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) as well as Japanese government-backed investors,  would pay more to cover for the 15 billion yen that Western Digital had previously planned to pay as part of the bid. Sources have said Western Digital does want a future stake in the chip business, although it was unclear how much.  Toshiba executives, fearing that Western Digital was angling to eventually take over the chip business, are demanding that the U.S. company promise to limit the size of its stake in the company, sources said, requesting anonymity as talks were confidential. Toshiba’s board is now aiming to reach a final agreement with the consortium by Wednesday, sources have said.  The company is under pressure to clinch a deal soon and complete regulatory approvals by the end of the fiscal year in March to ensure it does not report negative net worth, or liabilities exceeding assets, for a second year running - a scenario that could result in delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Last week, Toshiba said it had not yet narrowed the pool of suitors and was also looking at a bid from U.S. private equity firm Bain as well as one from Taiwan’s Foxconn (2317.TW).  All three bids have involved Apple, Toshiba’s key memory chip customer, sources said. ($1 = 107.6800 yen) "

The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson’s order “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump’s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the “friend-of-the-court” brief this time around.

"2017-10-02",-3,"Trillions of dollars in sales are at stake as regulators ponder whether a fridge maker should pay a different rate for crucial patents than a carmaker, or whether a flat, fixed rate would be fairer. The patent fee model used by world No. 1 smartphone chip designer Qualcomm predominates in the tech industry and is based on how much value a technology adds to a product, but is opposed by Apple and others in Silicon Valley. Other models are in use and the EU aims to set a uniform one for Europe, opening a new front in a global dispute that has already seen multiple lawsuits between Apple and Qualcomm. Antti Peltomaki, deputy director general at the European Commission, told a conference last week that the EU hopes to finalise its guidelines by the end of the year. They will not be legally binding but could provide a basis if the EU executive decides to enact rules in future. The move is part of the bloc’s broader push to set new rules of the road for internet-connected devices beyond just computers and smartphones to cover cars, home automation and energy devices, aiming to ensure job creation and other economic benefits in the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) era. Qualcomm’s patent fee model is based on the widely used so-called “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” (FRAND) licensing model. The European Commission, however, has yet to make a final decision on which technology patent fee model it favours. Silicon Valley tech giants have sided with Apple, as have big Asian electronics makers who work for Apple, including Foxconn Technology Group.  Qualcomm, which holds what many experts see as the world's most lucrative smartphone patent portfolio, is backed by major mobile phone and network patent holders Ericsson and Nokia. (reut.rs/2yzqvCc) Apple, the automotive industry and product makers say a fairer approach is to link royalties to the cost of the smallest saleable unit. “It is not reasonable to charge more for use of the very same component in a Mercedes versus a Hyundai or a car versus a bicycle. This is discriminatory based on price of the end product, both within and outside of a particular product category,” Apple said of Qualcomm’s model in a May submission to the European Commission.  Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment for this story. Industry estimates show IoT systems could represent a market of more than $11 trillion per year by 2025. “There’s a lot of potential value at stake,” said Matthew Hunt, competition attorney with the law firm Bristows in London. Ericsson, once the world’s biggest mobile phone and network equipment maker, has fallen on hard times in the past decade in the face of stiff global competition. Still, with more than 42,000 patents giving it the largest number of mobile technology patents, it stands by the value-based licensing model. “We need to be able to be flexible to differentiate the price. Flexibility is absolutely necessary,” Patrick Hofkens, Ericsson’s director of intellectual property rights policy, said. Hofkens said that charging high royalty rates discourages product makers from adopting new innovations, while setting royalty rates too low undermines new technology developers from licensing their patents to industry standards bodies, which enable mass markets to take off.     “Price differentiation allows for lower prices for applications that do not use the patented technology as intensively as others,” the Ericsson executive said. The European Commission has a tough balancing act, said Bristows’ Hunt. “For any model, the main difficulty is going to be how to determine a fair rate. This has proven complicated enough in the mobile telecoms industry already, and it’s only going to get harder with new IoT enabled products,” he said.  Qualcomm’s approach sets royalty rates based on the proportion of ‘added value’ the patented technology provides to the completed product.   Its previous patent licensing deal with Apple, for example, allowed it to take a percentage of the overall selling price for the iPhone, in exchange for supplying it with modem chips. Lobbying group the App Association (ACT), whose sponsors include Apple, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft, urged the Commission not to rush into setting new guidelines.  IP Europe, another lobbying group whose members include Ericsson, Airbus, Nokia and Orange, says patent holders deserve a fair compensation. “When they are contributors to a platform, they have expectations of fair remuneration,” the group’s executive secretary Francisco Mingorance said."

"2016-12-06",-11,"“The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. The U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. But domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. The Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. “The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. State media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. “I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. “The news did make me change my Apple habits,” he told Reuters. “For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.” "

"2017-11-06",-15,"By Andrew Chung Nov 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to step back into the years-long feud over patents between the world’s top smartphone makers, declining to hear Samsung’s appeal of a lower court ruling that reinstated a jury award of about $120 million in favor of Apple. The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case. The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added. In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.” Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal. The Trump administration backed Apple’s view. "

"2017-09-20",2,"* BOJ decision awaited, with no policy changes expected * Apple suppliers skid; banks, financial shares rise TOKYO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Thursday, boosted by gains on Wall Street and a weaker yen after the Federal Reserve signalled it still expects to raise interest rates one more time this year. The Nikkei was up 0.8 percent at the end of morning trading at 20,479.88 points, its highest since August 2015. The dollar was 0.3 percent higher at 112.57 yen, touching its highest levels since mid-July, after the U.S. central bank said it will begin to reduce its balance sheet from next month and indicated that one more rate increase by the end of the year remains possible despite a recent bout of low inflation. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up to mark its seventh straight record close, while the S&P 500 eked out a gain to its sixth record finish in the last seven sessions. Later on Thursday, the Bank of Japan will deliver its own policy verdict, but is not expected to change any of its settings or guidance. BOJ policymakers are widely expected to reassure investors that the bank will lag well behind its U.S. counterpart in scaling back its massive stimulus as the modest economic recovery has yet to boost inflation anywhere near its 2 percent target. “No one is really paying much attention to the BOJ today, but rather there is a lot of focus on what the Fed said overnight,” said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Still, markets will look for clues from  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s post-meeting news conference on how possible changes in the political landscape could affect monetary policy. Government sources have told Reuters that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering calling a snap election for as early as next month and will pledge to use some of the revenue from a scheduled sales tax hike in 2019 to fund spending on education and child care. “We have to see if any policy promises are realized before we can say whether it will have an effect on the market,” Fujito said.

Asked about the total size of the Foxconn-led offer, he declined to give a figure, saying only that it was “very close” to other bids. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the world’s second-largest producer of NAND chips, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. Foxconn, however, has not been seen as a frontrunner for the unit due to its deep ties with China, where it manufactures much of its products. The Japanese government has said it will block any deal that would risk the transfer of key chip technology out of the country. Gou said that the Foxconn-led consortium contained no Chinese capital and had the advantage of not inviting as much antitrust scrutiny as other suitors. He also played down potential opposition from the Japanese government to the bid. “The key is that we are all customers, we are users,” he said. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, and its Japanese unit Sharp Corp would have a combined stake of not more than 40 percent, he added. Representatives for Apple and the other U.S. firms named by Gou could not be immediately reached for comment outside of regular business hours. Sharp declined to comment. SoftBank declined to comment. Toshiba was not immediately available for comment. The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund and the group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) or more, the source said. The news helped Toshiba’s shares climb 9 percent on Monday. The stock is still down 26 percent from levels in late December, before it flagged big losses at its Westinghouse unit. The laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate aims to name a winner  at a board meeting on June 15. Tokyo, however, has been asking Toshiba to postpone the decision as the government-led consortium has yet to finalize its proposal. Some sources have said that the state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan, is also exploring a potential consortium with Bain Capital, though it is unclear what other firms would also be members of that group.  Western Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to a successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan.  But Western Digital and Toshiba have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids. Toshiba has favored a separate bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

The Nikkei was effectively flat, down 0.1 percent at 20,377.29 by the midday break, moving away from a two-year high of 20,481.27 hit last week. Meantime, the broader Topix edged up 0.1 percent to 1,673.99. North Korea’s foreign minister said U.S. President Donald Trump had declared war on the country and it reserved the right to take countermeasures, including shooting down U.S. bombers even if they are not in its airspace. The escalating war of words between North Korea and the United States lifted investor appetite for the perceived safe-haven yen. The dollar was at 111.76 yen after coming off a high of 112.530 the previous day. “Although the market has become immune to such geopolitical tensions, as the Japanese market was enjoying gains from last week, the latest remarks have provided a reason to take profits,” said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. Tracking weak U.S. tech shares, chip-related stocks Advantest Corp and Tokyo Electron Ltd tumbled 2.4 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively. TDK Corp dropped 1.1 percent and Hitachi Ltd shed 1.3 percent. Apple suppliers Murata Manufacturing Co declined 2.5 percent, Taiyo Yuden stumbled 4.6 percent, while Alps Electric dropped 1.0 percent, after Apple Inc fell overnight following a report that the company had told suppliers to scale back shipments of parts for its upcoming iPhone X. Bucking the weakness, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp rose 2.0 percent after the company said that it will buy back up to 30 million of its own shares, or 1.5 percent of outstanding stocks. Japan Post Holdings Co was flat at 1,349 yen after it set the price for its follow-up share sale at 1,322 yen per share, a 2 percent discount to Monday’s closing price of 1,349 yen. [ In a rare move, the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday corrected the date from which it will include Japan Post shares in the Topix index. It said it would include the shares of Japan Post in the Topix on Sept. 29, changing from Oct. 30 that it initially announced. The exchange’s guidelines say it will add new shares to the index on the share delivery date, which was Sept. 29 for the Japan Post deal, but the exchange made an “anomaly announcement” to allow fund managers and securities firms enough time for index rebalancing. The TSE said its initial announcement caused confusion among market participants who were preparing index adjustments based on its usual guidelines. “We decided to change to Sept. 29 after they expressed their concerns,” said Kazuhiro Nishimukai, director of information services at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

"2017-09-20",-3,"* Apple down on reports of connectivity issues with its smartwatch * Bed Bath & Beyond tumbles after earnings, sales miss * Indexes down: Dow 0.01 pts, S&P 0.07 pts, Nasdaq 0.41 pts (Adds details, comment, updates prices) By Sruthi Shankar Sept 20 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow were little changed on Wednesday but hovered near record levels as investors waited to hear from the Federal Reserve on future interest rate hikes this year while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was pulled lower by a drop in Apple. The iPhone maker’s shares fell 2.5 percent and was the biggest drag on all three indexes after reports that the company admitted to connectivity issues with its latest smartwatch. Investors focused on Fed’s policy statement and projections due to be released at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference half an hour later, which will be closely watched for views on inflation. The central bank is likely to keep interest rate unchanged and say that it will start unwinding its holdings of about $4.2 trillion in bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Inflation has remained below the Fed’s 2-percent target rate, but a recent data showed uptick in domestic consumer prices, which raised the chances of a December rate hike by more than 50 percent for the first time since July. “The Fed is continuing to confirm the narrative that the lack of inflation has been somewhat transitory and expect inflation to pick up,” said Emily Roland, head of investment research at John Hancock Investments in Boston. “Certainly that will have a big influence as we look towards the readings on inflation going forward.” Traders were betting on a 55.8 percent chance of a December hike, compared with 37.3 percent a month ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. At 11:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.88 points, or 0.01 percent, at 22,368.92, the S&P was down 1.73 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,504.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 26.50 points, or 0.41 percent, at 6,434.82. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 0.51 percent gain in the telecom services sector. The technology index was the biggest laggard, weighed down by Apple, Adobe and Western Digital. Adobe fell 4 percent after the Photoshop maker’s revenue forecast came in line with estimates. General Mills was down about 5 percent after its quarterly profit missed estimates, hurt by lower sales of its yogurts and cereals in North America. Shares of other food companies, including JM Smucker and Kellogg, were down about 2 percent. Western Digital slipped more than 4 percent after Japan’s embattled Toshiba agreed to sell its semiconductor business to a group led by private equity firm Bain Capital. The stock was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P technology index. Bed Bath & Beyond sank 17 percent to its lowest since 2009 after the home furnishing retailer reported earnings and sales below estimates, prompting a slew of price target cuts. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,684 to 1,010. On the Nasdaq, 1,515 issues rose and 1,177 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)"
"2017-11-03",-8,"* Unemployment rate falls to 4.1 pct from 4.2 pct * Apple’s iPhone X goes on sale worldwide * Dow down 0.07 pct, S&P off 0.06 pct, Nasdaq 0.14 pct (Changes comment, updates prices) By Sruthi Shankar Nov 3 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow were flat in late morning trading on Friday after October payrolls data sparked concerns about tepid wage growth while a jump in Apple supported the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Apple gained as robust initial demand for its new iPhone X allayed investor worries and strong results a day earlier. The company briefly surpassed $900 billion in market capitalization after the stock opened at a record high of $174. The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed that average hourly earnings slipped by one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms. That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent. “If there’s one thing I would focus on, it is the fact you’re really not seeing the wage inflation,” said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc. “The wage numbers are becoming increasing more important than the monthly payrolls number itself.” Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target and could raise concerns about consumer spending. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs after a hurricane-ravaged September, but was below economists’ expectations for a 310,000 rise. At 10:49 a.m. ET (1449 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.35 points, or 0.07 percent, at 23,500.91 and the S&P 500 was down 1.44 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,578.41. The Nasdaq Composite was up 9.67 points, or 0.14 percent, at 6,724.61, helped by Apple and Starbucks. The markets have had a busy week. On Thursday, President Donald Trump tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next head of the U.S. central bank and House Republicans disclosed their long-delayed plans for tax cuts. The Dow and the Nasdaq were on track to post weekly gains, while the S&P was on pace to report a small weekly loss. Starbucks was up 2.6 percent after dipping earlier following results a day earlier. AIG fell 4.69 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves. More than three-fourths of the S&P 500 companies have reported results, with 72.4 percent topping profit estimates, above the 72 percent beat-rate in the past four quarters. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,592 to 1,137. On the Nasdaq, 1,469 issues fell and 1,182 advanced. "
"2017-09-12",-12,"* Storm damage concerns ease as Irma weakens * Financials gain as bond yields rise * Apple slips in volatile trade during iPhone launch event * Indexes up: Dow 0.28 pct, S&P 0.34  pct, Nasdaq 0.34 pct (Updates to close, adds commentary) By Sinead Carew Sept 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 hit a record closing high for the second day in a row on Tuesday, with financial stocks leading the charge, but gains were stunted by a decline in Apple Inc shares after it unveiled its latest iPhone. Nasdaq also clocked a record closing high despite weakness from Apple. Investors were more comfortable with riskier assets as concerns about U.S. tensions with North Korea eased and the financial impact from Hurricane Irma appeared less severe than feared last week. The financial sector was the S&P 500’s biggest driver as bank stocks were helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields, while the utilities and real estate sectors lost ground. “It’s a better environment for risk assets. As long as these two issues North Korea and the hurricane - have receded as concerns, it gives investors a green light to focus on stronger fundamentals,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.49 points, or 0.28 percent, to 22,118.86, the S&P 500 gained 8.37 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,496.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.02 points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,454.28. Concerns about Hurricane Irma’s impact receded as it weakened to a tropical depression, while investors shrugged off fresh developments related to North Korea. “A lot of it is the realization that the latest hurricane wasn’t as devastating in the U.S. as people feared,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. Apple’s shares closed a volatile trading session 0.4 percent lower at $160.82 after rising as high as $163.96, after it unveiled its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone. Apple’s release date of Nov. 3 was later than some investors had expected. While some investors cited worries about whether Apple would face supply shortages, others said traders were just taking profits. “There were no blockbuster surprises although what they’re doing with the products is all pretty good,” said Ghriskey. The iPhone maker was the second-biggest drag on the S&P behind McDonald‘s, which fell more than 3 percent on concerns about its third-quarter results. Most of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the telecom services index clocking the biggest gain with a 1.4 percent rise. Financials, the biggest driver on the day, rose 1.2 percent, helped by a 1.8-percent jump in the S&P Bank subsector. Investors in banks, whose profits are boosted by higher rates, were reacting to a jump U.S. Treasury 10-year yields to a three-week high after a 10-year note auction. Also, Goldman Sachs unveiled a growth plan that could add as much as $5 billion in revenue annually. The S&P Utilities and Real Estate sectors were the laggards of the day, with 1.8 percent and 1.2 percent declines, as investors shied away from interest rate- sensitive stocks. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.89 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 5.79 billion 20-day average. (Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Dan Grebler and Nick Zieminski)"

"2017-08-30",-9,"Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its flash memory unit - the world’s No. 2 producer of NAND chips - to cover billions in losses at its bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse. Toshiba’s relationship with Western Digital, its joint venture partner for its chip business, has been rocky throughout the auction process - to the point that other bidders were favored first while the U.S. firm has also initiated legal action that threatens to derail any deal that does not have its consent. The revised offer is worth some 2 trillion yen ($18.2 billion). Bain and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc will be responsible for 1.1 trillion yen, while Apple will provide up to 400 billion yen and Japanese banks will give around 600 billion yen in support, one of the sources said. The proposal also calls for Toshiba to be part of the deal, investing 200 billion yen, the source said. By taking part in the bidding, Apple could help ensure a competitive supply chain and lessen its dependence on the chip division of Samsung, a key rival in the smart phone business.  Apple buys memory chips from multiple vendors, including market leader Samsung. Combined, Toshiba and Western Digital could be almost as large as Samsung’s memory unit, which could give a combined company more negotiating leverage against Apple.  “Apple is so big they need to multi-source,” said Frank Gillett, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. He said Apple needed to keep as many chip suppliers as possible in the market to keep prices competitive.  Bain’s new offer is designed to get around that problem as it will invite the state-backed investors - the Innovation Network of Japan (INCJ) and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) - to invest in the business only after any arbitration with Western Digital is settled, the source said. The bid trumps the 1.9 trillion yen offered by the Western Digital-led consortium, which also includes U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP. Banking sources have previously said, however, that Western Digital was working to get its proposal up to 2 trillion yen. Bain’s revised bid was first reported by Japanese broadcaster NHK which said it would be structured so that Bain and Toshiba would each hold 46 percent of the unit. The sources declined to be identified as talks concerning the auction were private. Toshiba, Bain, Western Digital, INCJ and Apple declined to comment. Representatives for DBJ and KKR were not immediately available for comment. People familiar with the matter have said Toshiba and Western Digital are bickering over the size of any potential stake to be held by the U.S. firm in the chip unit. For now, Western Digital plans to invest only through convertible bonds. Toshiba wants to reach a deal soon and it is not clear if it will give serious consideration to Bain’s new proposal. Failure to clinch a deal in the next few weeks could mean that it may not clear all necessary regulatory approvals by the end of the financial year in March. That would likely lead to Toshiba reporting negative net worth for two years in a row, increasing its chances of being delisted.     "
"2017-08-30",-4,"Berkshire has disclosed a roughly $20 billion stake in Apple. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM at the end of 2016 and sold about a third of them in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported in May, citing Buffett.  Buffett also said Wednesday that he continued to have faith in investments in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo. Berkshire has become Bank of America’s largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. When asked if U.S. food company Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) would buy Mondelez (MDLZ.O), Buffett said: “I think the answer is no on that.” He also said Kraft Heinz, which Berkshire controls along with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, would not again seek to buy Unilever Plc (ULVR.L).  Kraft Heinz withdrew its proposal for a $143 billion merger with larger rival Unilever Plc, the companies said in February. Following a six-month cooling off period required by UK takeover law which expired this month, there has been speculation over whether Kraft Heinz would come back for another shot at Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.  “That was a misunderstanding, basically. We will not make hostile takeover offers, and we did not intend that to be hostile, but it turned out it was, and we immediately the next day, when I learned about it, we called it off,” Buffett said on Kraft Heinz’s bid.  When asked why he was silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, Buffett said: “I am not in the business of attacking any president, nor do I think I should be.” He had supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election.

"2017-08-02",3,"* Honda surges after company raises FY profit outlook By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose to a 1-1/2-week high on Wednesday, supported by strong domestic earnings as well as a rally among Apple’s suppliers after the iPhone maker reported robust profits. The Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher at 20,080.04, its highest closing level since July 21. Apple suppliers soared, with Murata Manufacturing rising 4.9 percent, Taiyo Yuden rising 4.4 percent and TDK Corp gaining 2.8 percent after Apple delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings and signalled that its upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone lineup is on schedule. Honda Motor Co gained 2.8 percent after Japan’s No.3 automaker raised its full-year operating profit forecast thanks to solid demand in Asia. While Japanese stocks have been supported by strong earnings, some traders expect the Nikkei to continue to hover around the 20,000 mark as investors have grown cautious about the risk of a further rise in the yen. “So far, companies are reporting better-than-expected results, but such positive catalysts are offset by worries about a strong yen,” said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities in Tokyo. “When the Nikkei is trading in a narrow range, retail investors are buying when the index is in the lower level in the range. Foreign investors would have chased the market higher if the yen weakened, but that’s not happening right now.” On Wednesday afternoon, the dollar was 0.3 percent higher at 110.75 yen, after it touched a nearly seven-week low of 109.920 yen overnight. The dollar has been weighed down by political turmoil gripping Washington and largely uninspiring U.S. economic data, which is adding to uncertainty about the pace of future U.S. Federal Reserve policy tightening. Mining stocks underperformed after oil prices fell, with rising U.S. fuel inventories pulling U.S. crude back below $50 per barrel. Inpex Corp and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co both shed 0.5 percent. The broader Topix advanced 0.4 percent to 1,634.38 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.3 percent to 14,540.00.

"2017-09-02",0,"Huawei will launch the Mate 10 and its sister phone, the Mate 10 Pro, in Munich on Oct. 16, Yu confirmed. He declined to detail new features, but the phones are expected to boast large, 6-inch-plus full-screen displays, tech blogs predict. Artificial intelligence (AI) built into its new chips can help make phones more personalized, or anticipate the actions and interests of their users, Yu said. As examples, he said AI can enable real-time language translation, heed voice commands, or take advantage of augmented reality, which overlays text, sounds, graphics and video on real-world images phone users see in front of them. Yu believes the new Kirin 970 chip’s speed and low power can translate into features that will give its phones an edge over the Apple iPhone 8 series, set to be unveiled on Sept. 12, and Samsung’s range of top-line phones announced this year. Huawei is the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple. “Compared with Samsung and Apple, we have advantages,” Yu said in an interview during the annual IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin. “Users are in for much faster (feature) performance, longer battery life and more compact design.” The company asserts its newly announced Kirin 970 chip will preserve battery life on phones by up to 50 percent. Huawei describes the new chip as the first Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for smartphones. It brings together classic computing, graphics, image and digital signal processing power that have typically required separate chips, taking up more space and slowing interaction between features within phones. Most importantly, Huawei aims to use the Kirin chips to differentiate its phones from a vast sea of competitors, including Samsung, who overwhelming rely on rival Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm, the market leader in mobile chip design. Among major phone makers, only Apple and Huawei now rely on their own core processors. The 970 is designed by Huawei’s HiSilicon chip design business and built using the most advanced 10 nanometer production lines of contract manufacturer TSMC.

European shares, however, were seen easing from five-month highs. London’s FTSE futures were off 0.4 percent, while S&P E-mini futures dipped 0.2 percent, suggesting a softer opening on Wall Street later in the day. Apple Inc said pre-orders for the 10th anniversary iPhone X, which started on Friday, were “off the charts”, a blessing for Asian suppliers such as South Korea’s LG Display and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . Tech stocks were the top gainers in MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which was up 0.4 percent. Samsung Electronics led the charts with a rise of 1.8 percent. Energy stocks did well too, with Brent crude at around $60.50 a barrel, its highest since July 2015, after Saudi Arabia agreed to support the extension of a global oil production cut agreement. Japan’s Nikkei ended little changed but remained around its highest level since mid-1996, having soared 8 percent in October so far. But Chinese shares bucked the trend, with the Shanghai Composite Index set for its worst day since Aug. 11. Global share markets have been on an uptrend since the start of the year, helped by solid corporate earnings and positive economic data across major countries. The world share index has surged 17.6 percent so far in 2017, on track for its best showing since 2013. “The continuation of quantitative easing (QE) in Europe at a time when Japan remains locked on QE and the U.S. is only tightening gradually highlights that global monetary conditions will remain easy for a long while yet,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital. “This, along with strong economic growth and earnings, largely explains why global share markets are so strong.” In the United States, Alphabet , Amazon and Microsoft all jumped last week after solid quarterly performances, sending U.S. indexes higher. Amazon soared 13.2 percent on Friday and was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Apple is due to report on Thursday. The dollar index was a 0.14 percent softer, with investors focused on the impending appointment of the next Federal Reserve chair, with speculation rife that Fed governor Jerome Powell is the favoured candidate. Markets see Powell as less hawkish, and wagers that he will be the chosen one tempered the dollar’s advances and dragged 2-year Treasury yields off a nine-year top. An announcement is expected this week. In Europe, political uncertainty in Spain and the European Central Bank’s decision to extend its stimulus further weighed on the common currency, marking its biggest weekly loss of the year. The euro steadied at $1.1613, not far from $1.1573 which was the lowest since July 20. Spain sacked Catalonia’s regional government on Friday, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election after Catalonia declared independence from Spain. The ECB’s decision last week to extend its bond purchases into September 2018 also hurt the euro, driving yields on two-year German bunds lower. The premium that 2-year U.S. debt pays over 2-year German yields is now the widest since mid-1999, making it more attractive to borrow in euros to buy dollars. In commodities, copper held near a two-week low. Spot gold was trading 0.2 percent lower at $1,270.21 per ounce. U.S. crude was unchanged at $53.90 a barrel. "

Stocks lost a little ground late in the session after the Wall Street Journal reported that Special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington to investigate allegations of Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections. The S&P 500 information technology index, which has led other sectors in 2017, dipped 0.35 percent. Apple lost 1.0 percent after hitting a record high the day before. It and Amazon.com, down 0.90 percent, weighed more than any other stocks on the S&P 500. Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla jumped 6.50 percent reporting quarterly results above Wall Street’s expectations.

The S&P 500 has risen 11 percent in 2017 and is trading at 18 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “Earnings are supporting this market and consumers are supporting it from a macroeconomic standpoint,” said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. “This is a Goldilocks economy, good enough to push the market higher, no bubbles in sight.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.04 percent, or 9.86 points, to end at 22,026.1 points, an all-time high. On Wednesday, the Dow rose above 22,000 for the first time. “When you hit these major milestones it’s not unusual to trade sideways for a few days,” Blancato said. The S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent to 2,472.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.35 percent to 6,340.34.

"2017-08-09",-8,"Japanese electronics makers have struggled to compete against their Asian rivals, ceding market share to cut-price Chinese competitors at the low end of the market but also failing to innovate enough to stay ahead in high-end products. Japan Display has been caught out by a swift change in consumption trends, with handset makers shifting to the thinner and flexible OLED displays from LCDs for high-end models. It plans to start mass-producing OLED panels for smartphones only in 2019, while Apple, whose orders account for more than half of the firm’s current sales, is widely expected to begin adopting OLED for its iPhones later this year. “We now see no future for the smartphone panel business without OLED,” CEO Nobuhiro Higashiiriki said at a quarterly results briefing. “We have strategically changed our direction.” In the red over the past three years, Japan Display posted a net loss of 31.46 billion yen ($286.13 million) in the quarter ended June, versus a 11.8 billion yen loss a year ago. Higashiiriki said the firm will seek partnership with global companies, potentially Chinese panel makers. “Partnership could take various forms,” with a capital injection among options, he said. While Chinese display makers are seen by analysts as the most likely candidates for investing in Japan Display as they rapidly expand their presence in the display market with state support, there could be protectionist concerns. There are doubts if Japan Display’s main investor - the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) - would allow Chinese players to take a stake in the firm, said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan. INCJ helped form Japan Display five years ago by combining the ailing display units of Sony Corp (6758.T), Hitachi (6501.T) and Toshiba Corp (6502.T). But the firm’s continuing struggle questions the validity of government interventions in business.  Quick and bold investment decisions that are crucial in the competitive tech industry are often hard to make for funds with taxpayers’ money, analysts said. As of now, INCJ is expected to play a major role in groups that are the front-runners for Toshiba’s planned sale of its $18 billion chip business. Japan Display said it had received a new line of credit worth 107 billion yen from its main lenders to finance the operational overhaul. That is on top of 75 billion yen in aid last year from INCJ. The company said 3,500 of the 3,700 job cuts will come from overseas, but declined to specify locations. It has a total of five plants abroad - in China, the Philippines and Taiwan. "
"2017-08-08",8,"* SeaWorld hits record low after revenue miss * Dow on track for 11th straight day of gains * Indexes up: Dow 0.14 pct, S&P 0.25 pct, Nasdaq 0.44 pct (Updates to open) By Tanya Agrawal Aug 8 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P were off sessions highs in Tuesday afternoon trading after scaling new records on gains in Apple and advances in JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Apple rose as much as 1.91 percent to an all-time high and provided the biggest boost to all three major indexes. Goldman Sachs was up 0.77 percent and JPMorgan 0.61 percent. Tuesday’s rise puts the Dow on track to post its 11th straight session of gains - the blue-chip index’s longest streak for consecutive gains since February - driven by a strong quarterly earnings season. Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected with analysts now expecting S&P 500 earnings to have expanded 11.8 percent, compared with 8 percent at the start of July, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve had an exceptional second-quarter earnings season which has given investors confidence,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve. “But with earnings coming to a close, no major economic data and seasonality issues, trading volume is expected to be slightly diminished.” Trading volume is also expected to be relatively tepid with no major legislation expected as the U.S. Congress is on vacation and with summer setting in. The S&P hasn’t moved more than 0.5 percent since July and has fallen more than 1 percent only twice this year. At 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.74 points, or 0.14 percent, at 22,150.16, the S&P 500 was up 6.33 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,487.24. The Nasdaq Composite was up 28.11 points, or 0.44 percent, at 6,411.88. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the technology and financial sectors leading the advancers. The Labor Department said U.S. job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped to a record high in June and was at the highest level since December 2000. Also on investors’ radar is the rush of retail earnings this week and next, amid Amazon.com’s rapid rise. “With retail earnings, it would be interesting to see if expectations have fallen enough for these companies to beat them,” Wiegand said. And on Tuesday, shares of Michael Kors jumped 22.16 percent beat lowered Wall Street expectations for profit and raised its full-year revenue forecast, while Ralph Lauren rose 10.56 percent following revenue and profit beats. Macy‘s, Kohl‘s, JC Penney are expected to report results this week, with Wal-Mart, Target due next week. Dean Foods slumped 19.10 percent after the largest U.S. dairy processor’s quarterly results came in below estimates. SeaWorld Entertainment plunged as much as 18.44 percent to a record low after the theme park company’s quarterly revenue missed expectations. Avis Budget Group fell 7.31 percent as the car rental company cut its full-year profit view. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,480 to 1,294.

"2017-09-21",-3,"Investors increased bets the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise rates again this year after the central bank’s statement on Wednesday and were also assessing its decision to start reducing its roughly $4.2 trillion in U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. U.S. President Donald Trump opened the door to blacklisting people and entities doing business with North Korea, further tightening the screws on Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “The Fed had investors on edge already. Ratcheting up of North Korea tensions can put investors in a little more of a risk-off mode,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners, in Huntersville, NC. However, with the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX closing at its lowest level in nearly two months at 9.67, Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, said the market is not reflecting risks such as  U.S.-North Korea tensions and high valuations. The market is “very complacent and very comfortable in its own skin right now and not really concerned about risk much at all,” said Cecchini: “I‘m worried about that.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 53.36 points, or 0.24 percent, to 22,359.23, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.64 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,500.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 33.35 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,422.69.     Investors were pricing in about a 70 percent chance of a December hike, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, up from about 51 percent just prior to the Fed statement. Only two of the 11 major S&P sectors - financials .SPSY and industrials .SPLRCI - were higher, with gains of 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent. The consumer staples index .SPLRCS was the biggest decliner, down 0.97 percent drop. The S&P has risen about 11.7 percent so far this year, helped by strong corporate profits and lingering optimism among some investors that Trump will cut taxes for businesses. This has boosted valuations. The S&P is trading at roughly 17.6 times expected earnings, well above its 10-year average of 14.3, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “It’s very hard for me to see a tremendous catalyst for the upside, although I also don’t see that massive catalyst to create a crack to the downside,” said Cantor’s Cecchini.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The weakening of Irma, the second major natural disaster to hit the United States after Hurricane Harvey, allayed concerns about the severity of its financial impact. “Investors have gained confidence that the worst is over and concerns over Irma’s economic impact seem to have disappeared for the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. All eyes will be on Apple as it prepares to unveil the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, whose sales will also have repercussions on its rivals and many suppliers. Apple shares dipped 0.3 percent ahead of the event, scheduled to start at 1:00 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). At 9:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.64 points, or 0.29 percent, at 22,122.01 and the S&P 500 was up 6.76 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,494.87. The Nasdaq Composite was up 16.20 points, or 0.25 percent, at 6,448.46. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.03 percent rise in materials index. DowDupont rose 3 percent after the company said it was making changes to a plan of splitting itself into three. The stock gave the biggest boost to the S&P. The market also seemed to shrug off North Korea’s threat that the United States would soon face the “greatest pain” it had ever experienced in the wake of the U.N. stepping up sanctions against Pyongyang on Monday due to its nuclear tests. North Korea on Tuesday rejected the U.N. Security Council resolution, which imposed a ban on the country’s textile exports and capped crude oil imports. “Although North Korea is a threat and can make the market nervous because of uncertainty, more and more global powers are coming on board, taking the pressure off of just the U.S. dealing with it. About that, the investors feel good,” Bakhos said. Sage Therapeutics slumped more than 19 percent after its drug to treat a life-threatening seizure disorder failed in a late-stage trial. Teva rose 5.24 percent after the drugmaker agreed to sell its contraceptive brand, Paragard, for $1.1 billion to a unit of Cooper Cos, whose stock was flat. In economic data, the Labor Department is expected to release its monthly job openings and labor turnover survey report for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. Job openings rose to 6.163 million in June.

Apple dropped 1.3 percent on concerns about the newly launched iPhone X’s hefty price tag and its later-than-expected availability date of Nov. 3. The stock was the top drag on all the three major indexes. Also helping the market was potential progress on tax reform as President Donald Trump prepared to host Democratic and Republican House lawmakers at the White House, seeking to build support on the agenda. Wall Street is coming off a two-day rally that resulted in the three major indexes finishing at all-time highs on Tuesday and the S&P touching a record intra-day high. The indexes have stayed near record levels this year despite periodic setbacks caused by turmoil in the White House, the timing of U.S. interest rate hikes, doubts about Trump’s ability to push through his pro-business reforms, and lately, tensions over North Korea. “The market’s slowed the treadmill to a slight pace from the run it was on, nothing really negative,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. “The likely driver today is going to be a little bit of a late-day rally. But not very large.” At 11:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.22 points, flat on a percent basis, at 22,119.08 and the S&P 500 was down 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,495.77. The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.82 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,450.46. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with a rise in oil prices helping the energy index gain 0.6 percent. Centene rose about 6 percent after the health insurer said it would buy privately held Fidelis Care for $3.75 billion. Western Digital was the biggest S&P loser, down 5.3 percent after Toshiba said it would focus on selling its chips unit to a group led by Bain Capital and SK Hynix . Equifax dropped 5 percent as investors brushed off the company’s chief executive apology for a breach that may have compromised personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers and a reassurance to “make changes” to avoid further hacks. Nordstrom gained 6.3 percent after Reuters reported the Nordstrom family had selected private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners to help take the high-end retailer private.

The State Council statement said Li had encouraged Gou to further invest in high-end research and development as well as in supply chain production in China.     Despite the recent rapprochement between U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping over North Korea issues, China remains a competitor to the United States under Trump’s “America first” agenda. Li’s visit comes weeks after Gou and other senior Foxconn executives discussed significant investments in the United States at the White House. When contacted about the U.S. investment, Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (2317.TW), declined to comment. In a statement issued after Li’s visit, the company said it was committed to investing in China.  Analysts have said that Gou treads a fine line in balancing his business empire that straddles both the United States and China.  Foxconn is a major supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O). China is the base for its assembly of Apple’s iconic iPhones, and where Foxconn employs about a million people.  Foxconn is also in the running as a suitor for Toshiba Corp’s (6502.T) chip business.

The British central bank is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point rise in interest rates from record lows at 1200 GMT, even though economic growth appears weaker than before any increase in borrowing costs in the past 20 years. With a hike largely priced in, sterling was barely changed against a marginally weaker dollar. European government bond yields inched up while stocks in the region edged back after hitting two-year highs on Wednesday. “The interesting thing about the BoE is the vote and the size of the majority, and secondly the context around that which we will get from the inflation report,” said JPMorgan Asset Management’s International CIO of fixed income Nick Gartside. “What those two things will point to is whether it is a one-off move or is indeed the start of a mini-hiking cycle. Our sense at the moment is that it is the start of a mini-hiking cycle.” The dollar meanwhile gave up some of the gains that have lifted it to a 3-1/2 month high this week. The Federal Reserve bolstered bets on a third U.S. rate hike of the year on Wednesday, but the focus is now on delayed tax cut plans due  later and Donald Trump’s expected nomination of Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen to lead the central bank. Powell is a current policymaker and is seen by Fed followers as a Yellen-style pragmatist and less likely to jack up interest rates than some of the other candidates rumoured to have been in the running. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, slipped 0.2 percent to 94.533 as it pulled back 0.3 percent against the yen to 113.89 and $1.1655 per euro. Rising interest rates were also in focus in central Europe where the world’s best performing mainstream currency -- the Czech crown -- was awaiting what is expected to be the second hike there in four months. Having had a currency peg removed earlier in the year, the crown is up more than 16 percent against the dollar in 2017 and at a four-year high against the euro. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook quashed concerns recently about muted demand for the iPhone X, which is due for release on Friday, saying pre-orders for the 10th anniversary smartphone were “off the charts”, but analysts will watching closely. Expectations that many users are on the verge of upgrading from older iPhones have also sent Apple’s stock to record highs, pushing it closer to becoming the first publicly listed company with a stock market value above $1 trillion. “Apple is taking the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X, pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote in a note to clients. Commodities appear to be back in boom mode although crude oil futures which have roared higher over the last month dipped for a second day, with Brent crude down 10 cents at $60.56 per barrel and U.S. crude down 1 cent at $54.29. Metals traders were also locking in profits, having seen the likes of copper and nickel surge to a two-year high and aluminium to a more than five-year high this week. "

Apple’s shares fell 0.83 percent in premarket trading after the highly-anticipated iPhone X was launched with a pricey $999 tag and a Nov. 3 shipping date that raised questions about supply constraints ahead of the holiday season. The stock ended lower after a volatile session on Tuesday. But, the drag by Apple was more than offset by a rise in bank stock, helping the three major Wall Street indexes close at record highs. Wall Street has been eking out record highs for most of this year, recovering from periodic setbacks caused by turmoil in Washington, questions over U.S. interest rate hikes and doubts about the Trump administration to push through its pro-business reforms, and lately, tensions over North Korea. “The slight weakness we’re seeing this morning is after a two-day rally. The fundamentals and technicals, however remain strong,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “There are concerns over the bull run, which is on several hope factors. But the list of worries is still there, geopolitical problems are far from solved and perhaps maybe tax reform not happening until 2018 - that would dampen the prospect of a stronger stock market.” North Korea continued to keep the market on edge, after vowing to redouble efforts to fight off what it said was the threat of a U.S. invasion.

The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed U.S. job growth rebounded in October after hurricane-related disruptions hurt employment in September. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 261,000 jobs last month, according to the report. That was the largest gain since July 2016, but was below economists’ expectations for an increase of 310,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent and average hourly earnings were largely unchanged. However, the data hinted at slowing labor market momentum as annual wage gains sharply retreated. However, the data did little to move the case for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve in December. “The headline is all noise, you are starting to adjust for the hurricanes and it’s really hard to know exactly what’s going to happen,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. “I thought the number overall was good.” At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 38 points, or 0.16 percent, with 19,723 contracts changing hands.

Apple surged 3.68 percent to $174.3 in premarket trading after reporting upbeat results and strong initial demand for the new iPhone X. At current levels, Apple was on pace to become the first company to breach $900 billion in market capitalization. With more than three-fourths of the S&P 500 companies having reported, 72.7 percent have topped profit estimates, led by technology companies. President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, in a largely anticipated move, signaling a continuation of current chair Janet Yellen’s monetary policies. In Washington, House Republicans also disclosed their long-delayed plans for tax cuts on Thursday. However, the market reacted with skepticism, as many investors believe it is just a starting point with significant negotiations likely ahead. AIG fell 3.62 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves.

"2017-05-02",-5,"* Apple hits record ahead of quarterly results * Pfizer down after revenue misses estimates * Fed kicks off two-day meeting; statement due Wednesday * Dow up 0.10 pct, S&P flat, Nasdaq down 0.01 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks treaded water in a tight range in late morning trading on Tuesday as a rise in technology stocks, led by Apple, was offset by losses in consumer staples and healthcare companies. The Nasdaq Composite eked out another record high, before easing, with investors holding off from making big bets as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicked off. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but investors are awaiting the central bank’s statement on Wednesday for hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. Weighing on sentiment was U.S. automakers reporting a fall in new vehicle sales for April. Ford dropped 3.8 percent, while General Motors fell 3.3 percent. “I think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “I think people are reading too much into that. There’s a fear that is building on last quarter’s GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don’t think is the case.” Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up. “With earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward.” Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 11:02 a.m. EDT (1502 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.62 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,935.08. The S&P 500 was down 0.18 points, or 0.00 percent, at 2,388.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.78 points, or 0.01 percent, at 6,090.82. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the consumer staples index’s 0.48 percent fall leading the decliners. CVS Health was down 2.8 percent at $79.80, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 1.9 percent to $42.08, after reporting results. Dow component Pfizer was down 1.5 percent at $33.29 after the drugmaker’s quarterly revenue missed estimates, pulling down the healthcare index, which fell 0.3 percent. The technology sector was up 0.33 percent. Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 17.3 percent to $11.26 after the chipmaker’s second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. Coach rose as much as 11 percent to a nine-month high of $43 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,371 to 1,369. On the Nasdaq, 1,576 issues fell and 1,063 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 37 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 111 new highs and 32 new lows. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D‘Souza)"
"2017-11-16",0,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Businesses striving to stamp out slavery from their supply chains should not dismiss struggling suppliers but train them to improve the lives of workers, and technology can play a part, leading companies including Apple and Walmart said on Wednesday. In recent years modern-day slavery has increasingly come under the global spotlight, putting ever greater regulatory and consumer pressure on firms to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor, child labor and other forms of slavery. From cosmetics and clothes to shrimp and smartphones, supply chains are often complex with multiple layers across various countries - whether in sourcing the raw materials or creating the final product - making it hard to identify exploitation. As companies delve deeper into their supply chains to examine workers’ conditions, they should not punish suppliers who violate human rights but help them raise standards and work more efficiently, said Paula Pyers of U.S. tech giant Apple. “We are loathe to terminate a business relationship in cases of violations,” Pyers, Apple’s head of supplier responsibility, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s annual Trust Conference, which focuses on slavery and women’s empowerment. “We want to teach and train suppliers to make them better,” said Pyers, adding that Apple has helped more than 11.5 million workers to learn their rights, and returned at least $28 million to 35,000 employees forced to pay fees to obtain their jobs. With consumers increasingly conscious of slave labor and willing to pay more for ethically sourced goods, big brands should lead by example to inspire their suppliers to get into line, and also to boost profits, said Jan Saumweber of Walmart. “Responsible sourcing is key towards our goal of being the most trusted retailer,” said Saumweber, senior vice president of responsible sourcing at Walmart, the world’s largest retailer. She said Walmart has turned to technology to improve workers’ rights worldwide - from hotlines to a smartphone app in the style of TripAdvisor that allows Burmese migrants working in Thailand’s fishing industry to review their employers. Speaking on a panel about best business practices to tackle modern slavery, several experts said cleaning up supply chains would only be sustainable if this resulted in greater profits. “Investors can direct trillions of dollars to companies with strong human rights policies and clean supply chains,” said Jean Baderschneider, head of Global Fund to End Slavery, a public-private partnership seeking $1.5 billion to combat the crime. “But it can’t be a case of charity or philanthropy – they need to see better returns through having clean supply chains.”  But firms’ efforts to tackle slavery, from codes of conducts to audits, are often lip service and deflect attention from a need for tougher measures, said Bobby Banerjee, professor of management at the University of London’s Cass Business School. “The problem with CSR (corporate social responsibility) is that there is too much C, and not enough S or R,” he said.  “Forced labor is not an aberration, but a viable management practice ... an outcome of the economic system we live in.” "

"2017-11-02",-6,"* Sterling slides, FTSE gains as BoE hike dampens bets on more * Dollar, Wall Street struggle ahead of new Fed chair, U.S. tax bill * Bitcoin shoots above $7,000 then tumbles * Czech crown nurses position as top 2017 currency * Oil and copper edge back after Wednesday jumps * Nikkei probes 21-year highs ahead of Japan holiday * World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Sterling skidded on Thursday after the Bank of England indicated there would be no quick follow up to its first rate rise in a decade, while equity markets awaited news of the next Fed chief and results from Apple. Sterling tumbled around 1 percent and Britain’s main FTSE 100 stock index jumped as, after weeks of heavy hinting, the BoE raised rates by a quarter point but said it sees only gentle rises ahead. The move came as economic growth in Europe’s second largest economy appears weaker than before any increase in borrowing costs in the past 20 years. The pound’s drop took it back below $1.31 and sent it down as much as 1.4 percent to 89 pence per euro, putting it on track for its biggest one-day fall in 3-1/2 months. “All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate will be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,” the BoE said in its post-meeting statement, repeating its previous signals on what is likely to happen to borrowing costs. Though the FTSE made gains on the pound’s drop, stocks in the rest of Europe edged down after hitting two-year highs on Wednesday and Wall Street also struggled on opening, albeit near record highs. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones both went sideways, but the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent as delays to one of its new models sent electric car maker Tesla into reverse ahead of Apple’s results, due after the market close. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook quashed concerns recently about muted demand for the iPhone X, which is due for release on Friday, saying pre-orders for the 10th anniversary smartphone were “off the charts”, but analysts will be watching closely. Expectations that many users are on the verge of upgrading from older iPhones have also sent Apple’s stock to record highs, pushing it closer to becoming the first publicly listed company with a stock market value above $1 trillion. “Apple is taking the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X, pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote in a note to clients. The BoE’s cautious-sounding signals meanwhile nudged government bond yields lower, with investors again weighing up how much momentum there is in the region’s move away from a decade of record low interest rates. “Today’s quarter-point rate hike shouldn’t raise eyebrows, and looks for now to be a one-off ‘muscle flex’ by the BoE, rather than the start of an aggressive tightening,” said Neil Williams, group chief economist at Hermes Investment Management. The Federal Reserve bolstered bets on a third U.S. rate hike of the year on Wednesday, but the focus is now on delayed tax cut plans due later and Donald Trump’s expected nomination of Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen to lead the central bank. Powell is a current policymaker and is seen by Fed followers as a Yellen-style pragmatist and less likely to sharply raise interest rates than some of the other candidates rumoured to have been in the running. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, slipped 0.15 percent to 94.690 as it pulled back 0.1 percent against the yen to 114.12 and $1.1655 per euro. Rising interest rates were also in focus in central Europe where the world’s best performing mainstream currency -- the Czech crown -- got a lift from the second 25 basis point rate rise there in four months. With the currency peg removed earlier in the year, the crown is now up more than 16 percent against the dollar in 2017 and is trading at a four-year high against the euro. Digital currency bitcoin rocketed above $7,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, after a more than sevenfold increase in its value since the start of the year. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value in the past seven weeks alone and hit $7,066.44 at one point on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday. The latest rally was driven by news this week that the world’s largest derivatives exchange operator CME Group is to launch bitcoin futures. Commodities appear to be back in boom mode although crude oil futures, which have surged over the last month, dipped for a second day. Brent crude was down 10 cents at $60.56 per barrel and U.S. crude was down 1 cent at $54.29. Metals traders were also locking in profits, having seen the likes of copper and nickel surge to a two-year high and aluminium to a more than five-year high this week. Part of the rally has been built on hopes that new electric cars will ramp up demand for certain kinds of metals. “It’s going to be a long time before electric vehicles have a material impact on overall demand,” Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain said. “It is good news for nickel that it’s got a longer-term future, but in short, it’s a bit overdone.” "
"2017-04-14",-6,"The idea would be to allay Japanese government concerns about any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a potential risk to national security, the broadcaster said. Apple was not immediately available to comment. Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesman said he could not comment on specific transactions. Foxconn, which participated in the first round of the chip sale auction, has been considered a national security risk due to its ties with China. The bulk of Apple’s iPhones are made at Foxconn’s extensive manufacturing base there. NHK said Apple wants Foxconn to own a stake of around 30 percent of Toshiba’s chip business. An investment by Apple would be its first direct stake in a major global memory chipmaker, as it seeks to secure a stable supply of key components. Samsung Electronics  is the biggest maker of flash memory chips, followed by Toshiba, SK Hynix and U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc. The NHK report comes as Western Digital Corp, Toshiba’s partner and one of the bidders for its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm’s plans to sell its chip unit violates a joint venture contract. Western Digital wants to be given exclusive negotiating rights. The auction of Toshiba’s prized chips asset is essential to the company’s plans to cover multi-billion dollar writedowns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Those costs have plunged the Japanese conglomerate into crisis, prompting it even to warn that it may not be able to continue as a going concern.  Toshiba has narrowed the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors, sources have said: U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP; SK Hynix; Western Digital; and Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics maker. Shares in Toshiba fell more than 5 percent on Friday, hit by a Bloomberg report that the chip business sale had been temporarily put on hold to address the concerns raised by Western Digital. “It is not true Toshiba has put the chip sale process on hold,” a spokesman said. Access to fresh funds would help tide Toshiba over before it can complete the sale of the chips business. Some small lenders have baulked at the idea as they have been offered other Toshiba assets as collateral, such as group companies’ shares and real estate, but Toshiba’s main lenders expect all creditors to approve the move, the people said. In exchange for the chip unit stake as collateral, Toshiba hopes to get about 300 billion yen in fresh loans and be able to draw down existing loan commitments worth 680 billion yen. An executive at one of the main creditor banks said it was still uncertain if Western Digital would agree to Toshiba offering its chip unit stake as collateral. “We would be running risks of being sued by our shareholders if we provide loans to Toshiba without collateral,” the executive said.

"2016-11-29",-9,"Losing the case would be a setback to the banks’ hopes of  bypassing Apple’s in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. Under Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (BEN.AX) also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. A successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic.  Apple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers’ privacy and data security. The company’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. In their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple’s favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees.  Sims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks’ complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple’s contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case. A representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) is the only one of Australia’s “Big Four” banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers.

"2017-06-05",-5,"Banks are expected to perform better in a steepening-yield curve environment, in which bonds with longer maturities need higher rates to attract investors. Monday’s data showed services sector activity slowed in May as new orders tumbled. Together with an April fall in orders for manufactured goods and worker productivity unchanged in the first quarter, data suggest limited scope for faster economic growth.  Despite the softening economic numbers, traders still bet the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its June 13-14 meeting. Reuters data points to a 93.6-percent chance of a quarter-point hike. With the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield near its lowest in seven months, traders are looking for an upward spike and looking at which sectors could benefit from higher rates, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. “With people starting to bottom-fish the 10-year (yield), you bet on financials,” he said. Utilities .SPLRCU, expected to underperform as yields rise, fell 0.48 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 22.25 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,184.04, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.97 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,436.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 10.11 points, or 0.16 percent, to 6,295.68.

Traders are keeping an eye on other political developments coming up including a British election, testimony from former FBI director James Comey regarding the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia, and the French legislative vote. UK opinion polls in the past week have put Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives ahead, though with a narrowing lead over the Labour opposition. Apple (AAPL.O) shares fell 1.0 percent to $153.93 as the iPhone maker unveiled products and services in its annual developers conference.

The weakening of Irma, the second major natural disaster to hit the United States after Hurricane Harvey, allayed concerns about the severity of its financial impact. “Investors have gained confidence that the worst is over and concerns over Irma’s economic impact seem to have disappeared for the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. All eyes will be on Apple as it prepares to unveil the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, whose sales will also have repercussions on its many suppliers and rivals. Apple shares were up 0.82 percent ahead of the event, scheduled to start at 1:00 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). At 8:30 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 56 points, or 0.25 percent, with 10,890 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.16 percent, with 157,376 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.25 points, or 0.24 percent, on volume of 15,465 contracts. The market also seemed to shrug off North Korea’s threat that the United States would soon face the “greatest pain” it had ever experienced in the wake of the U.N. stepping up sanctions against Pyongyang on Monday due to its nuclear tests. North Korea on Tuesday rejected the U.N. Security Council resolution, which imposed a ban on the country’s textile exports and capped crude oil imports. “Although North Korea is a threat and can make the market nervous because of uncertainty, more and more global powers are coming on board, taking the pressure off of just the U.S. dealing with it. About that, the investors feel good,” Bakhos said. All three major Wall Street indexes closed up more than 1 percent on Monday, with the S&P 500 ending at a record high, as concerns over Irma faded and North Korea did not, as some had feared, test-fire missiles over the weekend during its founders day celebrations. Sage Therapeutics slumped more than 25 percent in premarket trading after its drug to treat a life-threatening seizure disorder failed in a late-stage trial. Bunge fell about 5 percent after the agricultural commodities trader said it would buy a 70 percent stake in IOI Loders Croklaan for $946 million. Teva rose 7.24 percent after the drugmaker agreed to sell its contraceptive brand, Paragard, for $1.1 billion to a unit of Cooper Cos, whose stock was flat. In economic data, the Labor Department is expected to release its monthly job openings and labor turnover survey report for July at 10:00 a.m. ET. Job openings rose to 6.163 million in June.

"2017-09-13",-3,"* Target rises on plans to boost holiday season hiring * Nordstrom gains as founding family picks buyout partner * Dow up 0.04 pct, S&P off 0.03 pct, Nasdaq down 0.05 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Sruthi Shankar Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday as Apple-led losses in tech stocks were offset by gains in consumer discretionary and energy stocks, which helped the S&P 500 inch up to a record intra-day high. Apple dropped 1.2 percent on concerns about the newly launched iPhone X’s hefty price tag and its later-than-expected availability date of Nov. 3. The stock was the top drag on all the three major indexes. Indexes were also supported by President Donald Trump’s efforts to push ahead with his plan to cut tax rates. House Speaker Paul Ryan said an outline will be unveiled during the work week beginning Sept. 25. Wall Street is coming off a two-day rally that resulted in the three major indexes finishing at all-time highs on Tuesday and the S&P touching a record intra-day high. “The market’s slowed the treadmill to a slight pace from the run it was on,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. “The likely driver today is going to be a little bit of a late-day rally. But not very large.” The indexes have stayed near record levels this year despite periodic setbacks caused by turmoil in the White House, the timing of U.S. interest rate hikes, doubts about Trump’s ability to push through his pro-business reforms, and lately, tensions over North Korea. At 12:36 p.m. ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.91 points, or 0.04 percent, at 22,126.77 and the S&P 500 was down 0.82 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,495.66. The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, at 6,451.17. A rise in oil prices after the International Energy Agency said a global surplus of crude was starting to shrink sent the S&P energy index up 0.9 percent. Target rose 2.3 percent after the retailer said it would hire 100,000 workers for the holiday season, 43 percent more than last year. McDonald’s gave the biggest boost to the Dow with a 0.9 percent rise, while Amazon’s 0.7 percent rise led the Nasdaq higher.

"2017-09-21",-2,"* Odds of a Dec rate hike jump to 70 pct from 50 pct * Fall in inflation this year remains a mystery - Yellen * Calgon Carbon soars on $1.1 bln Kuraray buyout deal * Indexes down: Dow 0.04 pct, S&P 0.18 pct, Nasdaq 0.67 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from their all-time highs on Thursday, weighed down by Apple and the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve, which hinted at raising interest rates for a third time this year despite low inflation. Shares of Apple fell 1.7 percent and was on track to post its biggest two-day decline since June. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major indexes. Investors were also absorbing the Fed’s decision to start ending monetary stimulus by reducing its approximately $4.2 trillion in holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities - acquired in the years after the 2008 financial crisis - from October. While the central bank left rates unchanged, it cited low unemployment, growth in business investment and an economic expansion that has been moderate but durable this year to build its case for another rate hike in 2017. Interest rate futures are now pricing in about a 70 percent chance of a December hike, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, up from above 50 percent prior to the Fed meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the fall in inflation this year remained a mystery, adding that the central bank was ready to change the interest rate outlook if needed. “Today’s movement is most likely a give back as people digest the Fed statement and press conference,” said Michael Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “Clearly the Fed doesn’t have answers on the 2017 low inflation weakness but they’re still very sensitive to falling behind the curve so they want to stay in front of the inflation curve.” At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.04 points, or 0.04 percent, at 22,403.55, the S&P was down 4.57 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,503.67. The Nasdaq Composite was down 34.31 points, or 0.53 percent, at 6,421.74. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the technology index’s 0.76 percent fall leading the decliners. Nvidia pared losses to trade down 3.1 percent after GlobalFoundries, which fabricates chips for Advanced Micro Devices, said Tesla had not committed to working with the company to develop its own artificial intelligence chip for self-driving cars. Advanced Micro pared gains to trade up 0.3 percent, while Tesla was off 0.8 percent. U.S. stocks have continued to climb this year, with the S&P up about 12 percent so far, helped by strong corporate profits and optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump will cut taxes for businesses. Valuations are stretched with the S&P trading near 17.6 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14.3, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Shares of Calgon Carbon soared 61.9 percent after Japanese chemical manufacturer Kuraray agreed to buy the carbon materials firm for $1.107 billion.

However, a 3 percent surge in Apple’s shares provided support after the company’s blowout quarterly results and reports of strong initial demand for its new iPhone X. Apple’s gains helped Dow open at a record level. The stock opened at $174, briefly breaching the $900 billion market capitalization mark. The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs last month but was below economists’ expectations for a rise of 310,000. “Employment growth is indeed slowing ... This is basically healthy but certainly we’re moving toward the end of the cycle,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial. Unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that was because 765,000 people dropped out of the labor force. Average hourly earnings slipped by one cent, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms. That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent, the smallest since February 2016. “(Wage growth) is worrying. There’s not a lot of good news there. Lower paid workers going back to work after the hurricane would drag it down but you’d expect to see some small wage growth, not flat,” said McMillan. The data, however, did little to move the case for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve in December. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.2 points, or 0.02 percent, at 23,512.06, the S&P 500 was down 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,578.38. The Nasdaq Composite was up 6.15 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,721.09. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by losses in financial index. It has been a busy week for market, with President Donald Trump on Thursday tapping Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank and House Republicans disclosing their long-delayed plans for tax cuts. AIG fell 4.69 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,480 to 1,079.

"2017-05-03",-10,"* Apple iPhone sales dip spurs consumer health worry * Fed statement eyed for signal of June rate hike (Updates with European market close) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - World stock markets fell on Wednesday as declines in iPhone  sales brought about some concern about consumer health, while the dollar edged higher before a U.S. central bank statement that may signal a rate hike next month. Apple Inc was down 0.3 percent, paring earlier declines, after it reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales in its fiscal second quarter on Tuesday. The drop came on the heels of a decline in sales for U.S. automakers for April and a soft first-quarter reading on U.S. growth last week. Even with the decline in iPhone sales, Apple still managed to top earnings estimates in what has been a strong quarter for U.S. companies. Thomson Reuters data shows first-quarter growth is currently expected to be 14.2 percent, the best quarter since 2011, with 357 of S&P 500 companies having reported. “Despite some isolated incidents, overall the season has been great,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “And that’s one of the reasons why the indexes are hovering near record levels.” A report by payrolls processor ADP said private employers expanded their payrolls by 177,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since the 62,000 increase last October as they faced increasing difficulty finding qualified workers. Other data indicated the pace of growth in the U.S. economy’s service sector increased in April, led by a jump in new orders, according to an industry report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16.43 points, or 0.08 percent, to 20,933.46, the S&P 500 lost 6 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,385.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 28.98 points, or 0.48 percent, to 6,066.39. Europe’s STOXX 600 index lost 0.04 percent to retreat from a 20-month high and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.23 percent. The U.S. economic data helped push the dollar higher ahead of the Federal Reserve statement. While the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged later on Wednesday, investors will look for signs it may hike them in June. Traders are currently pricing in a 70.7-percent chance of a hike of at least a quarter-point next month, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. The dollar index rose 0.12 percent, with the euro down 0.12 percent to $1.0914. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.2982 percent, from 2.296 percent late on Tuesday. The U.S. Treasury said it is studying the possibility of issuing ultra long-term bonds. Oil prices retreated from earlier highs after U.S. government data showed a smaller-than-expected decline in domestic crude inventories and weak demand for gasoline, feeding concerns about a supply glut. U.S. crude fell 0.06 percent to $47.63 per barrel and Brent was last at $50.59, up 0.26 percent on the day. "
"2017-05-01",-8,"* Light trading as Europe, other markets close for May Day * Report says Trump mulls breaking up banks; sector stocks wobbly * U.S. manufacturing slows, consumer spending flat By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - Apple shares hit a record high on Monday, lifting U.S. stocks and a gauge of key world equity indexes, while data on U.S. drilling and output kept downward pressure on oil prices. Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. “While we’re starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong.” Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 20,950.63, the S&P 500 gained 7.62 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,391.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,096.05. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.25 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.16 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.31 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.59 percent. Stocks briefly pared gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg he is actively considering breaking up the largest U.S. banks. Oil slipped more than 1 percent as rising output in Libya and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts. “With four months of the cutting in effect we haven’t seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “It’s not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016.” U.S. crude fell 1.28 percent to $48.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $51.39, down 1.27 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index rose 0.03 percent, with the euro up 0.08 percent to $1.0904. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback to 111.86 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2908, down 0.29 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.327 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. Spot gold dropped 1.0 percent to $1,255.18 an ounce.

"2017-07-26",-7,"The liquid crystal display manufacturer has tapped Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, the source said, adding that the creditors were willing to extend the loan if it was guaranteed by INCJ. The source declined to be identified as talks on the matter were private. Officials at Mizuho, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and INCJ declined to comment while a representative for SMBC was not immediately available for comment. The request was first reported by the Nikkei business daily. It said INCJ would provide the guarantees and that further restructuring may involve halting production at its smartphone panel plants in the central Japanese city of Nomi and China’s Jiangsu Province as well as cutting several hundred jobs through an early retirement offer. Japan Display said in a statement it was looking at implementing drastic steps to reshape itself amid shifting market conditions. “We will make an announcement when we reach a decision,” it said. INCJ helped form Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp five years ago, but government intervention has so far failed to result in putting the firm on a solid business. Apple is widely tipped to adopt OLED displays, which are thinner and more flexible than LCD screens, for its iPhone 8 expected in the second half of 2017, and Japan Display’s lack of a presence in that segment of the market has put it at a major disadvantage. INCJ’s role in rescuing Japan’s struggling tech industry could intensify as it is expected to play a major role in groups that are the front-runners for Toshiba’s sale of its $18 billion chip business. Japan Display’s shares were flat at the end of the morning session, in line with the broader market. "
"2017-10-11",-15,"A group of 76 companies submitted a brief to the court saying a split among lower courts on that question had created uncertainty for employers and gay workers. The companies asked the Supreme Court to take up the case of Jameka Evans, a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who says she was harassed and forced to quit her job because she is gay. The companies said the lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in the 27 states that have not adopted their own such laws. And “the uncertainty and vulnerability LGBT workers face results in diminished employee health, productivity, job engagement, and satisfaction,” wrote the companies’ lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. A federal appeals court in Atlanta in March dismissed Evans’ case, saying her claims were foreclosed by prior decisions that said discrimination against gay employees is not a form of unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will likely decide by the end of the year whether it will take Evans’ case. In April, a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule in favor of a gay worker under Title VII. And in June, about 50 of the same companies involved in Wednesday’s brief asked an appeals court in Manhattan to do the same. In that case, the U.S. Department of Justice urged the court to rule that Title VII does not protect gay employees. That was a reversal of the Justice Department’s stance under the Obama administration. Gay rights is the latest issue to cause a rift between the business community and the Trump administration. Some companies and executives in August resigned from White House business councils and repudiated President Donald Trump’s comments about a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And business groups have clashed with the president over issues including immigration, and, this week, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to LGBT workers, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law.

"2016-11-28",-6,"SYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Three of Australia’s four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc  in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple’s Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank’s ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm. “While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,” commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The decision is a setback for the banks’ hopes to bypass Apple’s in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. It also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple’s dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. Apple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers’ privacy and data security. A representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. The ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Australia’s third biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple. "

Shares of Apple dropped 1.2 percent to $145.75 in premarket trading, a day after the company also forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates. “The market is taking its cue from Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Akamai Technologies tumbled 13.6 percent after it gave a weak forecast for current-quarter revenue and profit. Gilead dropped 2 percent after the drugmaker reported a lower-than-expected profit. Strong corporate reports so far had resulted in estimates for first-quarter profit growth at S&P 500 companies increasing to 13.9 percent as of Tuesday, from an estimate of 10.4 percent growth two weeks back, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The strong earnings have also helped offset some fears about geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula, the lack of progress by the Trump administration in enacting its economic agenda as well as mixed economic data. “Strong earnings are still driving the market. Not only are earnings good, the CEOs are painting a picture of continued earnings growth and this helps trump some of the other factors,” said Kinahan.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 14 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 19,483 contracts. Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. Since then, automakers have reported a drop in vehicle dales for March, which along with the drop in iPhone sales, have added to nerves. The Federal Reserve could address GDP when it issues a statement at 2 p.m. ET, at the end of its two-day meeting on interest rates. While the central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady, it may hint it is on track for an increase in June.

The Fed begins its meeting later in the day and while the central bank is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, investors are awaiting its statement, due on Wednesday, for clues regarding the future path of rate hikes. “While no one expects any changes to policy, the 500-word statement will probably provide some direction to the dollar,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “‘Will the Fed acknowledge a slowdown in growth and thus send rate hike expectations lower for 2017?’ The Fed’s statement should be answering these questions, and based on that, traders will act.” Strong corporate earnings for the first quarter have largely outweighed concerns about patches of weak economic data, including a report last week that showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. Dow e-minis were down 16 points, or 0.08 percent, with 13,314 contracts changing hands at 8:17 a.m. ET (1217 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 1 point, or 0.04 percent, with 79,398 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.75 points, or 0.08 percent, on volume of 18,336 contracts. Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by gains in marquee tech stocks, including Apple, that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high.

The recent rally on Wall Street has been supported by strong third-quarter results from technology and consumer companies amid concerns over stretched valuations. “Earnings drive the markets, and they continue to be really good,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Third-quarter earnings have been largely positive, with 73 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.

U.S. stocks edged lower after the release of the Republican tax plan, which called for a swath of changes to the U.S. tax code, including slashing the corporate tax rate and reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals. “Basically, it is not revenue neutral on the face of it and it would require some awfully optimistic assumptions in terms of dynamic scoring, meaning growth will be so huge the tax cut will pay for itself,” said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc in New York. “Getting it through Congress could be challenging.” Apple, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, will report results after the market closes.

Housing shares stumbled 0.95 percent on the tax plan, which would maintain the deductions for mortgage interest on existing loans and newly purchased homes for up to $500,000. The dollar fell to its lowest in a week against a basket of major currencies after the tax details were released. The dollar index fell 0.24 percent, with the euro up 0.47 percent to $1.1672. Sterling skidded after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years but said it expected only “very gradual” further increases over the next three years. Sterling dropped 1.1 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day drop since June, and Britain’s main FTSE 100 stock index climbed 0.7 percent. The rest of Europe retreated from two-year highs hit in the prior session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.45 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.05 percent. Attention will stay on the Fed after it held rates steady on Wednesday and cemented expectations for a third U.S. rate hike of the year in December, with Donald Trump’s expected nomination of Jerome Powell on Thursday to replace Janet Yellen at the Fed’s helm. Powell is a current policymaker and is seen by Fed followers as a Yellen-style pragmatist and less likely to sharply raise interest rates than some of the other candidates to have been in the running.

Li’s visit comes weeks after Gou and other senior Foxconn executives discussed significant investments in the United States at the White House. When contacted about the U.S. investment, Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (2317.TW), declined to comment. In a statement issued after Li’s visit, the company said it was committed to investing in China.  Analysts have said that Gou treads a fine line in balancing his business empire that straddles both the United States and China.  Foxconn is a major supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O). China is the base for its assembly of Apple’s iconic iPhones, and where Foxconn employs about a million people.  Foxconn is also in the running as a suitor for Toshiba Corp’s (6502.T) chip business. People familiar with the deal have told Reuters that Foxconn is considered a U.S. security risk due to ties with China. Reuters earlier reported that Japanese display maker Sharp Corp (6753.T) may start building a $7 billion plant in the United States in the first half of 2017, taking the lead on a project initially outlined by its Taiwanese parent Foxconn.

"2017-04-19",-7,"The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple’s contract manufacturers underpaid royalties in the second quarter, but revenue was not affected as the amount was similar to what Apple claimed Qualcomm owed it.  San Diego-based Qualcomm also warned that it was unclear whether Apple’s contract manufacturers would underpay royalties owed in the third quarter, leading to the wider-than-usual profit forecast for the period. However, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a post-earnings call that the company expected to continue to be an “important supplier to Apple now and into the future”.  Qualcomm forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of 90 cents-$1.15 per share and revenue of $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    The royalties issue also weighed on Qualcomm’s second-quarter results.  The quarter included a $974 million reduction to revenue, or 48 cents per share, related to an arbitration over a royalties dispute with BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO). Revenue fell 9.6 pct to $5.02 billion in the three months ended March 26. (bit.ly/2ot17st) On an adjusted basis, Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.99 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $5.89 billion. Despite the litigation worries, revenue in the Qualcomm Technology Licensing business rose about 5 percent to $2.25 billion, ahead of the analysts’ estimate of $2.24 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.  The licensing unit contributed about 85 percent of the company’s earnings before taxes in 2016. Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder attributed the results in part to catch-up payments by customers who had earlier disputed them.  “It’s kind of a confusing mess right now on who’s coming and who’s going, that’s one of the reasons that you’re not seeing the stock perform better,” Snyder said. The company also said there was increased demand for its Snapdragon mobile chips, particularly in China, boosting revenue by 10 percent in its chip-making unit. Qualcomm’s market share in China is expected to increase to 65 percent this year from 50 percent in 2016, with share gains in OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and Meizu, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang wrote in a note. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.34 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.19.   "
"2017-02-15",-3,"Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O) and seed company Monsanto Co (MON.N), which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett  said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) are normally Buffett‘s, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years. Berkshire’s initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett’s usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence. The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple’s 10 biggest investors. “I‘m stunned to see the size of that Apple position,” said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple’s 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. It had been widely believed that Berkshire’s initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment. “It’s quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren,” Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was “in large part” his decision to dive back into airlines. “The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset,” Russo said. “More planes are traveling more full.” Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8 billion stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

"2017-05-02",-2,"* Apple hits record ahead of quarterly results * Pfizer down after revenue misses estimates * Fed kicks off two-day meeting; statement due Wednesday * Indexes up: Dow 0.21 pct, S&P up 0.14 pct, Nasdaq 0.11 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were modestly higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite eking out another record high, helped by an Apple-led rise in technology stocks. However, investors held off from making big bets as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicked off. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but investors are awaiting the central bank’s statement on Wednesday for hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The markets’ gains were capped by a decline in auto stocks after automakers reported a fall in new vehicle sales for April. Ford dropped 3.8 percent, while General Motors fell 2.8 percent. “I think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “I think people are reading too much into that. There’s a fear that is building on last quarter’s GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don’t think is the case.” Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up. “With earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward.” Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:41 a.m. ET (1641 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.41 points, or 0.21 percent, at 20,956.87. The S&P 500 was up 3.36 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,391.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.94 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,098.54. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the technology index’s 0.39 percent rise leading the advancers. Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market. A 0.3 percent fall in consumer staples led the laggard. CVS Health was down 2.8 percent at $79.70, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 8.2 percent to $41.98, both after reporting results. Dow component Pfizer was down 1 percent at $33.43 after the drugmaker’s quarterly revenue missed estimates. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 18.9 percent to $11.04 after the chipmaker’s second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. Coach rose as much as 12.2 percent to a nine-month high of $43.47 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,477 to 1,311. On the Nasdaq, 1,542 issues fell and 1,232 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 43 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 129 new highs and 36 new lows. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D‘Souza)"

"2017-10-11",-9,"The companies asked the Supreme Court to take up the case of Jameka Evans, a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who says she was harassed and forced to quit her job because she is gay.  The companies said the lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in the 27 states that have not adopted their own such laws.  And “the uncertainty and vulnerability LGBT workers face results in diminished employee health, productivity, job engagement, and satisfaction,” wrote the companies’ lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The Supreme Court will likely decide by the end of the year whether it will take Evans’ case.  In April, a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule in favor of a gay worker under Title VII. And in June, about 50 of the same companies involved in Wednesday’s brief asked an appeals court in Manhattan to do the same. In that case, the U.S. Department of Justice urged the court to rule that Title VII does not protect gay employees. That was a reversal of the Justice Department’s stance under the Obama administration. Gay rights is the latest issue to cause a rift between the business community and the Trump administration. Some companies and executives in August resigned from White House business councils and repudiated President Donald Trump’s comments about a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And business groups have clashed with the president over issues including immigration, and, this week, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trump administration says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to LGBT workers, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. "

"2016-10-27",-2,"“Hello again,” reads the invitation from Apple to the Thursday product launch, likely a reference to the original Macintosh that debuted with “hello” scrolled across its black and white screen. Technology websites, including Techradar, expect the new MacBook Pro to remain the workhouse of the notebook computer line while getting updates like a fingerprint reader and high-speed USB ports. Like the iPhone 7, it will drop a standard headphone jack. Apple reported its third straight quarter of declining iPhone sales earlier this week, although it also sees a record holiday quarter by sales, thanks to the new iPhone 7. The Mac line accounted for about 11 percent of Apple sales in the just-finished fiscal year, with the number of machines sold down by 10 percent to 18.5 million. Apple said that was in line with an overall market decline, but analysts and investors said Apple needs to start growing again. “What they really need to do is get people buying Macs again, instead of upgrading old ones. They haven’t had a new, powerful MacBook Pro in a while and the MacBook Air is getting old,” said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. He said the fingerprint reader could help sell more Macs. “Touch ID for Apple Pay could be interesting,” he said. Macs still outsell iPads in dollar terms, and old rival Microsoft Corp on Wednesday debuted its first desktop computer in a bid to re-energize the sector with software that allows 3D editing. HP Inc meanwhile has claimed that it has the thinnest notebook computer, a prize Apple held for some time. Bob O‘Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research LLC, said the Mac announcement comes during a time when the market believes focus on the iPhone means Apple has “almost given up on Macs,” which has lead to lose market share to personal computers. “It’ll be good to have Apple keep themselves relevant” with new Macs, he said. “Though many had written the category off, it’s fascinating to see both Microsoft and Apple make big PC-related announcements this week. It clearly shows the relevance that computers still have.” "

A partnership struck with IBM in 2014 signaled Apple’s intentions of getting more serious about corporate clients, or enterprise, and deals with Cisco and SAP have followed.

"2017-02-14",2,"* Dollar, Treasury yields, bank stocks gain * Bond proxy sectors, utilities and real estate, drop * Apple hits record high; top stock on S&P, Nasdaq * Indexes up: Dow 0.32 pct, S&P 0.30 pct, Nasdaq 0.26 pct   (Updates to afternoon) By Noel Randewich Feb 14 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs on Tuesday, led by bank stocks after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said it would be unwise to wait too long to raise interest rates. Apple rose as much as 1.25 percent to an all-time high of $134.95, contributing to gains in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes. Yellen said delaying rate hikes could force the U.S. central bank to raise rates quicker down the line, which could risk a recession. She also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Banks, expected to gain from higher interest rates, led the market higher. Goldman Sachs rose 1.49 percent and Bank of America added 2.97 percent. The S&P 500 financial index rose 1.3 percent. President Donald Trump’s pro-business stance sparked a record-setting rally in stocks following his November election. However, he has given scant detail on his policies, leaving the Fed with limited visibility about the economy’s future direction. Speaking to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Yellen did not indicate whether the Fed still planned to raise rates three times this year, nor did she indicate whether a hike might come in March or in June, as most analysts expect. “With the new president, there is still the uncertainty of the economic policy,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “How much growth we get out of the market will affect policymaking and how quickly they need to react.” At 2:04 p.m. (1904 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 0.32 percent at 20,477.2, while the S&P 500  had gained 0.30 percent to 2,335.32, both reversing losses from earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.26 percent to 5,778.93. Yellen’s comments lifted the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the utilities and real estate sectors, which tend to fall when Treasury yields rise. General Motors added 4.64 percent after Peugeot owner PSA Group said it is in talks to buy GM’s European Opel business. The prospects of sector consolidation caused Fiat to jump  4.84 percent, while Ford gained 0.84 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 16 new lows.

"2016-10-26",3,"But a slight miss on fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and a projection of gross profit margins a touch behind analyst targets reflected broader concerns that Apple may have lost its tech superiority, even with the refreshed iPhone 7. “In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple’s products are still seen favorably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was,” Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note. Apple shares fell 2.8 percent to $114.99 in after-hours trading. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in a phone interview with Reuters it was “impossible to know” if there was any effect yet from rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd halting production of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 phones earlier this month. He also said that Apple was “supply constrained” and selling all the smartphones it could make. “It’s clear that Apple is bullish about growth in the iPhone, but there’s little evidence of that growth in the actual results announced today,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  “Given that the iPhone 7 and especially the iPhone 7 Plus is in short supply, Apple is going to be a little constrained in its ability to take full advantage of the strong demand we’re seeing,” he added.  If it hits that estimate, this quarter would be Apple’s biggest on record by sales, ahead of the $75.9 billion revenue it posted in the year-ago period.    However, Apple offered a conservative outlook on profit margins, 38 to 38.5 percent, versus expectations of nearly 39 percent, said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. “I think people were a bit surprised,” said Montagne, whose firm holds Apple shares. Maestri said high demand for Apple’s newest iPhones made the company confident about results in the first quarter. The company’s net income fell to $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share in the quarter from $11.12 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year earlier. That beat the average estimate of $1.66 per share. Apple’s fortunes are strongly tied to the success of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue. Chief Executive Tim Cook also said on a call with analysts that India was poised to boom in smartphone sales as a more powerful 4G cellular network was put in place this year and next.  He also hinted at potential future areas of business, commenting that media content creation and ownership was a great opportunity. Cook declined to say whether Apple was working on a car, as has been widely reported, but he called the industry “interesting.” "

He also said that Apple was “supply constrained” and selling all the smartphones it could make. “It’s clear that Apple is bullish about growth in the iPhone, but there’s little evidence of that growth in the actual results announced today,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  “Given that the iPhone 7 and especially the iPhone 7 Plus is in short supply, Apple is going to be a little constrained in its ability to take full advantage of the strong demand we’re seeing,” he added.  If it hits that estimate, this quarter would be Apple’s biggest on record by sales, ahead of the $75.9 billion revenue it posted in the year-ago period.    However, Apple offered a conservative outlook on profit margins, 38 to 38.5 percent, versus expectations of nearly 39 percent, said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. “I think people were a bit surprised,” said Montagne, whose firm holds Apple shares. Maestri said high demand for Apple’s newest iPhones made the company confident about results in the first quarter. The company’s net income fell to $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share in the quarter from $11.12 billion, or $1.96 per share, a year earlier. That beat the average estimate of $1.66 per share. Apple’s fortunes are strongly tied to the success of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue. Chief Executive Tim Cook also said on a call with analysts that India was poised to boom in smartphone sales as a more powerful 4G cellular network was put in place this year and next.  He also hinted at potential future areas of business, commenting that media content creation and ownership was a great opportunity. Cook declined to say whether Apple was working on a car, as has been widely reported, but he called the industry “interesting.” "

Apple is still getting to know how consumer interest varies for larger and smaller phones, having launched two competing sizes only in 2014, he said. The company also may have underestimated the number of customers it would win from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which recently recalled its own large format phone, the Galaxy Note 7, after a number of them caught fire. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview it was “impossible to know” the effect of Samsung halting production of the Note 7 earlier this month. “We cannot fulfill all the demand that is out there right now,” he added.  Speeding up production would be difficult, analysts said. The company cannot contract new suppliers, hire more workers and open factories overnight, said Trip Chowdhry, managing director of Global Equities Research. “You can’t just shoot iPhones out of an assembly line at the speed of a bullet,” he said. “Apple does things to perfection.

Apple rose 0.66 percent to an all-time high of $142.40 after the company unveiled a new version of its iPad tablet. The stock was the biggest boost to all the three major indexes. The gains were broad, with all the 11 major S&P sectors higher, led by technology and healthcare stocks . Investor optimism was also boosted by French centrist Emmanuel Macron’s performance in a television debate that boosted a view that he would win the presidential election over the far-right’s Marine Le Pen. The expectations boosted sentiment across Europe, with stock markets across the region broadly firmer. Global investors have been worried about increasing protectionism, following the Brexit vote and President Donald Trump’s election. Last week, the G20 leaders dropped a pledge to keep global trade free and open. Investors will keep an eye on speeches by several Federal  Reserve officials for clues on the path of future interest rate hikes after the central bank last week raised rates for the first time this year. The Fed stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of the three expected by the market. Bank of Kansas City President Esther George and Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester are scheduled to speak later in the day, while Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren will release the text of his speech. “Investors continue to expect two more rate hikes this year, although the odds have slipped slightly since last week,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda in London. “That said, I still expect the Federal Reserve tightening cycle to be much more aggressive than other central banks over the next couple of years.” At 9:39 a.m. ET (1339 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 58.33 points, or 0.28 percent, at 20,964.19, the S&P 500 was up 7.65 points, or 0.32 percent, at 2,381.12. The Nasdaq Composite was up 23.55 points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,925.08. Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, helped by expectations that an OPEC-led output cut would be extended beyond June but gains were pegged back by concerns about persistently high crude inventories. Shares of General Mills slipped 0.2 percent to $60.13 after the Cheerios maker’s quarterly sales missed expectations. Esperion Therapeutics jumped 15.1 percent to $47.48 after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the stock. FedEx and Dow-component Nike, which are due to report quarterly results after markets close, both edged up about 0.6 percent.

Data earlier in the day showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a more than two-year high in January and private employers boosted hiring last month. However, stocks struggled to gain momentum and the S&P 500 avoided its fifth session of consecutive declines by the slightest margin. Dow component Exxon (XOM.N) slipped 1.1 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls (JCI.N) fell 3.4 percent to $42.50 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. On the upside, Facebook (FB.O) shares added almost 2 percent in extended trading following higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. During the regular session, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rallied 16.3 percent to $12.06 in nearly four times its usual daily volume a day after reporting results.

The announcement comes at a time when the iPhone maker has been struggling to reassure its shareholders about its business in China. Chinese consumers are critical to fueling demand for iPhones, and a slump in the country’s stock market and Beijing’s recent devaluation of the yuan have shaken Apple investors already worried about slowing growth in the world’s No. 2 economy. Apple Music in China will feature local artists such as Eason Chan, Li Ronghao, JJ Lin and G.E.M., along with a range of international artists, the company said. Subscribers would also be able to rent or buy movies from a selection of Chinese studios as well as Hollywood blockbusters on the iTunes Store, Apple said. Movies on iTunes will start at 5 yuan for renting in high definition and 18 yuan for buying new releases in high definition, the company said. Paid iBooks will start at 0.5 yuan. "

While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport.

"2016-09-14",1,"Fueled by U.S. wireless carriers’ reports of strong early orders for the iPhone 7 as well as arch-rival Samsung Electronics’ widely-publicized recall of potentially exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, shares of Apple were up 4.6 percent at $112.57 and had gained 7 percent in the past two days. Its market capitalization reached nearly $607 billion, compared to $535 billion for Alphabet and $440 billion for Microsoft. After sinking to a two-year low in July that had portfolio managers describing Apple as a value stock and no longer a growth play, shares of the world’s most valuable listed company have since rebounded 25 percent. On Tuesday, Sprint said pre-orders for the iPhone 7 were up nearly four times compared to last year’s iPhone. T-Mobile said pre-orders rose nearly four times compared with its next most popular iPhone. Potentially adding to demand for Apple’s products, China’s quality watchdog said on Wednesday that Samsung would recall 1,858 of its Galaxy Note 7 phones due to its fire-prone batteries, expanding the list of countries where the devices have been recalled. “With the carriers telling Samsung owners that Samsung wants you to take your phone back into the store, well, people are going to look elsewhere,” said Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison. Specific details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. With U.S. consumers less eager than in the past to replace their devices, global smartphone shipments are likely to grow less than 2 percent in 2016, compared to 10 percent last year, according to market research firm IDC. Revenue for Apple’s fiscal year ending this month is likely to fall 8 percent and then grow 4 percent next year, according to the average estimate of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"2016-10-07",-10,"The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung’s infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Friday’s decision was made by the full slate of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow U.S. Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California, which ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission.  Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday’s decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday’s ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. “But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward - and it’s a big win for Apple.” The case is Apple Inc v.

"2016-09-08",-3,"“As we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7,” Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said. “These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers.” The company reiterated its financial outlook for the quarter.  Apple launched the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus at a San Francisco event on Wednesday. The new phones feature improved cameras and eliminate the traditional headphone jack in favor of new technology. Preorders will begin on Friday, and Apple will start shipping the devices on Sept. 16. The stakes for the iPhone 7 are high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history. As they try to assess whether the iPhone has reached a plateau, investors will not be happy about losing a data point, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners.  Apple shares fell 2.4 percent to $105.71 in mid-day trading. On Sept. 28, 2015, when Apple announced record first-weekend sales of its iPhone 6, its stock dropped 2 percent, reflecting Wall Street’s worries about cooling demand. The iPhone is Apple’s lifeblood, accounting for more than half of the company’s revenue. In the most recent quarter, Apple recorded $42.4 billion in total revenue with $24 billion coming from the iPhone.  Investors have grown accustomed to receiving early sales figures, and Apple’s decision to hold back seems significant, said analyst John Jackson of IDC. “It reinforces, I think, the thesis that this product is mature,” he said. Nevertheless, sales logged when the supply chain is ramping up only reveal so much about the gadget’s ultimate trajectory, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights Strategy.  “What’s meaningful to me are the first month of sales with full supply,” he said.

"2016-10-27",4,"Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, described the changes as “important incremental upgrades” which would convince people with old Macs to trade up to the smaller, faster model.  But he noted that Microsoft Corp’s  competing Surface notebook allowed touch on its main screen. “A lot of people spend a lot of time on these machines. The key for them is incremental innovations that make their job easier,” said Bajarin. “That’s value.”   The new pricing is roughly line with expectations, Bajarin said, but it surprised some. On Twitter, many potential buyers were underwhelmed by the new features and posted pictures of people crying about the new prices. Others tweeted that they hoped for more products. Apple shares fell 1.2 percent. The buttons, which change depending on what programs the user is running, effectively act as a second screen, showing older versions of a picture being edited, for example. Other computer makers have chosen to use touch screens for the main display screen, including Microsoft’s first-ever desktop and a revamped Surface Book laptop, launched on Wednesday. The 15-inch notebook will start at $2,399, compared with $1,999 for the previous version.  The Mac line accounted for about 11 percent of Apple sales in the just-finished fiscal year, with the number of machines sold down by 10 percent to 18.5 million. Apple has steadily upgraded components to the MacBook Pro, but the overall form has changed little, and PC Week described the unit being replaced as a “fossil” which had not had a major design change since 2013. Apple also announced a new TV App that would work on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad products, in an effort to make it easier to tune into programs across devices. The company also said that it would integrate Twitter Inc feeds into live sports games on Apple TV, adding a social element to the product. "

A partnership struck with IBM in 2014 signaled Apple’s intentions of getting more serious about corporate clients, or enterprise, and deals with Cisco and SAP have followed. The deal with Deloitte will ensure that Apple is top of mind as companies think strategically about their practices, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.  “What’s needed now is more of a focus on transforming the enterprise and helping businesses identify which areas have the highest either return on investment or highest impact on customer satisfaction,” Cook said. “Deloitte is well positioned for this.” As part of the EnterpriseNext program, customers can meet with designers and engineers who specialize in Apple’s operating system.  “The intent there is to, in one location, bring the best engineers, the best products and the best thinkers to try and address clients’ problems,” Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global, said in an interview. Apple faces mounting pressure to find new streams of revenue after sales of the iPhone, which drives more than half of its revenue, declined for the first time this year.  The tech giant appears to have concluded that the quickest way to progress in enterprise is to partner with companies rooted in the space, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Cook said in 2015 that Apple’s enterprise business had reached $25 billion in annual revenue. He declined to provide a new figure on Wednesday but stressed the company is gaining ground.  “The momentum is significant, and we see this as a very important growth vector,” he said.  "

VirnetX and Apple have been fighting over patents for years. The case began in 2010 when VirnetX, a Nevada-based patent licensor, filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas federal court, claiming infringement of four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links. A jury in 2012 awarded $368.2 million in damages, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., partly overturned that verdict, saying there were problems with how the trial judge instructed jurors on calculating damages. On remand, VirnetX’s two suits were combined, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million, one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case. However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple. In the latest trial, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding. Apple spokeswoman Rachel Tulley declined to comment. An attorney for VirnetX could not immediately be reached.

IDC analyst Ryan Reith called the new version a “great incremental improvement” and predicted it would outsell the first version, in part because of its appeal to the fitness audience. But he said it faced challenges, such as competing with smartphones for consumer spending. While the focus on fitness helps, Apple still needs a breakthrough app to nudge the smartwatch into the mainstream – and it remains unlikely to find it in Pokemon Go, the popular augmented reality game that is coming to the gadget later this year, Gillis said. “The killer app for the watch remains to be seen,” he said.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates the watch will generate $4.1 billion in revenue for Apple this year, up from $2.7 billion in 2015. IDC analyst Ryan Reith called the new version a “great incremental improvement” and predicted it would outsell the first version, in part because of its appeal to the fitness audience. But he said it faced challenges, such as competing with smartphones for consumer spending. While the focus on fitness helps, Apple still needs a breakthrough app to nudge the smartwatch into the mainstream – and it remains unlikely to find it in Pokemon Go, the popular augmented reality game that is coming to the gadget later this year, Gillis said. “The killer app for the watch remains to be seen,” he said.

"2016-09-07",-3,"Hours ahead of the launch, options prices for Apple showed the expectation was for the stock to move less than 2 percent by Friday, compared with historic moves in the week after a product launch of 3.5 percent in any direction.

For the last seven major launches, the 30-day at-the-money implied volatility for Apple options has averaged about 37 percent within a range of 28 percent to 53 percent, according to Reuters data. At near 19 percent, implied volatility was at its lowest ahead of a new product introduction. That speaks volumes to the expectation, but may also catch the market sleeping.

"2017-01-10",2,"App stores run by Apple and Google generate billions of dollars in revenue globally for them and China is a key target market as its users rely heavily on their phones for daily tasks ranging from grocery shopping to booking nail appointments.

Tencent said it had seen an “encouraging response” from merchants including Didi Chuxing, Dianping.com, Meituan.com, 58.com, JD as well as airlines, travel agencies and hotels.

Apple’s workforce includes a pool of retail employees that Google and Facebook do not have. In Apple stores, blacks and Hispanics respectively comprised 12 percent and 17 percent of general employees, and 5 percent and 10 percent of the leadership. At Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, blacks and Hispanics respectively made up 2 and 3 percent of the overall workforce and 1 and 3 percent of its tech employees, little changed from last year.  At Facebook, blacks and Hispanics were respectively 2 and 4 percent of the workforce and 1 and 3 percent of tech employees.  Apple’s global workforce was 32 percent women, up 1 percent from the end of June 2015. Women held 23 percent of technical positions, up 1 percent from a year ago, and 28 percent of leadership positions, unchanged from June last year.    Reverend Jesse Jackson, who confronted Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in 2014 about the company’s lack of diversity and unfair compensation, applauded its efforts to connect with engineers of color through partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and scholarship organizations. “They are clearly setting the pace, making measurable progress for three consecutive years. They’ve acted with intention, not just aspiration,” Jackson said in a statement. Amazon Inc, which employs a large number of workers at distribution centers, reported late last year that its ethnic diversity exceeded the U.S. average, with a global workforce that was 21 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic, 11 percent Asian and 5 percent other ethnicities. In management positions at Amazon, however, representation dropped to 4 percent for blacks and Hispanics, 3 percent for other races, and climbed to 20 percent for Asians. "

"2016-09-30",-23,"VirnetX and Apple have been fighting over patents for years. The case began in 2010 when VirnetX, a Nevada-based patent licensor, filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas federal court, claiming infringement of four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links.     A jury in 2012 awarded $368.2 million in damages, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., partly overturned that verdict, saying there were problems with how the trial judge instructed jurors on calculating damages.      On remand, VirnetX’s two suits were combined, and in February, a jury returned with an even bigger verdict, $625.6 million, one of the highest ever in a U.S. patent case.      However, Schroeder later voided the result, saying that the repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors and were unfair to Apple.      In the latest trial, jurors were asked to determine damages on two VirnetX patents that Apple had already been found to infringe, and to determine both infringement and damages on another two patents. The $302.4 million award was in line with what VirnetX had been demanding.  Apple spokeswoman Rachel Tulley declined to comment. An attorney for VirnetX could not immediately be reached. According to court documents, Apple is to face another court proceeding over whether it willfully infringed the patents, which could lead to higher damages.      Apple will also have to contend with the trial in a second lawsuit VirnetX filed against Apple over newer versions of Apple security features, as well as its iMessage application.     Many patent cases are handled in the Texas court, which has a reputation for awarding favorable verdicts to plaintiffs alleging infringement.     VirnetX had been assigned the four patents by Science Applications International Corp in 2006, court papers show.     The case is VirnetX Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 10-417.        "

Apple shares, which closed up 0.6 percent on Wednesday when the new phones were launched, were down more than 2 percent at $106.04 in morning trading on Thursday. They had closed down nearly 2 percent last year on the day the 6s and 6s Plus were unveiled. The iPhone 7 is priced at $649, the same as its predecessor, the 6s. The larger iPhone 7 Plus edition will retail for $769 - $20 more than the iPhone 6s Plus - and will feature two cameras, including a telephoto lens. Wells Fargo expects Apple to sell between 14-15 million of the new iPhones in the first weekend as the phones will be released in more countries that in previous years. The company sold more than 13 million of the 6s and 6s Plus phones in the first weekend after their launch last year. The new phones will start shipping in major markets, including the United States and China, on Sept. 16. That would give Apple 14 days of sales this quarter, compared with two days for the iPhone 6s in the year-ago quarter. The company said on Thursday it will not release first-weekend iPhone sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. IPhone sales account for more than half of Apple’s revenue. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said Apple margins could get a boost from the new iPhone, driven by sales of the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus model that has a comparatively richer feature set. Apple typically refreshes the iPhone every year, but goes in for a big makeover once in two years. However, many are expecting a three-year cycle this time, leading up to a major redesign in 2017. “While iPhone 8 has the potential to be a big cycle, we believe there is limited visibility given the off cycle and, if history is an indicator, believe it too early to be investable,” Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said. Um lowered his rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Oppenhemier said the new glossy jet black color - available only with the 128 GB and 256 GB storage versions - will boost the average selling price of the iPhone. Craig Hallum said it expected Apple to sell 211 million iPhones in the fiscal year ending September - marking the first ever year-over-year decline in annual sales - before bouncing back to an estimated 221 million in devices sales in 2017 and 240 million in 2018.

"2016-08-29",-10,"The plaintiffs linked the problem to Apple’s decision not to use a metal “shield” or “underfill” to protect the relevant parts, as it did on versions of the iPhone 5. “The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect,” according to the complaint filed in federal court in San Jose, California. Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania are the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which accuses Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws.

"2016-12-19",-4,"Shifting public perception has an effect. Customer dissatisfaction could keep multinationals from overly-aggressive minimisation of tax bills in future. But without clear rules, companies are currently engaging in a bizarre guessing game over what might constitute fair. Trump could deliver more lasting reforms. The United States’ high corporation tax rate of 35 percent and an exemption for foreign profits are a big cause and symptom of the current distortions: U.S. firms have an estimated $2.5 trillion stashed abroad, according to forecaster Capital Economics. The incoming president wants to slash the headline level to a more competitive level and make it less costly for companies to repatriate their cash. Other changes would be needed. Maarten de Wilde, an academic at Erasmus University Rotterdam, lists three: treat all companies as one entity, no matter how many countries it operates in; grant tax breaks for equity investment to match those for debt; and tax revenue instead of profit. If Trump were to, say, introduce the first, today’s Irish spat over Apple could end up looking like yesterday’s tax war. "

But he noted that Microsoft Corp’s  competing Surface notebook allowed touch on its main screen. “A lot of people spend a lot of time on these machines. The key for them is incremental innovations that make their job easier,” said Bajarin. “That’s value.”   The new pricing is roughly line with expectations, Bajarin said, but it surprised some. On Twitter, many potential buyers were underwhelmed by the new features and posted pictures of people crying about the new prices. Others tweeted that they hoped for more products. Apple shares fell 1.2 percent. The buttons, which change depending on what programs the user is running, effectively act as a second screen, showing older versions of a picture being edited, for example. Other computer makers have chosen to use touch screens for the main display screen, including Microsoft’s first-ever desktop and a revamped Surface Book laptop, launched on Wednesday. The 15-inch notebook will start at $2,399, compared with $1,999 for the previous version.  The Mac line accounted for about 11 percent of Apple sales in the just-finished fiscal year, with the number of machines sold down by 10 percent to 18.5 million.

"2016-09-08",6,"Axing the jack, they say, paves the way for discreet, bean-sized earbuds that can simultaneously translate, filter out unwanted noise or let us control other devices by voice - and drive up the value of the so-called ‘hearables’ market to $16 billion within five years. It’s the vision of the futuristic 2013 movie “Her”, where a human has a love affair with a disembodied voice in his ear. But some who follow the industry say it’s closer than many think, noting improvements in wireless technologies, materials, artificial intelligence and battery life. “It’s surprisingly close,” says Nick Hunn, a UK-based consultant who works with manufacturers and a group defining the short-range wireless Bluetooth standard. “It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices,” said Phil Schiller, senior VP of worldwide marketing, announcing the launch of AirPods, Apple’s own wireless earbuds using the firm’s new wireless W1 chip, and costing $159. “We’re just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we’ve been working towards for many years,” added chief design officer Jonathan Ive. And that great uncabling has already begun. Speakers were first: more than 100 million wireless speakers will be sold this year, most of them using Bluetooth, according to SAR Insight and Consulting. Now it’s headsets: spending on wireless headsets overtook wired ones last year, says Steven LeBoeuf, founder of Valencell, a developer of biometric sensor technology for wearable devices. The next step is to make those earphones smarter. German wireless earbud start-up Bragi, for example, last week announced a partnership to hook up its earbuds with IBM’s (IBM.N) artificial intelligence engine, Watson. IBM said users would be able to communicate, monitor vital signs, receive and give instructions and translate from one language to another using Bragi’s smart earphones. Firefighters would be better able to hear and locate victims and colleagues, and co-workers could collaborate using both hands, said Bragi CEO Nikolaj Hviid. “This is not about making headphones,” he said. “It’s about taking the user interface from your eyes and hand and having a much more discreet one when needed. It’s part of a bigger puzzle.” Apple pointed to improvements in its Siri voice control software, which can be activated by double tapping the AirPod. Other major technology companies are also making strides, with Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Alexa software letting you control an Internet-connected speaker with your voice. Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) has its own version. Among China’s technology leaders, Baidu (BIDU.O) is working on improving transcribing speech, and says its Deep Speech 2 system can transcribe English and Chinese about three times faster than a human. It says the number of voice interactions with its products has tripled since the start of last year. Valencell has focused on putting biometrics in the earbud, such as measuring the user’s heart rate. Its technology can be found in over a dozen products so far, says LeBoeuf. Bragi has worked on solving some of the problems connecting two wireless buds with a device and with each other, and wants to “bring intelligence to wearables,” says Hviid. But there are still teething problems. Hviid says Bragi’s latest earbuds, launched this week, resolve many of the issues that drew criticism in the first generation product. Others say artificial intelligence is still not there, though it’s much better than even a few years ago. “Apple’s AI is not ready now,” says Gonzalo Tudela, CEO of Vandrico Solutions, an enterprise wearables software company. Samsung last month launched its IconX wireless earbuds, which include biometrics, while Sony’s (6758.T) Xperia Ear promises to deliver weather and message notifications via voice, and to recognize input either by voice or head movements. LG Electronics (066570.KS) said last week it was including Alexa in its SmartThinQ Hub, a device used to connect home appliances over the Internet. And some are already pioneering the next step - where voice commands are unnecessary.  U.S. start-up Emotiv Systems is selling a $300 headset that allows the user to control software with the mind and face. This, says David Vivancos, an adviser to the company, is part of a shift “to custom apps that learn from your usage. Your app and my app will soon not be the same.” In the “Her” movie, the operating system becomes more and more personal. “There’s a case to be made for a hearable OS,” says Mari Joller, Scarlet’s founder and CEO, “which capitalizes on the combination of sensors, mobility, context and privacy to enable experiences that are in many ways even more intimate and powerful than the smartphone.” "
"2016-10-26",2,"The makeover quirk mirrors a broader view among some Chinese users that the iPhone 7 doesn’t have enough new features to convince them to trade up. “I don’t have the money to upgrade, and the (iPhone) 7 is just so-so,” said a Beijing-based sales worker, who said he was getting a Shenzhen firm to replace his iPhone 6 back casing with a fake iPhone 7 shell. “I‘m changing it to show off,” he said, giving only his surname Gao as he wasn’t sure that what he was doing was legal. Searches on platforms including Alibaba’s Taobao showed a range of products to transform older phones to an iPhone 7 - from stickers and engraving services to replacing the outer casing and even some of the hardware. “Now people have money and the Internet, these [modifications] are very convenient to do,” said Hu Benshu, who owns an electronics retail outlet in Beijing’s popular Zhongguancun technology hub. He added that at his store, Apple’s iPhone 4 - launched six years ago - is still the best-seller because of its durability. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. firm posted a third straight quarter of declining iPhone sales globally on Tuesday, and said Greater China revenue slipped 30 percent to $8.79 billion in July-September - despite the partial impact of the new iPhone launch. The company said any bump from iPhone 7 sales would not be seen fully until the current quarter, and a jump in sales was just around the corner. “I think Q4 looks promising for Apple in China as long as they ensure supply of the larger 7 Plus,” said Canalys analyst Nicole Peng.  Apple has struggled with supply issues, causing some demand gaps in China, particularly for the large screen iPhone 7 Plus and the coveted jet black model. “The iPhone 7 series should help Apple regain lost (China) market share as demand is tracking better than for the iPhone 6s series,” said Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah. “(But) Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users who are warming to local brands.” But consumers and retailers said the iPhone maker faces an uphill task to convert Samsung fans. One Samsung user wrote online that “an exploding Note 7 is still better than an un-innovative iPhone 7.” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Tuesday it was “impossible to know” if there was any effect yet from Samsung halting production of its Note 7 phones. Of six ex-Samsung smartphone users Reuters spoke to in China, only one said he would consider switching to the iPhone 7, which was seen lacking ground-breaking features. “The iPhone 7 design was ... not much of an upgrade,” said Zhao Bo, a 26-year-old student from Jilin province, who plans to buy a Samsung C9 Pro after returning his Note 7. “There’s no headphone jack and the price is so much higher,” he said, noting also that Samsung is offering subsidies to users who trade in their Note 7 for another Samsung phone. Some carriers have made a marketing push on the iPhone 7 to fill the Note 7 vacuum, but the effect is limited partly due to Samsung’s own declining market share and to shoppers possibly holding off until Apple launches a new model, expected next year. “I‘m waiting for a big upgrade,” said Gao, the Beijing salesman, adding he’d only buy the next new phone if there were significant changes. “I‘m going to see what it’s like; it really depends.” "

But some who follow the industry say it’s closer than many think, noting improvements in wireless technologies, materials, artificial intelligence and battery life. “It’s surprisingly close,” says Nick Hunn, a UK-based consultant who works with manufacturers and a group defining the short-range wireless Bluetooth standard. “It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices,” said Phil Schiller, senior VP of worldwide marketing, announcing the launch of AirPods, Apple’s own wireless earbuds using the firm’s new wireless W1 chip, and costing $159. “We’re just at the beginning of a truly wireless future we’ve been working towards for many years,” added chief design officer Jonathan Ive. And that great uncabling has already begun. Speakers were first: more than 100 million wireless speakers will be sold this year, most of them using Bluetooth, according to SAR Insight and Consulting. Now it’s headsets: spending on wireless headsets overtook wired ones last year, says Steven LeBoeuf, founder of Valencell, a developer of biometric sensor technology for wearable devices. The next step is to make those earphones smarter. German wireless earbud start-up Bragi, for example, last week announced a partnership to hook up its earbuds with IBM’s (IBM.N) artificial intelligence engine, Watson. IBM said users would be able to communicate, monitor vital signs, receive and give instructions and translate from one language to another using Bragi’s smart earphones. Firefighters would be better able to hear and locate victims and colleagues, and co-workers could collaborate using both hands, said Bragi CEO Nikolaj Hviid. “This is not about making headphones,” he said. “It’s about taking the user interface from your eyes and hand and having a much more discreet one when needed. It’s part of a bigger puzzle.” Apple pointed to improvements in its Siri voice control software, which can be activated by double tapping the AirPod. Other major technology companies are also making strides, with Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Alexa software letting you control an Internet-connected speaker with your voice. Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) has its own version. Among China’s technology leaders, Baidu (BIDU.O) is working on improving transcribing speech, and says its Deep Speech 2 system can transcribe English and Chinese about three times faster than a human. It says the number of voice interactions with its products has tripled since the start of last year. Valencell has focused on putting biometrics in the earbud, such as measuring the user’s heart rate. Its technology can be found in over a dozen products so far, says LeBoeuf. Bragi has worked on solving some of the problems connecting two wireless buds with a device and with each other, and wants to “bring intelligence to wearables,” says Hviid. But there are still teething problems. Hviid says Bragi’s latest earbuds, launched this week, resolve many of the issues that drew criticism in the first generation product. Others say artificial intelligence is still not there, though it’s much better than even a few years ago. “Apple’s AI is not ready now,” says Gonzalo Tudela, CEO of Vandrico Solutions, an enterprise wearables software company. Samsung last month launched its IconX wireless earbuds, which include biometrics, while Sony’s (6758.T) Xperia Ear promises to deliver weather and message notifications via voice, and to recognize input either by voice or head movements. LG Electronics (066570.KS) said last week it was including Alexa in its SmartThinQ Hub, a device used to connect home appliances over the Internet. And some are already pioneering the next step - where voice commands are unnecessary.  U.S. start-up Emotiv Systems is selling a $300 headset that allows the user to control software with the mind and face. This, says David Vivancos, an adviser to the company, is part of a shift “to custom apps that learn from your usage. Your app and my app will soon not be the same.” In the “Her” movie, the operating system becomes more and more personal. “There’s a case to be made for a hearable OS,” says Mari Joller, Scarlet’s founder and CEO, “which capitalizes on the combination of sensors, mobility, context and privacy to enable experiences that are in many ways even more intimate and powerful than the smartphone.” "

Apple fell 0.8 percent to $116.38 after Nokia  said it had filed a number of lawsuits against the iPhone maker for patent infringement. The stock was the biggest drag on all three major indexes. The market showed little reaction to data showing that the U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the third quarter, notching up its best performance in two years. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 3.2 percent pace, the Commerce Department said in its third GDP estimate. “With less traders on their desks and most investors planning where to spend their New Year’s Eve, markets have clearly entered the holiday mood,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “We can barely see any significant moves in equities, fixed income or even currency markets today, suggesting that more consolidation is expected throughout the remaining days of 2016.” U.S. stocks have rallied since the Nov. 8 election, with the Dow up about 9 percent and the S&P 6 percent as investors expect the economy to benefit from President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for deregulation and infrastructure spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been threatening to breach the historic 20,000 mark for the last several days, but has failed to do so. At 9:39 a.m. ET (1439 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 26.77 points, or 0.13 percent, at 19,915.19. The S&P 500 was down 5 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,260.18. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.37 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,457.06. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index’s 0.40 percent fall leading the decliners. Other economic data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose to a six-month high last week, but remained below a level that is associated with labor market strength. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 21,000 to 275,000 for the week ended Dec. 17. Micron Technology shares jumped 11.6 percent to $22.97 after the chipmaker’s profit forecast beat expectations. Red Hat fell 12.2 percent to $70.20 after the Linux OS distributor’s quarterly revenue fell below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,489 to 1,075. On the Nasdaq, 1,327 issues fell and 866 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 33 new highs and 21 new lows.

They don’t care about the normal people,” said O‘Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. “The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive.” O‘Reilly’s mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of 1,050 euros ($1,170), a higher rate than the EU said Apple’s main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. Gerard Augusta, a 56-year-old security guard from Dublin, said the government should take Apple’s money and put it into housing and hospitals. “I think the unions and the workers should be out marching about it, to be honest with you.

"2016-09-02",-8,"“EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws. State aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules,” Kroes wrote in the Guardian. “However, the current state aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that.” Asked about the article at a regular news briefing on Friday, chief Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said:  “We understand that it may be sometimes challenging to reconcile the role as a former commissioner with the temptation to publicly express the views of those in Silicon Valley or elsewhere who oppose the Commission’s decisions.” Kroes, a Dutch liberal who left Brussels when Jean-Claude Juncker replaced Jose Manuel Barroso as Commission president in 2014, now sits on the public policy board of Uber. The Silicon Valley company that runs the ride-hailing app is lobbying the Commission to do more to challenge national rules across the Union that have curbed Uber’s development in Europe. Schinas said Kroes’s criticism of Vestager’s use of EU laws that ban governments giving firms unfair “state aid” -- in Apple’s case via a tax deal -- was incorrect: “State aid rules ... were not applied in the way it was alleged,” he said.

"2016-08-03",-2,"As of June, Apple’s overall U.S. workforce was 56 percent white (up 2 percent from a year ago), 19 percent Asian (down 1 percent) 12 percent Hispanic (up 1 percent), and 9 percent black (up 1 percent).  Apple’s workforce includes a pool of retail employees that Google and Facebook do not have. In Apple stores, blacks and Hispanics respectively comprised 12 percent and 17 percent of general employees, and 5 percent and 10 percent of the leadership. At Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, blacks and Hispanics respectively made up 2 and 3 percent of the overall workforce and 1 and 3 percent of its tech employees, little changed from last year.  At Facebook, blacks and Hispanics were respectively 2 and 4 percent of the workforce and 1 and 3 percent of tech employees.  Apple’s global workforce was 32 percent women, up 1 percent from the end of June 2015. Women held 23 percent of technical positions, up 1 percent from a year ago, and 28 percent of leadership positions, unchanged from June last year.    Reverend Jesse Jackson, who confronted Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in 2014 about the company’s lack of diversity and unfair compensation, applauded its efforts to connect with engineers of color through partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and scholarship organizations. “They are clearly setting the pace, making measurable progress for three consecutive years. They’ve acted with intention, not just aspiration,” Jackson said in a statement. Amazon Inc, which employs a large number of workers at distribution centers, reported late last year that its ethnic diversity exceeded the U.S. average, with a global workforce that was 21 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic, 11 percent Asian and 5 percent other ethnicities. In management positions at Amazon, however, representation dropped to 4 percent for blacks and Hispanics, 3 percent for other races, and climbed to 20 percent for Asians. "
"2016-08-29",-10,"The plaintiffs linked the problem to Apple’s decision not to use a metal “shield” or “underfill” to protect the relevant parts, as it did on versions of the iPhone 5. “The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect,” according to the complaint filed in federal court in San Jose, California. Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania are the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which accuses Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws. They seek unspecified damages. Apple did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment.  Problems with iPhone 6 touchscreens were described online last week by iFixit, which labeled the issue “Touch Disease.” That company sells repair parts and has previously analyzed other Apple products.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, sold 166.4 million iPhones, generating $108.5 billion of net sales, in the first nine months of its current fiscal year. The case is Davidson et al v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-04942.     "
"2016-10-26",2,"The makeover quirk mirrors a broader view among some Chinese users that the iPhone 7 doesn’t have enough new features to convince them to trade up. “I don’t have the money to upgrade, and the (iPhone) 7 is just so-so,” said a Beijing-based sales worker, who said he was getting a Shenzhen firm to replace his iPhone 6 back casing with a fake iPhone 7 shell. “I‘m changing it to show off,” he said, giving only his surname Gao as he wasn’t sure that what he was doing was legal. Searches on platforms including Alibaba’s Taobao showed a range of products to transform older phones to an iPhone 7 - from stickers and engraving services to replacing the outer casing and even some of the hardware. “Now people have money and the Internet, these [modifications] are very convenient to do,” said Hu Benshu, who owns an electronics retail outlet in Beijing’s popular Zhongguancun technology hub. He added that at his store, Apple’s iPhone 4 - launched six years ago - is still the best-seller because of its durability. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. firm posted a third straight quarter of declining iPhone sales globally on Tuesday, and said Greater China revenue slipped 30 percent to $8.79 billion in July-September - despite the partial impact of the new iPhone launch. The company said any bump from iPhone 7 sales would not be seen fully until the current quarter, and a jump in sales was just around the corner. “I think Q4 looks promising for Apple in China as long as they ensure supply of the larger 7 Plus,” said Canalys analyst Nicole Peng.  Apple has struggled with supply issues, causing some demand gaps in China, particularly for the large screen iPhone 7 Plus and the coveted jet black model. “The iPhone 7 series should help Apple regain lost (China) market share as demand is tracking better than for the iPhone 6s series,” said Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah. “(But) Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users who are warming to local brands.” But consumers and retailers said the iPhone maker faces an uphill task to convert Samsung fans. One Samsung user wrote online that “an exploding Note 7 is still better than an un-innovative iPhone 7.” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Tuesday it was “impossible to know” if there was any effect yet from Samsung halting production of its Note 7 phones. Of six ex-Samsung smartphone users Reuters spoke to in China, only one said he would consider switching to the iPhone 7, which was seen lacking ground-breaking features. “The iPhone 7 design was ... not much of an upgrade,” said Zhao Bo, a 26-year-old student from Jilin province, who plans to buy a Samsung C9 Pro after returning his Note 7. “There’s no headphone jack and the price is so much higher,” he said, noting also that Samsung is offering subsidies to users who trade in their Note 7 for another Samsung phone. Some carriers have made a marketing push on the iPhone 7 to fill the Note 7 vacuum, but the effect is limited partly due to Samsung’s own declining market share and to shoppers possibly holding off until Apple launches a new model, expected next year. “I‘m waiting for a big upgrade,” said Gao, the Beijing salesman, adding he’d only buy the next new phone if there were significant changes. “I‘m going to see what it’s like; it really depends.” "

Apple’s shares were up 5.1 percent at $127.40 after the company’s earnings and iPhone sales blew past expectations in the latest quarter. The stock was the top boost to all the three main indexes and added 40 points to the Dow’s 90-point rise. “With a bellwether company such as Apple reporting an encouraging set of numbers, it has brought the focus of investors back on company fundamentals,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. While Apple opened at its highest level since July 2015, shares of other technology heavyweights also jumped. Facebook , which is expected to report after markets close, was up 1.1 percent. Alphabet and Nvidia also rose. Investors are closely tracking quarterly earnings to support valuations, especially after a post-election rally pushed Wall Street to record highs. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged in its first policy meeting after President Donald Trump took office as the central bank seeks greater clarity on his economic policies. Investors will parse the Fed’s policy statement, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), for any changes following a string of strong economic data. Sentiment was also boosted by a report that showed U.S.  U.S. private employers added 246,000 jobs in January, the most in seven months, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market. The report acts as a precursor to the more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.

Investors are closely tracking quarterly earnings to support valuations, especially after a post-election rally pushed Wall Street to record highs. Apple’s shares were up 4.40 percent at $126.69 in heavy premarket trading after the company’s earnings and iPhone sales blew past expectations in the latest quarter. “With a bellwether company such as Apple reporting an encouraging set of numbers, it has brought the focus of investors back on company fundamentals,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. While Apple is set to open at its highest level since July 2015, shares of other technology heavyweights also gained. Facebook, which is expected to report after markets close, was up 1.24 percent. Alphabet, Microsoft  and Nvidia were also up. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged in its first policy meeting after President Donald Trump took office as the central bank seeks greater clarity on his economic policies. However, investors will parse the Fed’s policy statement, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), for any changes following a string of strong economic data. Boosting investor sentiment was a report that showed U.S. private employers hired 246,000 people in January, far exceeding the 165,000 that economists had expected. The report acts as a precursor to the more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due Friday. Dow e-minis were up 63 points, or 0.32 percent at 8:22 a.m. ET, with 19,403 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 7 points, or 0.31 percent, with 117,061 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 33.25 points, or 0.65 percent, on volume of 24,162 contracts. Trump’s comments and decisions are also on investors’ crosshairs, especially after he placed curbs on travel to the United States, a move that unleashed uncertainty on Wall Street and declines in the past few days. “Trump is a wild card and someone who can say something at any given time and drive the markets into short-term disarray,” Bakhos said. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell on Tuesday amid concerns over the Trump administration’s priorities. The Nasdaq Composite index  managed to get a lift from biotech stocks after Trump promised to ease regulations in the pharmaceutical industry. Apple’s influence extended to other parts of the technology industry. Apple suppliers Cirrus Logic, Skyworks Solutions were up more than 2 percent premarket. Oneok Partners jumped 28 percent to $55.24 after biggest shareholder Oneok Inc said it would buy the rest of the company for $9.3 billion.

State aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules,” Kroes wrote in the Guardian. “However, the current state aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that.” Asked about the article at a regular news briefing on Friday, chief Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: “We understand that it may be sometimes challenging to reconcile the role as a former commissioner with the temptation to publicly express the views of those in Silicon Valley or elsewhere who oppose the Commission’s decisions.” Kroes, a Dutch liberal who left Brussels when Jean-Claude Juncker replaced Jose Manuel Barroso as Commission president in 2014, now sits on the public policy board of Uber. The Silicon Valley company that runs the ride-hailing app is lobbying the Commission to do more to challenge national rules across the Union that have curbed Uber’s development in Europe. Schinas said Kroes’s criticism of Vestager’s use of EU laws that ban governments giving firms unfair “state aid” -- in Apple’s case via a tax deal -- was incorrect: “State aid rules ... were not applied in the way it was alleged,” he said.

Apple rose 1.3 percent, helping all three major indexes, after Canada’s Competition Bureau said it did not find sufficient evidence iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company.

"2016-08-31",-12,"Dublin has just over two months at the latest to make an appeal against the Commission’s ruling that the U.S. tech giant should hand over to Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) ruled to be illegal state aid. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down a tax windfall that would be enough to fund the country’s health service for a year, and this appears to be complicating the cabinet decision whether to fight the ruling. “Following the discussion, it was agreed to allow further time to reflect on the issues and to clarify a number of legal and technical issues with the Attorney General’s Office and with officials,” the government press office said in a statement. Apple, one of many major multinationals whose European headquarters are based in Ireland, has said it will appeal the decision and a failure by the Irish government to join them could undermine the country’s pro-business credentials. Noonan said on Tuesday he “disagreed profoundly” with what he called a bizarre order from the Commission. However, the Independent Alliance - a group of independent lawmakers represented in the minority coalition government - said on Tuesday that they were reviewing the EU’s decision and would need to consult further with Noonan, tax officials and independent experts.   If the Independent Alliance refused to back an appeal and pulled out of the government, Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party would no longer have sufficient support in parliament to pass legislation. That would prompt the collapse of the government, analysts said. “The government can’t survive without the Independent Alliance,” said Eoin O‘Malley, politics lecturer at Dublin City University. “(But) the way the Independent Alliance appear to work is that they have cabinet (discussions) first and then discuss it with each other. I would be more concerned if in a week’s time the cabinet hadn’t agreed.” Both parties were criticized by left-wing Sinn Fein, the country’s third largest party. It said the government should accept the Commission’s ruling and impose the tax bill on the iPhone maker. It also increased pressure on the Independent Alliance, which agreed to go into coalition in May only after an unprecedented 10 weeks of post-election talks and has already  broken ranks on another vote.  “It is important that Irish taxpayers are represented. The Independent Alliance have an opportunity to do that. They should oppose any appeal and insist that the correct tax bill is paid by Apple,” Sinn Fein’s David Cullinane said in a statement. “They are doing the wrong thing. They don’t care about the normal people,” said Louise O‘Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. “There’s two laws in this country, one for the rich and one for the poor.” At stake for Ireland is the lure of its low corporate tax rate, a cornerstone of economic policy for decades that has drawn investors from large multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country’s workers. The Apple decision also comes as Ireland seeks to market itself as one of the top locations for any companies considering moving operations from Britain after its vote to leave the EU.   Dublin has already seen a jump in inquiries, particularly from financial services firms. The Commission’s drive could check that advantage. The U.S. Treasury warned that the move threatened to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said it would welcome any company that is prepared to invest in the United Kingdom. Others on the streets of Dublin shared the government’s concerns. “People need to educate themselves. If we take the 13 billion we’ll have a catastrophe jobs wise,” said Tracey Whelan, 46, an accountant for a private equity firm in Dublin.    “Obviously we’d love it... but it’s a poisoned apple.” "

China’s slowing economy is stocking concerns about Apple’s prospects there. The company’s online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms.  Apple has lost intellectual property battles in China and faces anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers there.

"2016-09-23",-10,"Apple was not named in that report, but two senior government sources told Reuters that regulators were also focusing on Apple’s supply agreements with all three carriers.     Under those deals, surplus stock of older iPhones is kept out of the market and sent to overseas markets, such as Hong Kong, according to industry sources. The carriers, locked in a costly battle to win consumers who covet iPhones, also bulk purchase the Apple smartphones and sell them at a discount, which gives the U.S. company an advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co, according to the two government officials and an industry source. Both iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 edge model sell for 93,960 yen ($932) under Docomo’s main service package without any contract, but the cost for the iPhone drops sharply to 38,232 yen with a two-year contract, while the Galaxy falls to 54,432 yen. When asked about the antitrust concerns, Apple forwarded a link to a webpage published at the time of the Aug. 2 FTC report that says it has created or supports 715,000 jobs in Japan with Japanese-based developers raking in more than $9 billion in revenue from Apple apps since 2008. It did not comment further. It also kept new mobile service providers such as messaging app firm Line Corp and online retailer Rakuten Inc from selling iPhones, and helped the top three carriers control more than 90 percent of the mobile phone market. “The actions of the three operators alone do not account for the state of the market,” said one of the officials, who confirmed that the August report was also directed at Apple. “We are getting closer to taking action.” The officials said the watchdog hoped pressing the carriers would get them to solve the antitrust issue, which could include renegotiating contracts with Apple.  They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. In the past, FTC has issued cease and desist orders, and imposed a “surplus charge” to recoup profits resulting from antitrust violations. The biggest surplus charge to date for a case, which involved five companies, is 27 billion yen ($269 million). Fines on companies judged to be operating cartels or monopolies, however, can be higher.

"2012-03-08",-2,"Other analysts say the faster processing may begin to draw heavy gamers, encroaching on turf now dominated by gaming-hardware makers such as Microsoft or Sony. Chief Executive Tim Cook, presiding over his second major product launch after debuting with 2011’s voice-enabled iPhone 4S, introduced the highly anticipated third iteration of the tablet, which is available for pre-orders from Wednesday and will hit store shelves March 16. But he stumped many in the audience by breaking away from the tradition of calling the third-generation tablet the iPad 3, as some had expected, referring to it simply as the “new iPad.” The company said it will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100. The older tablet now starts at $399 while the new third-generation wi-fi only iPad starts at $499. The high-end model of Apple’s latest iPad starts at $629 and will be capable of operating on a high-speed 4G “LTE,” or Long-Term Evolution, network. At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology, that may help banish the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices. Wall Street had anticipated many of the features Cook showed off on Wednesday, including a higher-definition “retina display” screen - containing several times as many pixels within the same area - and a better camera. Shares of Apple closed barely higher, up 43 cents at $530.69. They hovered around $530 throughout the unveiling event, which was attended by Marc Benioff, CEO of enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce.com Inc; Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of online business review site Yelp Inc; and influential venture-capitalist John Doerr, among other industry luminaries. Some had held out hope of a positive Apple surprise, recalling late CEO Steve Jobs and his now-iconic “one more thing” at the very end of such announcements. Others said the upgrades and tweaks to the iPad could only go so far in fending off hard-charging competition. “While the hardware is notably enhanced, with an impressive retina display, better camera and faster processor, there are still some areas of improvement that Apple needs to work on, in order to stay ahead of its encroaching competitors,” said Fred Huet, managing partner at Greenwich Consulting. “As tablets are increasingly being used for personal media consumption, it is promising to see a better screen resolution. But will this be enough to ensure Apple’s competitive lead in the marketplace? No.” Others say Apple is betting a 4G-equipped iPad will tempt more U.S. consumers to pay for higher-quality video on the go. That, in turn, should give Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc a revenue boost, analysts say. here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> “THE NEW IPAD” Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, and AT&T will host and sell 4G wireless plans to 4G iPad users. An updated version of the WiFi-only model remains at $499. The most expensive 4G model, with 64 gigabytes of storage, will go for $829. The previous iPad2 with 3G also sold for $629 to $829. The cheapest model of the previous-generation iPad 2 now retails at $399. “The iPhone 4S showed us that Apple doesn’t need to out-do itself with new product designs to continue extending its domination of a category,” said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson. In an apparent departure from naming conventions, Apple’s third-generation tablet will not be called the iPad 3, but simply referred to as the latest iPad, a small point that several analysts and executives noticed and pointed out. Forrester analyst Frank Gillet said most of Apple’s other products, such as the iPod or the MacBook Pro, do not warrant new appellations every time they go through an upgrade. Apple may even drop the numerical extension for the iPhone, he added. Regardless of the name, the company is counting on a warm reception to its latest tablet to fend off an increasingly aggressive challenge from tablets powered by Google Inc’s Android technology, with Microsoft Corp software-driven devices slated to come soon. “Everyone’s been wondering who will come out with a product that’s more amazing than the iPad 2,” Cook said. Smartphones and tablets are starting to eat into PC sales as mobile technology gets more advanced and available content expands. Some experts believe mobile devices, as they get more powerful, will eventually displace PCs in many markets, hurting business for the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc. The global tablet user base reached 67 million in 2011, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Analysts expect double-digit growth in tablet sales in coming years. Cook also announced that the company’s new $99 Apple TV set-top box, a concept that late CEO Steve Jobs had called a “hobby,” now supports high-definition 1080p screen technology. “Last year alone we sold 172 million post-PC devices,” Cook told the audience at the Yerba Buena Center in downtown San Francisco, Apple’s preferred venue for product unveilings. “And this made up 76 percent of our revenues. This is incredible.” Cook’s performance was again the subject of scrutiny. The CEO replaced famed showman Jobs after the co-founder’s October death, and has since drawn several comparisons in terms of onstage charisma. Some in Wednesday’s audience found the event wanting. “This iPad 3 launch is horribly boring. Steve, I miss you terribly,” Salesforce’s Benioff tweeted at the end of the proceedings. “Tim Cook didn’t thank or remember Steve Jobs at iPad3 launch. There would be no iPad 3 without Steve Jobs.” "
"2017-01-06",5,"* 156,000 U.S. jobs added in Dec vs forecast 178,000 * All three major indexes hit intra-day record highs * Indexes up: Dow 0.43 pct, S&P 0.46 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct   (Updates with detail on Florida shooting, valuations, earnings outlook) By Noel Randewich Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will bolster the economy. All three major U.S. indexes were set to notch record high closes, helped by Apple. The iPhone maker climbed 1.16 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. U.S. stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 84.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 19,984.28 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63. The S&P 500 gained 10.56 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,279.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.75 points, or 0.72 percent, to 5,527.69. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.07 percent gain. The Nasdaq was on track to end the week up 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 headed for a 1.8 percent weekly rise while the Dow was on track to end 1.1 percent higher for the week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.7 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron  from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.3 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows.

"2017-02-01",2,"* Apple on track for largest pct gain since 2014 * S&P 500 financials turn lower in wake of Fed statement * Dow up 0.08 pct; S&P 500 down 0.07 pct; Nasdaq up 0.4 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 moved in and out of negative territory on Wednesday, buoyed by gains in Apple shares and after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, while painting a relatively upbeat picture of the U.S. economy. Apple shares rose 7.4 percent to $130.31 after touching $130.35, its highest in 18 months. The advance made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would all be negative for the day without Apple’s boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed’s policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. “Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic statement with regard to inflation,” said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed’s statement suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,884.38, the S&P 500 lost 1.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,277.85 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 24.61 points, or 0.44 percent, to 5,639.40. The S&P is struggling to cap a four-session losing streak, its largest since before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.3 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls fell 3.1 percent to $42.63 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 21 new lows.     (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

"2012-01-25",0,"Many investors have by now come to take the consumer electronics company’s annual performance metrics in stride, but here is a look at some of its more startling numbers, in context: - Market value: almost $400 billion Apple is hovering just a whisker off its record high. Many on the Street target $550 to $600 per share as an achievable milestone: assuming no change in existing shares, that would accord the Silicon Valley titan a value of as much as $560 billion, equivalent to the annual Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland. Exxon has a market value of $420 billion, annual revenue about four times Apple’s and twice the tech company’s roughly 46,000 employees. - Revenue grew 65 percent or $43 billion to $108.25 billion in fiscal 2011. - Apple’s shares, a mainstay of many fund portfolios, rose 25 percent in calendar 2011, tacking on $77 billion in market capitalization - close to Hewlett Packard Co’s and Dell Inc’s capitalization, combined. And yet Apple stock’s is valued at just 15 times projected earnings, compared with slower-growing Google Inc’s 21 times and Amazon.com Inc’s near-100 times. - Near $100 billion cash pile One of the reasons Apple’s shares trade at a relatively low multiple is because it has huge amounts of cash that investors say can be put to better use. Its cash balance stood at $97.6 billion at the end of December, roughly equivalent to California’s 2012/13 state budget. - Apple sold 37 million iPhones and more than 15 million iPads in the December quarter, meaning it moved 92.94 million iPhones and 40.43 million tablets in calendar 2011. If you laid them end-to-end, they would just about stretch halfway around the Earth’s circumference. "

"2016-09-16",2,"“I’ve been here for a week and a half,” said Andreas Francis. “I was trying to get the 7 Plus and the new jet black, but they don’t have the 7 Plus or the jet black, so I ended up getting the regular black, then the 7.” Initial quantities of the iPhone 7 Plus have sold out globally, supplies of the larger size of Apple’s new phone have been exhausted in all shades, and the smaller iPhone 7 has also sold out in the new jet black color, the company said. Customers who enter Apple Stores Friday, when the gadgets hit shelves, will not be able to purchase the sold-out phones on site, but they can continue to place orders for their desired models online, Apple said. “It’s actually the one thing I didn’t like actually, because I used to listen to music all day long,” said Rinat from Kazakhstan, on the elimination of the traditional headphone jack. “So when they decided to remove it I actually got really sad but I think I got used to it.” “It doesn’t bother me,” said Sulton Zohiriy. “Usually I don’t listen to a lot of music. The headphone is like the same but different, different jacks, that’s all.” The crowds of enthusiasts and overnight campers were smaller than in past years. In part, online pre-ordering has made lines unnecessary for all but diehard fans. “I actually pre-ordered it, so I was only in line for like, 20 minutes, it was super easy,” said Paige Hogan, who pre-ordered the 7 Plus. The 5.5-inch iPhone model, known as the Plus, has sold out soon after launch since Apple introduced the size with the iPhone 6 in 2014. Phones in newly released finishes are also typically snapped up quickly by customers eager to showcase the latest iPhone design."
"2016-09-13",0,"However, the companies did not disclose specific sales numbers. Pre-orders started on Friday. Details about sales of the new iPhone are scarce after Apple announced last week it would not release weekend sales data, saying the number was more a reflection of supply than demand. “While the iPhone 7 update is more revolutionary than evolutionary, we believe investors could consider these strong early pre-order indications as being reflective of the impact of Apple’s significant iPhone installed base expansion over the past few years,” Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note. Rival carriers AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) were not immediately available for comment. Apple’s shares were up 2.8 percent at $108.19 in morning trading. Up to Monday’s close, they had fallen 2.1 percent since the iPhone 7 was launched on Wednesday. "
"2016-09-08",-3,"“As we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7,” Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said. “These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers.” The company reiterated its financial outlook for the quarter.  Apple launched the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus at a San Francisco event on Wednesday. The new phones feature improved cameras and eliminate the traditional headphone jack in favor of new technology. Preorders will begin on Friday, and Apple will start shipping the devices on Sept. 16. The stakes for the iPhone 7 are high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history. As they try to assess whether the iPhone has reached a plateau, investors will not be happy about losing a data point, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners.  Apple shares fell 2.4 percent to $105.71 in mid-day trading. On Sept. 28, 2015, when Apple announced record first-weekend sales of its iPhone 6, its stock dropped 2 percent, reflecting Wall Street’s worries about cooling demand. The iPhone is Apple’s lifeblood, accounting for more than half of the company’s revenue. In the most recent quarter, Apple recorded $42.4 billion in total revenue with $24 billion coming from the iPhone.  Investors have grown accustomed to receiving early sales figures, and Apple’s decision to hold back seems significant, said analyst John Jackson of IDC. “It reinforces, I think, the thesis that this product is mature,” he said. Nevertheless, sales logged when the supply chain is ramping up only reveal so much about the gadget’s ultimate trajectory, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights Strategy.  “What’s meaningful to me are the first month of sales with full supply,” he said.

"2016-08-09",-2,"It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands. Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media. The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word “Olympics”, which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colors, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week. “While they don’t appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing,” said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the U.S. Olympic Committee. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment on the bands, which are selling for 296 reais ($92.80) each - and only from the U.S. tech giant’s store in Barra de Tijuca. Another top Olympics sponsor, Swatch Group’s Omega, which makes an Olympic watch and is Games timekeeper, showed no concern. Omega president Raynald Aeschlimann said that unlike his firm, Apple could not talk about its Olympics history. Apple is also not permitted to display its limited-edition bands alongside the Olympics logo, or any other obvious Games symbol, but that has not stopped some Apple fans from doing so. Top Olympic sponsors can pay about $100 million over four years to the International Olympic Committee for exclusive marketing rights to the Games, and they keep a close watch for any guerilla marketing during the event by their rivals. So far, Apple is in the clear. Athletes can also fall foul of Olympic rules if they market a non-official sponsor’s products during the Games - but not if they do it well before the event. Bromell shared his photo of the Apple band and his Olympic tattoo on July 21, six days before the blackout period began. Apple is not promoting the new bands directly - many buyers say they are reading about them on blogs - but at least one customer says he regards the band as Olympics merchandising. Nelson Imana, a visiting sports fan from Chicago, bought two bands on the way to watch Olympic volleyball. He said they reminded him of the kind of exclusive merchandise sold at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. “If you see somebody with Masters gear, they’ll ask you about it because you can only buy it there,” Imana said. “So if they see this band, they’ll say OK, you’ve probably been to Rio and the Olympics.” "

"2016-09-07",1,"By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The iPhone 7 is expected to make its global debut on Wednesday, but many consumers and investors are already setting their sights on Apple Inc’s  2017 version of the popular gadget, hoping for more significant advances. At its annual product launch in San Francisco on Wednesday, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company is expected by blogs and analysts to reveal an iPhone without a headphone jack, paving the way for wireless headphones, a touch-sensitive home button that vibrates, double-lens cameras for the larger ‘Plus’ edition and other incremental improvements. Apple typically gives its main product, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, a big makeover every other year and the last major redesign was the iPhone 6, in 2014. The modest updates suggest that this cycle will be three years. “It looks like part of the reason they are keeping the design the same this year is there are bigger changes they are working on for next year,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Sales of the iPhone dropped two quarters in a row this year, the first declines in the history of the device. With many consumers who purchased the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus due for an upgrade, Apple may eke out single-digit gains in sales for the 7, Dawson said. But some consumer technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading until the next year’s version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a wider display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. Wall Street is impatient for growth, and Apple will be hard-pressed to reverse the downward trend this year, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “The iPhone 7 runs the risk of disappointing investors,” he said. Consumers are waiting longer before replacing their phones, a shift that Apple must address in its product roadmap, said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies. Analysts predict the Apple Watch will be the second closely watched feature of the event. Apple is expected to revamp the wearable, released last year, with a faster processor and a GPS chip, enabling users to track runs and other workouts without their phones. Most analysts believe sales of Apple’s watch - which the company has not disclosed - have not yet justified the fanfare. Starting at $299, well above many other wearables on the market, the most meaningful change Apple can make is a price cut, Bajarin said. “This category is very price sensitive,” he said. Apple is “not there yet.”   (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

However, the Nasdaq, which is more weighted towards technology stocks, was lifted by a 6.4 percent rise in Apple  following the company’s strong earnings and iPhone sales. A rate hike is not the likely outcome of the Fed’s first meeting under President Donald Trump as the central bank awaits more clarity on his policies. But investors will dissect the statement, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET  (1900 GMT), to see how the policymakers view the economy under Trump and whether a recent spate of strong economic data alters their take on futures hikes. “We’re in a very stable market with a lot of cross-currents. Fourth-quarter earnings seem to be okay,” said Chuck Self, chief investment officer at iSectors LLC in Appleton, Wisconsin. “However, political uncertainty is making it hard for investors to have conviction in the market.” Investors has paid close attention to Trump’s comments and decisions, which have caused volatility. His latest move to restrict travel to the United States unleashed uncertainty and losses on Wall Street in the past few days. At 12:57 p.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.9 points, or 0.09 percent, at 19,881.99, the S&P 500  was down 1.96 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,276.91 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.79 points, or 0.35 percent, at 5,634.58. Investors hope quarterly earnings support valuations, especially after a post-election rally pushed Wall Street to record highs. Fourth-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 7.1 percent - the best growth in nine quarters - according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, investors are struggling with the question of whether the rally has gotten ahead of itself, Self said. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.6 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. The impact of robust private payrolls data also appeared to fizzle out. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with energy’s 1.2 percent loss dragging the broader index. Utilities, which pay high dividends and are considered bond proxies, lost 1.7 percent. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.4 percent after a string of price target cuts. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. While Apple provided the biggest boost to the three indexes after its stock hit an 18-month high, Microsoft fell 1.6 percent and dragged down the S&P and the Nasdaq. Pitney Bowes plunged 18 percent after the mail equipment maker posted fourth-quarter profit and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations.

The biggest iPhone technical improvements all had leaked, and Apple itself spoiled the surprise by sending out tweets of some details before Cook spoke. The company then deleted the messages. Apple has reported declines in iPhone sales for the last two quarters, which raised the stakes for the iPhone 7. Some consumers and analysts are considering waiting until 2017. “Just gonna wait on iPhone 8 cuz it’s the 10th anniversary of iPhone,” Tweeted @LewBruh near the end of the event. “Ya know they gonna do something big.” But Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments LLC in Minneapolis, said the new phone encouraged him that Apple was in good shape for a new sales cycle. “I think the iPhone 7, just from a replacement basis, will be a successful launch,” he said.  The world’s best-known technology company said the iPhone 7 would have one, zooming 12-megapixel camera. Starting at $649, it is the same price as the 6S predecessor. The larger 7 ‘Plus’ edition, starting at $769, would feature two cameras, including a telephoto lens. Apple also removed the analog headphone jack from both new models, as was widely expected. The new headphones supplied by Apple with the phone will plug into the same port as the recharging cord, making it incompatible with most wired headphones without an adaptor. Apple includes the adapter. The disappearance of the headphone jack “will probably annoy a certain amount of people” but they would likely get over it, Binger said. Apple described dropping the jack as an act of courage as it moved toward a wireless future with the optional Air Pods. Getting rid of the jack also increased room for stereo speakers, and Apple sharpened the technology on most features, from the camera to a pressure-sensitive home button to a boost in memory. The new phone will start shipping in major markets, including the United States and China, on Sept. 16.  “While the camera improvements for the iPhone 7 Plus are nice, they are incremental for most and the lack of headphone jacks could offset that for others,” he said.  Apple typically gives its main product, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, a big makeover every other year and the last major redesign was the iPhone 6 in 2014. Many are expecting a three-year cycle this time, culminating in a major redesign for 2017 to be called iPhone 8. Apple said its Apple Watch Series 2, with a swim-proof casing, will be available in more than 25 countries starting on Sept. 16. “I predict Watch sales will improve dramatically,” said Tech analyst Patrick Moorhead. “Most of the current Watch owners are early adopters and the next wave could be 10 times the size of that market.”     Apple also launched a new version of the device called the Apple Watch Nike+, in partnership with the athletic goods manufacturer Nike Inc (NKE.N), featuring GPS so athletes can track their runs.  Shares of Fitbit Inc (FIT.N), which makes activity-tracking bands, closed down 2 percent on the emergence of such a high-profile competitor. "

Apple’s stock has rallied 13 percent since mid-September on optimism about demand for the recently launched iPhone 7.

"2016-09-07",-1,"At its annual product launch in San Francisco on Wednesday, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company is expected by blogs and analysts to reveal an iPhone without a headphone jack, paving the way for wireless headphones, a touch-sensitive home button that vibrates, double-lens cameras for the larger ‘Plus’ edition and other incremental improvements. Apple typically gives its main product, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, a big makeover every other year and the last major redesign was the iPhone 6, in 2014. The modest updates suggest that this cycle will be three years. “It looks like part of the reason they are keeping the design the same this year is there are bigger changes they are working on for next year,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Sales of the iPhone dropped two quarters in a row this year, the first declines in the history of the device. With many consumers who purchased the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus due for an upgrade, Apple may eke out single-digit gains in sales for the 7, Dawson said. But some consumer technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading until the next year’s version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a wider display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. Wall Street is impatient for growth, and Apple will be hard-pressed to reverse the downward trend this year, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “The iPhone 7 runs the risk of disappointing investors,” he said. Consumers are waiting longer before replacing their phones, a shift that Apple must address in its product roadmap, said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies. Analysts predict the Apple Watch will be the second closely watched feature of the event. Apple is expected to revamp the wearable, released last year, with a faster processor and a GPS chip, enabling users to track runs and other workouts without their phones. Most analysts believe sales of Apple’s watch - which the company has not disclosed - have not yet justified the fanfare. Starting at $299, well above many other wearables on the market, the most meaningful change Apple can make is a price cut, Bajarin said. “This category is very price sensitive,” he said. Apple is “not there yet.”   (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

"2017-01-03",0,"NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - New York City remained the top choice this year among foreign investors in commercial real estate while Washington fell to No. 15 as a global destination and dropped from the top five U.S. cities for the first time, a survey showed. New York is in its seventh year as the prime U.S. city for foreign investors, and its third year as the top global city, members of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE) indicated in the survey. In the decade up to 2012, Washington never fell below No. 4 among global cities surveyed and was the top choice in 2003, 2004 and 2008, the association said. The best Washington has mustered since 2013 was eighth place, according to AFIRE, whose members are among the largest international property investors in the world with an estimated $2 trillion in real estate assets under management. Washington is a good place to invest because the government provides a stable environment, said James Fetgatter, AFIRE’s chief executive. But few investment opportunities, high valuations and lack of a tech industry - a major jobs driver - has hindered the U.S. capital, he said. Germany was second behind the United States among countries that provide the most stable and secure real estate investments, according to the survey. Among developing countries considered for real estate acquisitions, China was first, followed by Mexico and Brazil. Ninety-five percent of respondents to the survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2016 by the James A. Graaskamp Center for Real Estate at the Wisconsin School of Business, said they would increase or maintain their level of U.S. investment. But pessimism about the U.S. market increased to one-third from 8 percent last year. A new U.S. administration and rising interest rates have stirred investor caution, Fetgatter said. Industrial real estate, sparked by the demand for warehouses as online shopping booms, was the top choice of property types, followed by multifamily apartments, AFIRE said. About 100 AFIRE members took the survey, Fetgatter said. The association has about 200 members, equally divided between foreign and U.S. entities. U.S. companies did not respond to certain questions about investing in the United States, he said. "

"2016-10-07",-8,"Friday’s decision was made by the full slate of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February.  The three-judge panel did not follow U.S. Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  The appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California, which ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission.  Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday’s decision upholds that award.  The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday.  James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday’s ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law.  “But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward - and it’s a big win for Apple.” The case is Apple Inc v.

"2016-12-19",-4,"Shifting public perception has an effect. Customer dissatisfaction could keep multinationals from overly-aggressive minimisation of tax bills in future. But without clear rules, companies are currently engaging in a bizarre guessing game over what might constitute fair. Trump could deliver more lasting reforms. The United States’ high corporation tax rate of 35 percent and an exemption for foreign profits are a big cause and symptom of the current distortions: U.S. firms have an estimated $2.5 trillion stashed abroad, according to forecaster Capital Economics. The incoming president wants to slash the headline level to a more competitive level and make it less costly for companies to repatriate their cash. Other changes would be needed. Maarten de Wilde, an academic at Erasmus University Rotterdam, lists three: treat all companies as one entity, no matter how many countries it operates in; grant tax breaks for equity investment to match those for debt; and tax revenue instead of profit.

The decision comes amidst a coordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The ruling against Apple has pushed the issue into the limelight and raised the risk of significant push-back from the United States, analysts say, where some lawmakers are saying the result represents a European encroachment on the U.S. potential tax base. In separate comments to Reuters on the sidelines of the G20 on Saturday, Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD Center for Tax Policy and Administration, called Apple’s tax planning “outrageous” but, like Juncker, said the decision was based on enforcing current regulations. Saint-Amans said he believed it would be unlikely to serve as a precedent for enforcement on future income earned by multinationals. Juncker’s remarks appeared designed to reassure U.S. lawmakers, who have bickered for years over the treatment of off-shore income but now fear that the European Commission move would mean more profits earned by U.S. corporations flowing into European tax coffers. “This is not a decision against the United States of America,” said Juncker.

"2016-07-27",1,"Revenue from the business rose 19 percent to about $6 billion for the third quarter, eclipsing sales of iPads and Mac computers for the second consecutive quarter to rank as Apple’s second-largest unit after iPhones. Apple's shares rose as much as 8 percent to $104.35 on Wednesday - its biggest percentage gain since April 2014 - adding roughly $42 billion to its market cap. The stock was the biggest boost to all three major indexes .SPX .DJI .IXIC. Apple’s shares closed up 6.6 percent at $103.03 on Wednesday.  The company on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected iPhone sales, though they declined for the second straight quarter. As iPhone sales level off, Apple can utilize its existing base of users to wring more money out of its higher-margin services business, several analysts said. With 1 billion devices in the hands of consumers, the size of Apple’s installed base suggests it has plenty of room to grow in services. Services also promise a recurring revenue stream, unlike hardware sales. “The growing iPhone installed base could enable Apple to grow its higher-margin services business through additional iTunes, apps and software sales, as well as through services such as Apple Pay and Apple streaming music service,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said. At least six analysts raised their price targets on Apple’s stock. Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt raised his rating to “outperform” from “market perform” and initiated a $129 target. The median price target on the stock is $120. App Store sales were a bright spot in Apple’s third quarter, growing a record 37 percent, with most revenue coming from purchases of games. Last week, brokerage Needham & Co estimated that Apple could get $3 billion in revenue from the Pokemon Go craze in the next one to two years as gamers buy “PokeCoins” from the App Store. As more apps in other categories such as fitness, autos, home automation and education are developed, Apple stands to be a “prime beneficiary,” said Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter. “The App Store is, and we suspect will remain, the fastest-growing and highest-margin (Apple) business for the foreseeable future,” said Schachter, who expects services revenue to hit $27.62 billion in 2017.  Services revenue, at 14 percent of total revenue in the third quarter, still pales in comparison with iPhone sales, which contribute about two-thirds. Apple also faces intense competition from music service Spotify and cloud storage rivals Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O)  and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), as well as map makers that have won large audiences among iPhone users, even when Apple offers its own products. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster cut his price target to $151 from $153, reflecting a slightly lower profit estimate for 2017. “Some of the true value in services may always go unrealized given that major businesses within other large Internet companies, like AWS in Amazon, Instagram/Oculus in Facebook, and YouTube in Google, are not fully appreciated in terms of value by investors,” he said.

The unveiling of the service, the kick-off to the week-long Worldwide Developers Conference, also included the announcement of an upgraded operating system for Apple’s watch that will let developers create speedier “native” apps that rely less on the iPhone. Apple said that “El Capitan” will be the name of the next version of OS X for its Macs. It disclosed that the next version of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, called iOS 9, will come out this fall and detailed the continued expansion of Apple Pay, which will launch in the United Kingdom next month. Apple’s music service will enable artists to share songs directly with fans, include a global 24/7 radio station named Beats 1 and stream music from the entire iTunes catalogue. Apple Music follows similar streaming services from Spotify, which streams music from record labels and media companies, Pandora, a self-described personalized radio station and others.  Apple Music’s $9.99-a-month price takes effect after a three-month free subscription period. The company is also offering what it calls a “family plan” for $14.99 a month for up to six family members. The success of Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s first new product, the Watch, will likely hinge on a compelling collection of apps. But early apps for the timepiece have been tied to the iPhone, placing limits on what developers could do. “This will be a big deal in creating a much more useful set of apps for the Watch,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, explaining that apps did not always run smoothly when tethered to the iPhone. “Watch apps could feel slow and unresponsive at times.” The company also unveiled new details about its Apple Pay service, saying it was already supported by more than 2,500 banks and will surpass 1 million locations accepting it next month. In a related move, Apple said it would rename Passbook, its app for credit and debit cards and boarding passes, to Wallet. "
"2016-09-02",-19,"* Commission argues Ireland gave secret state aid * Court could be swayed by member states’ views-lawyers * Apple’s tax bill could be reduced by court By Tom Bergin LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will appeal the European Commission’s ruling that his company received an unlawful 13 billion euro ($14.5 billion) subsidy when Ireland gave it preferential tax deals and that he was confident the decision would be reversed. But over a dozen lawyers, including three advising companies on appeals, told Reuters it was impossible to predict how EU courts would rule in an area that has not been tested before. State aid cases have up until now centered on targeted tax laws that countries introduce with an obvious aim of attracting investment and jobs by reduced tax bills. In the Apple case, and several others, the Commission has been investigating whether member countries’ tax authorities were secretly giving tax breaks by being too generous in their application of accepted tax principles. The Commission believes some member states allowed companies to shift profits into untaxed subsidiaries by approving inappropriate transfer prices -- the prices subsidiaries of multinational companies charge each other for intra-group transactions. Most experts said the EU judges dealing with any Apple appeal to overturn the ruling would be focused on whether the European Commission has strayed too far into dictating national tax policy by rejecting Ireland’s view of transfer pricing. “What Apple and Ireland have done sounds really outrageous but the last word has not been spoken as to whether the Commission can use transfer pricing rules to identify what a subsidy is,” said Herwig Hofmann, Professor of law at the University of Luxembourg. “There’s a good argument to be made that if you want to do that, actually you have to harmonize tax laws and you don’t have the power to do that.” EU law says only governments can approve a harmonization of tax systems. The Commission has also been investigating tax transfer pricing at Fiat, McDonald‘s, Starbucks and Amazon.com Inc. The companies and the countries which gave the rulings all deny special treatment was given and have launched, or are considering, legal appeals. “There’s nothing that I have seen in any of the cases that have been taken by the European Commission that suggests there is selective application of the rules,” Tim Wach, Global Managing Director at international tax advisors Taxand. However, other lawyers note that Apple’s unusual tax structure - involving companies which are tax resident nowhere - means its tax rulings are unlikely to have many close comparators. And the rulings lead to a less than 1 percent tax rate -- something most other companies don’t enjoy. “If I had to bet my dollar on something here, I think Apple could have a hard time overturning the selectivity argument,” said Georg Berrisch, a partner at Baker Botts in Brussels. Last year, the European Commission published a list of six tax rulings and 59 “measures similar in nature or effect” since 1991, which it had challenged on the basis of state aid rules. It was successful in almost all cases. Officials say these show its current actions are in line with previous precedents. Many experts in the field disagree and last week the U.S. Treasury issued a detailed paper which assessed earlier cases and said “in none of the 65 cases involving State aid nor in any other cases examined by the U.S. Treasury Department, did the Commission challenge how a Member State tax authority applied its own transfer pricing rules in granting a specific ruling.” The court usually backs the Commission, but lawyers say it sometimes disagrees in state aid cases where it usually comes up against countries. The Irish government is still considering whether to launch its own separate appeal. Some lawyers say ECJ judges are influenced by political considerations and that if the Commission’s rulings prompt a major spat with the United States and member states don’t support the Commission, the court may hesitate to enforce a tax demand of up to 13 billion euros plus interest. So far, France and Germany have voiced support for the Apple ruling. The UK, which has voted to leave the bloc, filed a submission in support of the Commission’s case against Fiat, according to lawyers involved in the case. The UK declined comment. A spokeswoman for the court said political considerations do not come into its decisions. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager agreed. “I don’t think the courts will hear any kind of political opinions or feelings or what’s in your stomach or whatever. They want the facts of the case,” she said. The ECJ could decide the Commission is allowed to challenge transfer pricing but knock back the Commission’s methodology for calculating Apple’s bill. That would leave the door open to a smaller tax demand being levied. “The amount isn’t set in stone at all, I think this figurehead of 13 billion, that is yet to be analyzed in detail,” Hofmann said. If the court backs the Commission, the executive would theoretically be free to challenge hundreds of other complex tax arrangements used, mainly by U.S. companies, to minimize taxes on European sales. A Reuters investigation in 2013 showed that at least 74 percent of the 50 biggest U.S. technology companies, including Google and Facebook, use practices similar to Apple’s to reduce their tax bills. here Ireland is now supposed to calculate exactly how much Apple owes, which is typically paid ahead of an appeal, using the Commission’s methodology. However, a quirk of the Apple ruling may delay this. The Commission said other EU countries could claim some of the 13 billion euros by re-assessing the income of Apple subsidiaries on their territories. Apple’s appeal will first be to the EU’s General Court, which will take two to three years to rule, lawyers say. A likely appeal to the ECJ could take another two years. In meantime, lawyers will be watching more advanced cases. Denis Waelbroeck, of law firm Ashurst in Brussels, who is advising Luxembourg on its appeal in the FIAT case, said the General Court could give a ruling on that next March. “Whatever outcome we get will influence Apple,” he said.

However, since Ireland didn’t deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish “branch.” Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States. Apple’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, told reporters on Tuesday that the assertion that Apple doesn’t pay taxes anywhere on much of its profits is “simply wrong.” “These are profits that are taxed in the United States, and for anybody that understands the U.S. worldwide tax system, this is very easy to understand,” Maestri said. “We actually accrue those tax liabilities on our balance sheet on an ongoing basis and we’ve done it consistently over the years.”  Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple’s Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The United States could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents. “If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few ... so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States,” Vestager said. Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed.  She declined to discuss which other companies’ affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon (AMZN.O) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) in Luxembourg.  She said that since being alerted to Apple’s methods and other cases by a U.S. Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Apple’s Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism. While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample. "
"2015-09-09",-2,"When Apple executives take the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, investors will be scrutinizing their plans for the next generation of the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of the company’s $49.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. Apple is widely expected to keep the size of the phones the same but upgrade it with an improved camera and Force Touch, a display technology that responds differently depending on how hard users press their screens. A year after Apple rolled out iPhones with larger screens, touching off a frenzy of sales that saw revenue in the most recent quarter increase 32.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago, the latest upgrades may leave some investors and consumers underwhelmed. “It’s getting harder and harder for Apple to compete against itself,” said analyst Bob O‘Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple shares closed at $112.31 on Tuesday and are up 14 percent over the last year, although they are down nearly 12 percent in the last three months. Fortunately for Apple, most consumers buy smartphones under a two-year upgrade cycle, meaning the company will still likely scoop up a lot of sales, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The key point of reference is not how the new phone compares to the iPhone 6, it’s how it compares to the iPhone 5s,” he said. Another likely focus of the event is Apple TV, a set-top box that has seen few significant updates since its release in 2007. Although Apple has yet to hammer out deals for a long-awaited television service, analysts say the company is poised to overhaul the hockey-puck-sized device. Expected updates include an App Store and a new user interface that allows users to make requests through the Siri digital assistant and search for specific programs and movies across apps. The company may also discuss the device’s role as a hub for gaming. Nearly 20 percent of U.S. broadband households own at least one streaming media player, and Apple has a long way to go in the market, according to data from research firm Parks Associates. Roku is the leader in streaming media boxes, accounting for 34 percent of all streaming devices sold in the United States in 2014, according to data from research firm Parks Associates. Google Inc’s Chromecast and Amazon.com Inc’s  Fire TV were next. The Apple TV box came in fourth. “It’s important that (Apple) come out and really get up to date and potentially eclipse some of the other living room devices out there,” Moorhead said. Apple is also expected to pay some attention to its iPad line, rolling out a larger tablet. Amid slumping sales, Apple has tried to push the iPad into the enterprise market, and a gadget with a bigger screen may appeal to some professionals seeking to swap out their laptops for tablets, analysts say. But any boost from the enterprise will probably not be enough to offset consumers’ waning interest in the device, O‘Donnell said. “It’s not going to change the arc of the iPad,” he said.

"2016-09-02",-13,"Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating the U.S. tech giant’s Irish tax affairs in 2014. But at an earlier cabinet meeting on Wednesday he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling that Apple must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in tax to Dublin. The government has said a decision whether to challenge European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s ruling - in which she said Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid - would be made at Friday’s cabinet meeting, which is scheduled to start at 1000 GMT. However, the Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, has said it wants its senior coalition partners to commit to reviewing how tax is collected from Ireland’s large cluster of multinational companies before it considers a  challenge. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal. Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Another independent minister, unaligned to Alliance, also asked to delay a decision when Noonan sought approval on Wednesday. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down a tax windfall equivalent to what it spent last year funding the struggling health service, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. But others worry a failure to appeal could put in jeopardy the one in 10 jobs provided by multinationals, who are attracted  to Ireland by the country’s low corporate tax regime. Apple has already said it will appeal the ruling, and its chief executive Tim Cook warned on Thursday that if the Dublin government did not join it, this would send the wrong message to business in a country whose economic model depends in part on companies like his. “The Apple ruling has brought some reputational damage to Ireland. There is no doubt about that. To restore this reputation, the Irish government has little choice but to appeal,” said Dermot O‘Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers.

"2015-09-09",4,"But as it zeroes in on the living room, Apple will face fierce competition from firms such as Amazon and Roku, whose products offer many of the Apple TV’s features at lower price. The new Apple set top boxes go on sale at the end of October starting at $149.  The iPhone maker has already changed TV viewing, making it easier to watch shows almost anywhere. But the living room remains a coveted destination for tech companies as the site where consumers end their days and gather with their families.   “The holy grail” is how Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a consumer research firm, described it. Apple is rolling out Apple TV as investors call for the company to lessen its dependence on the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of its sales in the most recent quarter. Apple TV could become a significant source of profit for the company, analysts say, but revenue from programming and services will be key. Wednesday’s announcement did not include an Apple streaming TV service that bundles cable channels, which industry executives say the company is exploring.  Analyzing the 2012 model of Apple TV, technology research firm IHS estimated that the $99 gadget cost $66.15 to make, making its margins considerably lower than other Apple products. The new box has yet to be analyzed, but Apple’s business model is likely the same, said analyst Kevin Keller of IHS. “It’s a content-driven model,” he said. The new App Store opens what had been a mostly closed environment to thousands of developers, said Jason Krikorian, general partner at DCM Ventures and a co-founder of Sling Media, creator of the Slingbox streaming media device. “If Hollywood’s brightest minds can be put toward delivering content on the many Apple-controlled screens in someone’s home, I think they can make new television viewing experiences,” he said. Roku also boasts an open platform for developers. But with its loyal base of users, Apple has an edge, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “The key will be helping developers get off the ground quickly,” he said, and then convincing consumers to buy the TV based on the apps available for it. The new Apple TV tackles one of the most frustrating parts of modern TV viewing – finding what to watch. The Siri voice feature lets people search with simple commands such as “find movies with Jason Bateman,” based on a demonstration at Wednesday’s event.  But Apple is playing catch up in this area. Voice search is already available on the competing Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming boxes and Comcast Corp’s X1 platform for pay TV subscribers. And none is yet truly universal in searching all major types of TV content. Apple’s search will initially be limited to content on iTunes and apps from HBO, Showtime, Netflix and Hulu, said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services. The Apple TV will have a special focus on games, aiming to win over casual players as the iPhone has. Apple TV will run the same operating system as the iPad and iPhone, making it easy for developers to bring their games to the device. But Apple will need more than quantity, said Barbara Kraus, an industry analyst at Parks Associates. “They are going to have to get games that have buzz,” she said. And Apple TV’s greatest rival may be the traditional television set, which remains the dominant media platform, though usage of streaming devices such as set-top boxes and gaming consoles is on the rise among all age groups, according to Nielsen data. Use is highest among the millennial generation of 18- to 34-year-olds. About 30 percent of millennials use a streaming device per quarter, Nielsen data show, and they use it for about 23 days on average for 2.5 hours per day. Smart TV holdouts might find themselves entranced by Apple TV if they give the gadget a chance, Milanesi predicted.    “It draws you in,” she said. "
"2015-03-08",-3,"With the expected launch next month of the Apple Watch, the company’s first new product in five years, Apple will be stepping into new territory. To conquer the marketplace, the watch will have to appeal not only as a gadget but as a fashion statement, a fact tacitly acknowledged by Apple’s decision to launch its advertising campaign with a 12-page insert in the March issue of Vogue. The company isn’t talking about plans for marketing the Apple Watch in advance of it’s much-touted “Spring Forward” event on Monday, but it clearly intends to keep a tight grip on initial sales and distribution, leaving many retailers guessing about when -- or if -- they’ll be able to sell it. Sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that Best Buy Co Inc, one of the largest sellers of Apple products, may not get the watch at launch time, though the company wouldn’t comment on the situation. Other large retailers, including Macy‘s, Saks 5th Avenue, Bloomingdales and Barney’s said they had no immediate plans to carry the watch. Target and Nordstrom,along with all the major phone carriers, declined to comment on their plans, though a source with knowledge of the situation said Nordstrom has engaged in discussions with Apple. “Apple is being cautious. There are too many unknowns around how this product will perform,” said Van Baker, research vice-president, technology research firm Gartner Inc. That might mean restricting initial sales to company stores, where Apple has complete control over the experience and staff can be specially trained to sell the watch, Baker said. Apple’s Cook seems very aware of the challenge. The Telegraph, which sent a reporter with the CEO to the company’s Covent Garden store, reported that he explained to the staff that selling the watch might require “tweaking the experience in the store.” In the absence of hard information about what the tweaks might look like, speculation has been intense. The Washington Post last week suggested that Apple might add carpeting and mirrors and change store lighting to enhance the watch-buying experience. Media outlets and Websites have also posited that the watch will be offered at special pop-up stores installed at luxury retailers such as Selfridges in London and Colette in Paris. Apple hosted a private event at Colette last September, at which guests were able to try on the watch, but a spokesman for Colette declined to comment on whether the store would carry it. Until now, wearable gadgets have not been big sellers for technology companies. Rival products such as Samsung’s Gear watches have sold poorly. Apple hopes to change that, but it is still a big if whether the watch will appeal to buyers seeking a fashion accessory, especially if it needs to be upgraded every few years like Apple’s phones, tablets and computers. “It could do wonders for the watch market if it means people might wear watches again, but realistically, there are a lot of doubts,” said Eric Wilson, fashion news director of InStyle. “Fashion customers are more skeptical than anyone, so Apple has picked a tough crowd.”   (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Piya Sinha Roy in Los Angeles, Additional reporting by Nathan Layne in Chicago, Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco and Malathi Nayak in New York, Editing by Dina Kyriakidou and Sue Horton)"

The iPhone maker has struck deals recently with China's big four state-run banks, the newspaper reported late Monday, citing people familiar with the discussions. (on.wsj.com/1LwSf8O) When launched, Apple Pay will mainly compete with Alipay, the online payment platform run by Alibaba Holding Group Ltd  affiliate Ant Financial, and UnionPay Co, a state-controlled consortium that has a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country.

"2012-02-27",-14,"“The licensing terms offered by Apple sufficiently addresses Motorola’s interests,” the higher regional court in Karlsruhe, Germany, said on Monday. Its decision was a preliminary assessment in an ongoing appeals process. Apple and Motorola -- which Google is in the process of acquiring -- are engaged in global patent litigation, part of a broader legal fight over the smartphone market, with billions of dollars at stake. Motorola won a temporary injunction in a Mannheim court in December that forced Apple to stop the sale of iPhone 3G and 4 models and 3G/UMTS-based iPads -- which Motorola said infringed some of its patents -- on its German online store. Apple has been fighting the injunction since then, saying Motorola should allow it to use its patented technology because companies in the mobile device sector cannot get around using it if they want to remain competitive. Motorola has said it has negotiated with Apple and offered it “reasonable licensing terms and conditions since 2007”. The Karlsruhe court said Apple has now amended its counter-offer for terms twice to have the injunction overturned. “At the current stage, which only allows a summary assessment of the two sides’ arguments, it is to be assumed that Motorola would be in breach of its obligations under anti-trust legislation if it continued to demand that Apple does not sell the iPhone and iPad,” the court said. In a separate dispute between the two companies, Apple was forced last week to deactivate “push” notification features for mobile users of its iCloud and MobileMe services in Germany, after an injunction in favour of Motorola. It is also locked in disputes over mobile patent infringement with other companies including Samsung Electronics  and HTC, in several countries."
"2016-04-28",2,"The latest partnership extends the service to ANZ customers and represents the culmination of months of talks with the bank and three bigger peers. Of the four, ANZ and Westpac Banking Corp have already agreed to support rival Android Pay from Alphabet Inc unit Google. Collectively, the four banks account for 80 percent of all credit cards that consumers have linked to mobile payment systems, in a country with a relatively high rate of contactless payment. The partnership also coincides with Apple’s first-ever drop in iPhone sales during a quarter in which services such as apps, music and payment emerged as the firm’s second-largest business. “Our customers ... are much closer to being able to leave their wallets at home,” Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said in an interview. Apple has partnered with a bank widely seen as trailing its three bigger peers in digital technology, a situation ANZ’s new Chief Executive Shayne Elliott has set out to change with Apple Pay, as well as by hiring Google’s Australia managing director. Shares of ANZ rose over 0.5 percent early on Thursday, more than other banks as well as the broader market. For Apple, the partnership is a “coup” as it would increase pressure other banks to follow suit, said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of technology researcher Telsyte.  “The similar forces that drove other numerous banking corporations in say the U.S. or Europe to get onboard will probably start to also kick in Australia as well,” he said. Analyst David Ellis at Morningstar said one partnership does not automatically entail success because the big four banks have such dominance over payment systems. “It’s a different market here in Australia to the U.S. and to other global economies ... but who knows,” he said. “iPhones have the highest market share in Australia of smartphones, so the banks won’t want their customers being put at any disadvantage to competitors within their peer group.” "

A string of controversies over corporate taxation had already prompted Ireland to begin phasing out the tax structure used by Apple.   “The Commission’s decision has been reported around the world, it’s a global story and some people obviously won’t get past the headline. That’s problematic for Ireland,” said Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the state agency in charge of attracting foreign direct investment.  “When IDA tries to attract companies in, those companies work on the basis that the taxation system is what is laid down in law. The Commission decision calls into question whether that is the case and that’s unhelpful, not just for Ireland.” Shanahan, who began the damage limitation with a series of media interviews in London within hours of the ruling, will use Brexit-related trade missions to London, New York and the U.S. west coast to provide clarity for investors in the coming weeks. Ireland is hoping for a bonus from Britain’s June vote to leave the EU, which leaves it as the only English-speaking country offering a base in the euro zone and a future in the bloc. It had more than 35 concrete enquiries by the end of last month from financial groups looking at setting up a base or expanding in Ireland as a result of the Brexit referendum. Shanahan, who oversees the strategy responsible for around 190,000 jobs or almost one in every 10 Irish workers, said the huge increase in inquiries has continued and he did not see the Commission’s ruling damaging those prospects.   On Wednesday, Russian antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab announced the opening of its first European research and development center in Dublin, where it will create 50 jobs by 2018, the fifth such announcement since last week’s Apple ruling that has included new investments from Coca Cola (KO.N) and wearable fitness device maker Fitbit Inc (FIT.N). Ireland moved to shut down the “Double Irish” tax loophole in 2013 following damning criticism from a U.S. Senate committee investigation by making it illegal for a company registered in Ireland to have no tax domicile anywhere.  “Awareness at a board level regarding international tax structures and associated tax and reputational risk grew on the back of that,” said Kevin Doyle, international tax partner at BDO, referring also to an investigative reporting series that heightened the international debate on corporate tax avoidance. “The initial conversations with potential FDI companies has evolved over the last number of years. With new set ups, there’s less and less discussion about implementing aggressive tax structuring.”  Ireland has been here before. It launched a diplomatic offensive in 2013 to reject the U.S. senators’ accusations that it acted as a tax haven for companies like Apple, issuing its embassies from Beijing to Buenos Aires with rebuttal points. The strategy worked. The IDA continued to add jobs in 2014 and posted a record year in 2015, meaning foreign multinationals now employ over 20 percent more workers than they did a decade ago, before the ‘Celtic Tiger’ boom gave way to a spectacular economic bust.      A similar response will be mounted this time, to fight back against “detractors who paint a cartoonish and negative image of Ireland”, as Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Wednesday.  Officials used the hosting of an American Football game in Dublin last week to press their case with the heads of Coca Cola and State Street while ambassadors from over 80 countries, also in Dublin for a meeting on Brexit, were briefed by Noonan.  “When we talk about damage to the reputation, if we step back, yes, it looks very bad,” said Eoghan Murphy, the junior minister leading the charge in trying to make sure whatever business leaves Britain’s financial center ends up in Ireland. “But when we actually talk to the different sectors, they understand what’s happening, they understand the overreach by the Commission. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to go out and robustly defend ourselves, and we will.” "
"2016-09-01",-17,"Washington has lined up with the tech giant, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. But in Ireland itself, the government and public opinion are divided over whether to take the windfall - which would fund the country’s health system for a year - or reject it in the hope of maintaining a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals, creating jobs. A group of independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the minority coalition’s survival, called for a review of how tax is collected from multinationals. Their reluctance to back a call for an appeal by the country’s finance minister has cast doubt on whether Ireland will challenge Vestager’s decision. Apple has said it will appeal the ruling which Cook attacked in an interview with the Irish Independent. “No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable,” the newspaper quoted him saying. “It’s total political crap.” Vestager has questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed the iPhone maker to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. She said on Thursday that the calculations were based on data provided by Apple itself and evidence presented during hearings on Apple tax issues in the United States. “This is a decision based on the facts of the case,” she told a news conference.  The battle lines are forming on both sides of the Atlantic. In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager’s view that Apple’s Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. “The European Commission is doing its job,” he told a news conference. “It’s normal to make Apple pay normal taxes.”  German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the Commission on Tuesday. Austria also welcomed the ruling but Britain - which voted in June to leave the EU - has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the Commission. “DOING THE WRONG THING” Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014.  However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation due to misgivings among the five-strong Independent Alliance group of lawmakers.  “I don’t think Apple have paid sufficient tax. I don’t think they’ve been illegal in what they’ve done, it’s the tax system as it’s set up,” said Alliance member John Halligan, a junior minister who does not sit at cabinet. After five hours of discussion, the cabinet adjourned discussion of an appeal until Friday when the government said a decision would be made. Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. On the streets of Dublin, some argued Ireland had to keep drawing foreign investors with low tax rates to provide jobs. But others said the government should drop the idea of appealing the decision and take the money. “They are doing the wrong thing. They don’t care about the normal people,” said Louise O‘Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. “The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive.” O‘Reilly’s mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of 1,050 euros ($1,170), a higher rate than the EU said Apple’s main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. By contrast, Cook estimated Apple’s average annual tax on its global profits at 26 percent. “They just picked a number from I don’t know where,” he said. But in another interview he promised to boost tax payments by repatriating billions of dollars in global profits to the United States next year.  Apple would fight with Ireland to overturn the ruling - by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU - which he said had “no basis in law or in fact”. “DOING THE RIGHT THING” Cook played down the possibility of the government failing to appeal the decision.  “The future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty,” he told RTE radio. “I‘m pretty confident that the government will do the right thing.”  In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticized the ruling. “I have been concerned that it reflected an attempt to reach into the U.S. tax base to tax income that ought to be taxed in the United States,” he said on Wednesday. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Cook said part of the company’s 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. ($1 = 0.8969 euros) "
"2015-04-28",2,"Apple beat Wall Street’s revenue and profit forecasts on Monday as it sold more iPhones in China than the United States for the first time. The most valuable publicly traded U.S. company also raised its quarterly dividend by 11 percent to 52 cents per share and boosted its share buyback program to $140 billion from $90 billion. Icahn, who has been vocal about his belief that Apple is undervalued, has urged the company’s board to buy back more shares using its huge cash pile. He has also pledged to keep his own stock out of any repurchase. The 79-year-old, one of Apple’s top 10 investors, said in February that Apple stock should be trading at $216. Apple’s shares were marginally down at $132.62 by midday. The stock had fallen as much as 2.3 percent earlier in the day. "
"2015-06-08",2,"“The Apple brand speaks for itself and it will have an earthquake-like impact on the industry,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Markets. “Given the gold standard brand, given Apple’s breadth and awareness, it’s more important what Apple is doing strategically than moving the needle financially.”  Offering few surprises to what had been expected, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares did not react strongly, closing down less than 1 percent at $127.80. “The only thing that is going to move Apple stock is iPhone sales and there wasn’t enough news to be a mover in profitability,” said Michael Yoshikami, the chief executive officer of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California. The unveiling of the service, the kick-off to the week-long Worldwide Developers Conference, also included the announcement of an upgraded operating system for Apple’s watch that will let developers create speedier “native” apps that rely less on the iPhone. Apple said that “El Capitan” will be the name of the next version of OS X for its Macs. It disclosed that the next version of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, called iOS 9, will come out this fall and detailed the continued expansion of Apple Pay, which will launch in the United Kingdom next month. Apple’s music service will enable artists to share songs directly with fans, include a global 24/7 radio station named Beats 1 and stream music from the entire iTunes catalogue. Apple Music follows similar streaming services from Spotify, which streams music from record labels and media companies, Pandora, a self-described personalized radio station and others.  Apple Music’s $9.99-a-month price takes effect after a three-month free subscription period. The company is also offering what it calls a “family plan” for $14.99 a month for up to six family members. The success of Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s first new product, the Watch, will likely hinge on a compelling collection of apps. But early apps for the timepiece have been tied to the iPhone, placing limits on what developers could do. “This will be a big deal in creating a much more useful set of apps for the Watch,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, explaining that apps did not always run smoothly when tethered to the iPhone. “Watch apps could feel slow and unresponsive at times.” The company also unveiled new details about its Apple Pay service, saying it was already supported by more than 2,500 banks and will surpass 1 million locations accepting it next month. In a related move, Apple said it would rename Passbook, its app for credit and debit cards and boarding passes, to Wallet. "
"2016-09-06",-11,"The muted online anticipation for the iPhone 7 underlines the challenge Apple faces to revive growth in China, where an economic slowdown has slammed the brakes on what was once touted as the firm’s next big growth engine. Apple’s Greater China sales dropped by a third in April-June, albeit after more than doubling a year earlier, and revenue was down by more than a quarter to $8.8 billion - around a fifth of its total sales. Its 7.8 percent market share ranked fifth in China, trailing local vendors Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], OPPO and Vivo, which together accounted for 47 percent, according to IDC data. The California-based company’s online stores for iBooks and movies was also closed in China after Beijing imposed strict curbs in March on online publishing, and Apple has been on the losing side of intellectual property battles here. Beijing student Wang Yue, 23, said she was in no hurry to buy an iPhone 7. “I‘m looking forward to the launch, but I won’t rush to buy anything,” Wang, who uses an iPhone 6S that was launched last year, told Reuters. “I want to know what new functions it’s got. My feeling is there are no real major changes from the 6S, so I think I’ll hold off for a while.” Apple is widely anticipated to unveil the new iPhone 7 at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday. The company, which doesn’t give a regional breakdown for its iPhone sales, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Among half a dozen consumers Reuters spoke to most said they would first check out the new phone’s functions or wait for the price to drop. Only one planned to definitely buy any new model. “The word among consumers is the updates are not going to be revolutionary, but smaller changes,” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based director at China Market Research Group, who described current consumer interest in China as “muted”. China sales of the iPhone 6 soared in the first quarter of last year, helping drive up Apple’s China revenues by 71 percent. A year later, weaker sales of the 6S contributed to the company’s first global decline in iPhone sales and first revenue drop in 13 years - though globally the 6S was the top-selling smartphone in April-June, according to Strategy Analytics. The research firm estimates iPhone shipments in China will decline 20 percent in the second half of this year to 21 million from a year ago. “Apple is struggling with consumer ‘iPhone fatigue’ in China, while competition from Huawei, Oppo and others remains fierce,” said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. Weibo chatter in the run-up to the iPhone 7 launch has, however, topped levels seen ahead of last year’s 6S launch. Some Chinese shoppers are even already eyeing a potential iPhone 8 model that could be launched with more significant changes next year, the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. “Because it’s just one year, lots of people are choosing to wait for the iPhone 8,” said Wang Bo, a finance worker in his thirties at a securities firm in Shanghai. “The changes with the 8 will be much bigger, which I think will be a drag on sales of the new phone this year.” Wang, who uses both an iPhone 6S and a Huawei P9, said he plans to buy this year’s new iPhone when it’s released in China. But convincing other shoppers in China - and the United States - to replace their smartphone is a tougher sell today than in 2014, when many Chinese were buying an iPhone for the first time. Concerns that Apple has hit ""peak iPhone"" have buffeted the firm's shares this year, with the stock price up just 2.35 percent, lagging the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX. “The biggest thing that’s changed since 2014 is that the iPhone is widely available,” said Ben Thompson, who analyses the technology sector at Stratechery. “There’s a lot more growth potential when people have their first chance to buy an iPhone, but that potential has now been realized.” "

"2016-09-06",-9,"* Apple expected to launch new iPhone this week * China sales, market share hit by local rivals * Many shoppers still see Apple as top brand By Adam Jourdan and Paul Carsten SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Judging by the volume of online chatter, there’s a lot less buzz in China ahead of this week’s expected launch of the new Apple Inc  iPhone, and people on the street say they’re more likely to “wait and see” what the latest device offers than rush out to buy. Posts on China’s popular Sina Weibo microblogging site show the iPhone 6, which took China by storm in 2014 with its new, larger screen, attracted around 15 times more comments in the month before launch than this year’s model.

GT said it will own and operate the furnaces to produce the sapphire material, but Apple will own the Arizona facility. Under the terms of its supply deal, Apple will give GT a prepayment of about $578 million, which GT will pay back to Apple over five years, starting in 2015, GT said."
"2013-01-08",-2,"Apple could decide not to move forward with the lower-end iPhone, the report noted. The product would represent the first time Apple has diversified its line of smartphones with significantly different models since launching the original iPhone in 2007. The company faces pressure from rival smartphone-makers such as Samsung Electronics Co LTD whose products use Google Inc’s Android operating system. Apple declined to comment on the report. Shares of Apple, which closed Tuesday’s regular trading session at $525.31, are down 25.5 percent from their 52-week high of $705.07 in September. "
"2016-08-30",-17,"The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.”     Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  Apple’s stock fell less than 1 percent. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. “Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple’s tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits,” Vestager told a news conference.   Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission’s aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts.  Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission’s investigation could lead to “material” liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place “some amount of cash” in an escrow account. Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others.  As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax. “I am not persuaded by the reasoning the EU has applied,” said Tim Wach, global managing director at international tax advisers Taxand. “ARTIFICIAL” ARRANGEMENT    The EU’s ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish-registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed. Apple Inc licenses the rights to technology designed in the United States to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia.  Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $22 billion after paying $2 billion to its U.S. parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property. However, the Irish tax authority agreed only 50 million euros of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple’s tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a “head office” that did not have any employees or own any premises. “This ‘head office’ had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter,” the Commission said. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland’s attractiveness for investment he would appeal. “There is no economic basis for this decision. It’s bizarre and it’s an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission,” Noonan said. “They don’t have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments,” he added. Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country’s economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country’s workers. For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules. “The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple’s website. “A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,” he added. U.S. OPPOSITION    The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the U.S. arms of European companies. The paper noted that the EU executive’s tax rulings could cost the U.S. exchequer money.  Under U.S. tax law, Apple’s Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States – something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends. But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission’s approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties. The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally. Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals.  Apple employs 5,500 people in areas such as logistics and distribution in the Irish city of Cork, which has about a quarter of Apple’s Europe-based staff.  The Commission has previously said Apple’s tax treatment had been “motivated by employment considerations.”  Apple has said it paid Ireland’s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri decried the effective tax rate cited by Vestager as ”a completely made-up number. "
"2014-02-10",-2,"Icahn said in a letter to Apple shareholders posted on his website that he was pleased that Apple CEO Tim Cook and the board have exhibited an “opportunistic” and “aggressive” approach to share repurchases. () Apple said last week it repurchased $14 billion of its stock in the two weeks since it reported disappointing first-quarter results. Icahn’s statement comes a day after proxy advisory firm ISS said it recommended that Apple shareholders vote against the activist investor’s share buyback proposal."
"2016-08-30",-19,"The U.S. Treasury said the Commission’s order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel.  A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made “a cheap money grab” for U.S. revenues.  But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple’s taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas. “The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,” he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. “So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance.” For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states’ efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. “Companies are playing one government against another,” he told Reuters.  “The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,” Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe. The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home.    As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), has abused its market power have also fueled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration that Europe is out to punish American success. Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too. “When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,” he said. The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) proposed merger with Allergan Plc (AGN.N) of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called “tax inversions”, by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes.  Pfizer abandoned the merger. "
"2015-07-30",-1,"The device will be launched with its own App Store and a software development kit for app developers, the website said. Apple said it declined to comment on rumors and speculation. The Apple TV has not been refreshed since 2013. The iPhone maker was expected to unveil a new version in June at its annual Word Wide Developers Conference, but it launched the Apple Music streaming service. "
"2016-09-02",-13,"With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid.  However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday.  Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was “little short of bizarre and outrageous”. “How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money,” he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. “This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future,” he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland’s decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU’s General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice.  The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favors challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail’s backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. “The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations,” Earnest said.  “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States.” A number of G20 governments are worried about how  multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

"2015-06-08",2,"“The Apple brand speaks for itself and it will have an earthquake-like impact on the industry,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Markets. “Given the gold standard brand, given Apple’s breadth and awareness, it’s more important what Apple is doing strategically than moving the needle financially.”  Offering few surprises to what had been expected, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares did not react strongly, closing down less than 1 percent at $127.80. “The only thing that is going to move Apple stock is iPhone sales and there wasn’t enough news to be a mover in profitability,” said Michael Yoshikami, the chief executive officer of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California. The unveiling of the service, the kick-off to the week-long Worldwide Developers Conference, also included the announcement of an upgraded operating system for Apple’s watch that will let developers create speedier “native” apps that rely less on the iPhone. Apple said that “El Capitan” will be the name of the next version of OS X for its Macs. It disclosed that the next version of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, called iOS 9, will come out this fall and detailed the continued expansion of Apple Pay, which will launch in the United Kingdom next month. Apple’s music service will enable artists to share songs directly with fans, include a global 24/7 radio station named Beats 1 and stream music from the entire iTunes catalog. Apple Music follows similar streaming services from Spotify, which streams music from record labels and media companies, Pandora, a self-described personalized radio station and others.  The success of Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s first new product, the Watch, will likely hinge on a compelling collection of apps. But early apps for the timepiece have been tied to the iPhone, placing limits on what developers could do. “This will be a big deal in creating a much more useful set of apps for the Watch,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, explaining that apps did not always run smoothly when tethered to the iPhone. “Watch apps could feel slow and unresponsive at times.” The company also unveiled new details about its Apple Pay service, saying it was already supported by more than 2,500 banks and will surpass 1 million locations accepting it next month. In a related move, Apple said it would rename Passbook, its app for credit and debit cards and boarding passes, to Wallet. "
"2015-06-08",4,"Apple Pay will be available in 250,000 locations across the UK when it launches in July, making it more widely available than when it was first introduced in the United States in October, the company said. The payments service allows consumers using the latest Apple phones, tablets and smartwatches to buy goods or services by holding the device up to contactless readers installed by merchants. Apple executives speaking at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco also introduced improvements to Apple Watch and a new streaming music service it will offer worldwide starting on June 30 for $9.99 (6.52 pounds) a month. The consumer electronics giant said eight of the most popular UK banks would support Apple Pay when it opens next month, with more banks to follow in the autumn. It said well-known retailers Boots, the UK pharmacy unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance ; Costa Coffee, a unit of Whitbread ; department store Marks and Spencer  and supermarket Waitrose have all lined up to support Apple Pay. Several major airlines, travel agents, hotels and taxi firms have also signed up, Apple said. Commuters and tourists using the London Underground will be able to swipe their Apple phones at station turnstiles to pay for tickets, Apple said. Already, existing U.S. Apple Pay users visiting London can pay for trips on the Tube, according to officials of the network’s operator, Transport for London. Britain is expected to be fertile territory for Apple Pay. Contactless payments have surged in popularity in recent years, while the U.S. market remains in the early stages of contactless adoption by consumers. Analysts say contactless payments in the UK first caught on with consumers using pay-and-go cards on the Tube. Apple said Apple Pay will be supported by more than 70 percent of credit and debit cards in use in the UK. In separate statements, credit card giants Visa Europe, Mastercard  and American Express confirmed they would support Apple Pay in the UK. MasterCard said it is working with several banks, including HSBC Holdings, RBS/Natwest and Santander , to make their MasterCard credit, debit or prepaid cards work with Apple Pay. Nationwide Building Society also said it would support the Apple payments service. Bank of Scotland, Coutts, Halifax, Lloyds Bank, MBNA, M&S Bank and TSB Bank are among those that will join in autumn. Unlike the consumer electronics business, where Apple regularly releases new computers or phones in dozens of countries at once, there is no such thing as a unified payments market, slowing expansion to further markets  (1 British pound = $1.5339)   (Additional reporting by Julia Love in San Francisco)"
"2015-09-09",4,"But as it zeroes in on the living room, Apple will face fierce competition from firms such as Amazon and Roku, whose products offer many of the Apple TV’s features at lower price. The new Apple set top boxes go on sale at the end of October starting at $149.  The iPhone maker has already changed TV viewing, making it easier to watch shows almost anywhere. But the living room remains a coveted destination for tech companies as the site where consumers end their days and gather with their families.   “The holy grail” is how Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a consumer research firm, described it. Apple is rolling out Apple TV as investors call for the company to lessen its dependence on the iPhone, which drove nearly two-thirds of its sales in the most recent quarter. Apple TV could become a significant source of profit for the company, analysts say, but revenue from programming and services will be key. Wednesday’s announcement did not include an Apple streaming TV service that bundles cable channels, which industry executives say the company is exploring.  Analyzing the 2012 model of Apple TV, technology research firm IHS estimated that the $99 gadget cost $66.15 to make, making its margins considerably lower than other Apple products. The new box has yet to be analyzed, but Apple’s business model is likely the same, said analyst Kevin Keller of IHS. “It’s a content-driven model,” he said. The new App Store opens what had been a mostly closed environment to thousands of developers, said Jason Krikorian, general partner at DCM Ventures and a co-founder of Sling Media, creator of the Slingbox streaming media device. “If Hollywood’s brightest minds can be put toward delivering content on the many Apple-controlled screens in someone’s home, I think they can make new television viewing experiences,” he said. Roku also boasts an open platform for developers. But with its loyal base of users, Apple has an edge, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “The key will be helping developers get off the ground quickly,” he said, and then convincing consumers to buy the TV based on the apps available for it. The new Apple TV tackles one of the most frustrating parts of modern TV viewing – finding what to watch. The Siri voice feature lets people search with simple commands such as “find movies with Jason Bateman,” based on a demonstration at Wednesday’s event.  But Apple is playing catch up in this area. Voice search is already available on the competing Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming boxes and Comcast Corp’s X1 platform for pay TV subscribers. And none is yet truly universal in searching all major types of TV content. Apple’s search will initially be limited to content on iTunes and apps from HBO, Showtime, Netflix and Hulu, said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services. The Apple TV will have a special focus on games, aiming to win over casual players as the iPhone has. Apple TV will run the same operating system as the iPad and iPhone, making it easy for developers to bring their games to the device. But Apple will need more than quantity, said Barbara Kraus, an industry analyst at Parks Associates. “They are going to have to get games that have buzz,” she said. And Apple TV’s greatest rival may be the traditional television set, which remains the dominant media platform, though usage of streaming devices such as set-top boxes and gaming consoles is on the rise among all age groups, according to Nielsen data. Use is highest among the millennial generation of 18- to 34-year-olds. About 30 percent of millennials use a streaming device per quarter, Nielsen data show, and they use it for about 23 days on average for 2.5 hours per day. Smart TV holdouts might find themselves entranced by Apple TV if they give the gadget a chance, Milanesi predicted.    “It draws you in,” she said. "
"2012-06-08",-3,"Apple on Monday is expected to announce its own mapping application, challenging the position of Google Maps as one of the most-valued features on the iPhone. It will unveil closer integration of its iPhone apps and iCloud storage service with all its devices, the latest riposte in its battle with Google’s Android smartphone software. It may promote the latest in Siri, the voice interface that the company thinks can continue to set the iPhone and the iPad apart from the Android pack. And there will likely be a new line of Macintosh laptops too - underscoring the leverage that a full line of hardware products can bring to what is mainly a software war with Google. Apple is looking to differentiate its mobile devices from Google’s Android by further enticing consumers deeper into its app ecosystem, said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Gartner Research. “It’s all about loyalty and basically leveraging the opportunity of selling more to them,” she said. “I don’t think the consumers in the mass market are necessarily tied into the Android ecosystem in the same way that consumers on the Apple side are.” Battling in many arenas, the rivals employ different weapons. Apple’s vise-like grip on its ecosystem - with the closely managed app store and its seamless integration with the hardware - stands in sharp contrast to Google’s free-for-all approach. The open system approach, reminiscent of Microsoft Corp’s hugely successful strategy of creating standard-setting software that runs on a variety of hardware, has allowed Android to capture the market lead in smartphones (albeit with nothing close to Apple’s profit margins). Android has also helped create several potent hardware rivals to Apple. Samsung Electronics’ Android-driven Galaxy SIII is drawing favorable comparisons to iPhone and Amazon.com Inc’s cheaper Kindle Fire is challenging Apple in tablets and digital content. Apple’s expected move to replace Google Maps with its own mapping application is a particularly dramatic example of how the rivalry between the companies has been evolving. Google has invested huge sums in its mapping technology over the years, and about half of its map traffic now comes from iPhones and iPads. Among other things, the traffic from those devices reveals valuable location data that helps improve the mapping service and provides features like real-time traffic reports. Apple has spent three years preparing to take mapping back. It has integrated technology from acquisitions such as 3D mapping company C3 Technologies, Canadian startup Poly9 Group and mapping service Placebase, said ISI analyst Brian Marshall. “As Apple builds out its Siri service, they build out the iCloud infrastructure and more capability into its operating system, location data is going to become important,” said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. “This could help their advertising business too.” While Google executives avoided any comment on the possibility of being ousted as a default service on Apple devices, one executive said the integration with Google’s search engine provides a mapping service that is far more useful than a product that simply uses a ”geocoder. Apple began to use its own geocoder - technology that uses geographic coordinates to create a digital map - for the Google-based maps on its smartphones late last year, a move that was seen as a precursor to Apple using its own map software. Another software upgrade that fans and developers are hoping for is Siri, a popular voice-enabled personal assistant service that Google has yet to match. The service could come out of its beta testing phase and show up on the iPad when Apple unveils iOS6 or the next version of its mobile operating software. Siri, which has been plagued with connectivity and other issues, is still in beta test version. Apple’s global war on Google and Android in the courts is one sign of how seriously it is taking the potential threat. The consumer device giant is seeing limited success, though, in courtrooms for various patent infringement cases it has against Android manufacturers. Apple said this week it is mulling a legal order to stop the U.S. launch of Samsung Galaxy S III phone later this month. Samsung is one of the biggest Android phone manufacturers. In another of the many lawsuits worldwide pitting Apple against Motorola Mobility, now owned by Google, a federal judge canceled a scheduled trial as neither could prove damages. That decision particularly hurts Apple because the iPhone maker was seeking an injunction barring the sale of Android products, said Brian Love, a professor at Stanford Law School. “The Android side is likely thrilled to simply have the case go away,” Love said. Apple declined to comment on the case. The redesigned MacBook laptops to hit the stage next week are expected to include high-definition screens and Intel Corp’s Ivy Bridge cutting-edge processors. Some even expect the iPad’s “retina” display to show up on the MacBook line. This would be Apple’s first big redesign of the MacBook Pro since mid-2009. With the new lineup, it hopes to fend off budding competition from rival manufacturers who are pushing a spate of new, thinner laptops called “Ultrabooks.” Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system that runs on tablet computers as well as PCs, will bolster PC makers’ ability to offer premier computers rivaling Apple’s MacBook line. Already, about 20 touch-enabled ultrabook designs with various styles of foldable, detachable or sliding keyboards running the new Windows 8 system are in the pipeline. The MacBook line generated 13 percent, or about $5 billion, of Apple’s fiscal second-quarter revenue. Unit sales of the aging lineup were up 7 percent from the previous year but were down 23 percent sequentially. Whatever the case, Apple fans and partners can look forward to a fairly action-packed week. “Apple is very serious about getting far in front of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks,” said Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes. But “software and services will be the focus, with major enhancements to Maps, iCloud and Siri, which developers and users can take advantage of.” "
