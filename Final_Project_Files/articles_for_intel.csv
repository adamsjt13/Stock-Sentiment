2017-09-18,5,"Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel built “a custom piece of silicon” that fit Waymo’s sensor fusion needs and tapped Intel’s processing power.   “Over time we’ll both learn we can bring more of the software ... down onto the silicon, because you get performance, cost and power,” Krzanich said. “There will be a regular cadence of new innovation and new silicon that comes out. That’s really what we both get out of this.”  Intel, which announced the $15 billion acquisition of autonomous vision company Mobileye in March, is pushing to expand in autonomous vehicles, a fast-growing industry, across a variety of business models. A collaboration with Waymo, considered by many industry experts to be at the forefront of autonomous technology, adds to its portfolio. The announcement marked the first time Waymo has acknowledged a collaboration with a supplier. Waymo, which began as the Google self-driving car project, has done most of its development work in-house. Waymo, which has developed its own sensors, is not using the autonomous vision system created by Mobileye.  Underscoring the non-exclusive partnerships and collaborations in the space, Mobileye and Intel are in an alliance with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Fiat-Chrysler to create an industrywide autonomous car platform. Waymo CEO John Krafcik said fast processing was crucial to the performance of its autonomous vehicles.  “Intel’s technology supports the advanced processing inside our vehicles, with the ability to manufacture to meet Waymo’s needs at scale,” Krafcik said in a statement. Intel also said on Monday it had invested $1 billion in artificial intelligence companies over the past three years. "
2017-09-18,7,"The world’s largest computer chipmaker said its Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity were used in the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans that Waymo has been using since 2015 to test its self-driving system. “As Waymo’s self-driving technology becomes smarter and more capable, its high-performance hardware and software will require even more powerful and efficient compute,” said Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich in a statement announcing the ongoing collaboration. Intel, which announced the $15 billion acquisition of autonomous vision company Mobileye in March, is pushing to expand its real estate in autonomous vehicles, a fast-growing industry. A collaboration with Waymo, considered by many industry experts to be at the forefront of autonomous technology, adds to its portfolio. The announcement marked the first time Waymo, formerly Google’s autonomous program, has acknowledged a collaboration with a supplier. The company has done most of its development work in-house. Intel began supplying chips for then-Google’s autonomous program beginning in 2009, but that relationship grew into a deeper collaboration when Google began working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to develop and install the company’s autonomous driving technology into the automaker’s minivans.

Although the need for security is growing quickly, the proliferation of start-ups means that several companies compete in every subsector. Team8 has already launched two cyber companies, Claroty and Illusive Networks, and two others will follow suit soon. Team8 co-founder and CEO Nadav Zafrir told Reuters that one company will move out of stealth mode in a few weeks while another will do the same in early 2018 without elaborating. He noted that each of the syndicate members has a different perspective on cyber.  “Citi enables us to see the world from a financial standpoint. With Intel joining we will see the challenges going forward in cybersecurity like computing, automotive, cloud, mobile and IoT (Internet of Things),” Zafrir said. “Together we can address the (cyber) problems before they emerge.” Intel will also collaborate with Illusive, which catches attackers once they break into corporate networks using deception technologies, to help combat so-called advanced persistent threats (APTs). The alliance between Illusive and Intel extends deception-based cyber security from software to hardware, Illusive said. “Our collaboration with Illusive networks provides users with more effective defenses against sophisticated APTs, in the early stage of the attack, that otherwise go undetected and pose a great threat to enterprises and individuals,” said Jacob Mendel, general manager of Intel’s platform security division.

2017-09-07,-1,"A 5G network is expected to offer faster speeds, more capacity and shorter response times while supporting uses ranging from self-driving cars to remote surgeries. Telecom companies and their suppliers consider it to be a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. Intel has five 5G trials with global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call in July. One such trial, with wireless carrier AT&T, involves a 5G broadband service that could be introduced as soon as late 2018. Intel’s mobile trial equipment, which looks like a large box, handles the processing needs for a 5G connection. The updated version, slated for the fourth quarter, will support new 5G standards that the Third Generation Partnership Project, a telecom group known as 3GPP, is expected to release in late 2017. As a result, the new platform will allow Intel’s partners to “really see what works and what doesn‘t,” Rob Topol, general manager of 5G business and technology, said in an interview. Intel participated in 3GPP’s working groups to develop the 5G standards, Topol said. 3GPP also developed current mobile phone standards for 4G LTE.

2017-06-21,-1,"Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel’s sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality. “We’ll allow people online to feel like they are there,” Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel’s business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see “tangible returns” from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.  “We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world’s athletes to meet next February,” Lumme said.

2017-07-11,3,"The chips are aimed at companies including Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc  and others that operate data centers with thousands of computers, both to power their own services and to provide computing horsepower for customers who don’t want to own and maintain their own computer systems.  Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an “expansion and deepening of our partnership” with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators. “The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,” he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

2017-03-13,-4,"The company’s largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel’s larger PC business.      Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion.     “We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.     Rasgon, who rates the stock “underperform”, notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue.

2017-07-05,-8,"McAfee said he sued after Intel warned him that using his name, including by renaming his digital gaming and cybersecurity company MGT Capital Investments Inc (MGTI.PK) as “John McAfee Global Technologies Inc,” would infringe its trademarks. Intel countered by accusing McAfee of trademark infringement and unfair competition, and sought unspecified damages. Under the settlement, McAfee agreed not to use his name, trademark his name or the phrase “John McAfee Privacy Phone,” or use “John McAfee Global Technologies” in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He retained the right in other contexts to use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations, including with regard to his role at McAfee Associates, which he sold to Intel for $7.7 billion in 2010. Neither McAfee nor Intel admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which was amicable, according to court papers. McAfee’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Intel said the Santa Clara, California-based company was pleased to settle. Intel spun off its cybersecurity division, now called McAfee LLC, in April, after agreeing to sell a 51 percent stake to private investment firm TPG Capital. TPG later accepted a minority investment in the business from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Intel retained a 49 percent stake in McAfee, which the spinoff valued at $4.2 billion including debt.

Waymo, which began as the Google self-driving car project, has done most of its development work in-house. Waymo, which has developed its own sensors, is not using the autonomous vision system created by Mobileye.  Underscoring the non-exclusive partnerships and collaborations in the space, Mobileye and Intel are in an alliance with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Fiat-Chrysler to create an industrywide autonomous car platform. Waymo CEO John Krafcik said fast processing was crucial to the performance of its autonomous vehicles.  “Intel’s technology supports the advanced processing inside our vehicles, with the ability to manufacture to meet Waymo’s needs at scale,” Krafcik said in a statement. Intel also said on Monday it had invested $1 billion in artificial intelligence companies over the past three years. "
2017-07-05,-9,"U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan dismissed McAfee’s September 2016 lawsuit and a countersuit by Intel on Wednesday, five days after a settlement agreement was signed. McAfee said he sued after Intel warned him that using his name, including by renaming his digital gaming and cybersecurity company MGT Capital Investments Inc as “John McAfee Global Technologies Inc,” would infringe its trademarks. Intel countered by accusing McAfee of trademark infringement and unfair competition, and sought unspecified damages. Under the settlement, McAfee agreed not to use his name, trademark his name or the phrase “John McAfee Privacy Phone,” or use “John McAfee Global Technologies” in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He retained the right in other contexts to use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations, including with regard to his role at McAfee Associates, which he sold to Intel for $7.7 billion in 2010. Neither McAfee nor Intel admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which was amicable, according to court papers. McAfee’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Intel said the Santa Clara, California-based company was pleased to settle. Intel spun off its cybersecurity division, now called McAfee LLC, in April, after agreeing to sell a 51 percent stake to private investment firm TPG Capital. TPG later accepted a minority investment in the business from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Intel retained a 49 percent stake in McAfee, which the spinoff valued at $4.2 billion including debt. John McAfee unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party’s nomination for the U.S. presidency last year.

2017-07-27,-2,"Intel has been grappling with a declining PC industry it helped found and has been pushing into making chips that power data centers and also into autonomous vehicle technology. The company agreed in March to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting Intel into the forefront of the market.  Intel expects to close the Mobileye purchase in the current quarter, several months earlier than expected, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings call on Thursday. The company is also benefiting from lower-than-expected declines in personal computer shipments.  Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs were down 3.3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations of a 3.9 percent decline, research firm IDC said this month. (bit.ly/2vNe2u7) Revenue in Intel’s client computing, the biggest contributor to sales and which supplies chips to PC makers, rose 12 percent to $8.21 billion. Analysts had expected $7.88 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Revenue from the data center business, a focus for the company, rose 9 percent to $4.37 billion, but missed expectation of $4.41 billion, according to FactSet.  The company’s Internet of Things business grew 26 percent to $720 million. Intel said it expected full-year adjusted earnings to be $3 per share, plus or minus 5 percent, or $2.85 to $3.15. The new forecast is 15 cents higher than the previous estimate.      Intel also increased its full-year revenue forecast by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.  Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $2.86 per share and revenue of $60.22 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On an adjusted basis, Intel earned 72 cents per share in the second quarter, ahead of analysts' estimate of 68 cents. (bit.ly/2h6LbO2) Adjusted for certain items, revenue was $14.76 billion, ahead of estimates of $14.41 billion.      "

2017-03-13,1,"Intel estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be about $70 billion in 2030. While that’s an absurdly long time frame for a financial prediction, the eventual amount could easily be far higher. The fast-expanding ability of computers to make sense of the world by sight will probably create undreamed-of markets.   Combining the entrepreneurial Israeli outfit and the blue-chip Intel may be awkward. It has struggled to integrate acquisitions before. Having paid $7.7 billion for McAfee in 2010, for example, Intel sold a majority of the unit six years later in a deal valuing it at just $4.2 billion. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich is, at least, leaving Mobileye’s Ziv Aviram in charge, parking the $167 billion chipmaker’s self-driving unit in its new acquisition’s garage.  The financial justification for the deal, though, is a stretch. The $175 million of expected cost cuts carry a present value of around $1 billion once taxed, discounted and capitalized. That’s a country mile from the roughly $4 billion premium Intel is paying. That leaves Krzanich and his shareholders relying on Mobileye’s stunning growth continuing. Revenue is speeding ahead at a 45 percent annual clip while its operating margin of around 35 percent in recent quarters could hit 60 percent in the coming years, according to the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts.  Intel will need to sustain these for five years before the deal starts earning close to Intel’s cost of capital. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Google-parent Alphabet and a slew of other firms are gunning for the market. That leaves plenty of chances for spanners to end up in the gears."

Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an “expansion and deepening of our partnership” with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators. “The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,” he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

2017-09-04,-6,"The European Commission in a 2009 decision said that Intel tried to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett Packard, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from the company. It handed down a 1.06 billion euro ($1.3 billion) fine, a record that was subsequently eclipsed by the 2.4 billion euro fine levied on Google in June this year. A lower court upheld the EU competition authority’s decision in 2014, but last year an ECJ court adviser backed Intel’s arguments. An adverse ruling for the Commission on Wednesday could result in a radical review of ongoing cases, said Andrew Ward, a partner at Madrid-based law firm Cuatrecasas. “A loss in such a high-profile case would be embarrassing (for the regulator),” he said, adding that it might mean that long-established theories and processes would need to be reassessed. “Losing against Intel would clearly be a blow to the Commission and a confidence boost for Google, since on the face of it the theory of harm is much more established in the Intel case.” Google has come under fire from the EU over its Android smartphone operating system and online search advertising.  U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces EU charges of using anti-competitive methods to squeeze out British phone software maker Icera and of making illegal payments to a major customer for exclusively using its chipsets since 2011. It would be a rare departure, however, for the ECJ to go against the Commission. “If the Commission wins, it will be business as usual. They will be even more confident in their agenda,” another lawyer said. "

2017-10-26,-1,"For the full year, the company said it expects to earn, on an adjusted basis, $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $3.01 per share on revenue of $61.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In July, the company had previously forecast full-year adjusted profit of $3 per share on revenue of $61.3 billion. “The combination of a solid quarter and healthy guidance will be something the bulls can hang their hat on tomorrow,” Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights said. Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent to $4.9 billion in the third quarter, beating analysts’ expectation of $4.79 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. “We’re going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business,” Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said on a call. Intel, which has been switching its focus to the data center business, is also venturing into newer areas such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars to reduce its reliance on the PC market. The chipmaker completed the acquisition of Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N in August to compete with peers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and tap the fast-growing market of driverless cars. “With cloud, Internet of Things, and self-driving cars creating newer growth areas, now is the time for Intel to lay the seeds of growth in these key areas,” Ives said. Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls its PC chip business, remained flat at $8.9 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.68 billion, according to FactSet. Intel recently launched its Coffee Lake line of processors, which analysts believe will pose challenges for rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (AMD.O) Ryzen processors.

2017-11-21,-12,"Security experts said that it was not clear how difficult it would be to exploit the vulnerabilities to launch attacks, though they found the disclosure troubling because the affected chips were widely used.  “These vulnerabilities affect essentially every business computer and server with an Intel processor released in the last two years,” said Jay Little, a security engineer with cyber consulting firm Trail of Bits. For a remote attack to succeed, a vulnerable machine would need to be configured to allow remote access, and a hacker would need to know the administrator’s user name and password, Little said. Attackers could break in without those credentials if they have physical access to the computer, he said. Intel said that it knew of no cases where hackers had exploited the vulnerability in a cyber attack. The Department of Homeland Security advised computer users to review the warning from Intel, which includes a software tool that checks whether a computer has a vulnerable chip. It also urged them to contact computer makers to obtain software updates and advice on strategies for mitigating the threat. (bit.ly/2zqhccw) Intel spokeswoman Agnes Kwan said the company had provided software patches to fix the issue to all major computer manufacturers, though it was up to them to distribute patches to computers users.     Dell’s support website offered patches for servers, but not laptop or desktop computers, as of midday Tuesday. Lenovo offered fixes for some servers, laptops and tablets and said more updates would be available Friday. HP posted patches to its website on Tuesday evening. Security experts noted that it could take time to fix vulnerable systems because installing patches on computer chips is a difficult process.   “Patching software is hard. Patching hardware is even harder,” said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber startup Obsidian Security. "

2017-04-27,0,"Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. “I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business’s margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel’s total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion.

U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces EU charges of using anti-competitive methods to squeeze out British phone software maker Icera and of making illegal payments to a major customer for exclusively using its chipsets since 2011. It would be a rare departure, however, for the ECJ to go against the Commission. “If the Commission wins, it will be business as usual. They will be even more confident in their agenda,” another lawyer said. "
2017-11-21,-13,"Homeland Security gave the guidance a day after Intel said it had identified security vulnerabilities in remote-management software known as “Management Engine” that shipped with eight types of processors used in business computers sold by Dell Technologies Inc, Lenovo Group Ltd, HP Inc , Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and other manufacturers. Security experts said that it was not clear how difficult it would be to exploit the vulnerabilities to launch attacks, though they found the disclosure troubling because the affected chips were widely used. “These vulnerabilities affect essentially every business computer and server with an Intel processor released in the last two years,” said Jay Little, a security engineer with cyber consulting firm Trail of Bits. For a remote attack to succeed, a vulnerable machine would need to be configured to allow remote access, and a hacker would need to know the administrator’s user name and password, Little said. Attackers could break in without those credentials if they have physical access to the computer, he said. Intel said that it knew of no cases where hackers had exploited the vulnerability in a cyber attack. Homeland Security advised computer users to review the warning from Intel, which includes a software tool that checks whether a computer has a vulnerable chip. It also urged them to contact computer makers to obtain software updates and advice on strategies for mitigating the threat. (bit.ly/2zqhccw) Intel spokeswoman Agnes Kwan said the company had provided software patches to fix the issue to all major computer manufacturers, though it was up to them to distribute patches to computers users. Dell’s support website offered patches for servers, but not laptop or desktop computers, as of midday Tuesday. Lenovo offered fixes for some servers, laptops and tablets and said more updates would be available Friday. An HP representative said the company would soon post fixes on its support site. Security experts noted that it could take time to fix vulnerable systems because installing patches on computer chips is a difficult process. “Patching software is hard. Patching hardware is even harder,” said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber startup Obsidian Security. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

2017-11-08,-1,"“The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit. Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners. Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance. Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021. The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s  Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place. Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said. If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman. “[Broadcom] would basically own the majority of the high-end components in the smart phone market and they would have a very significant influence on 5G standards, which are paramount as you think about autonomous vehicles” and connected factories, he said.

2017-04-27,0,"Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. “I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business’s margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel’s total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analysts' estimate. (bit.ly/2pr8dBB) "
2017-06-21,-1,"Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel’s sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality. “We’ll allow people online to feel like they are there,” Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel’s business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see “tangible returns” from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.  “We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world’s athletes to meet next February,” Lumme said.

2017-03-15,-1,"“We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy,” Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition. The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday. Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch’s own strategy. “I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor,” he said. “What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye.” Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental, have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example Valeo, which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye’s products instead. Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP, Software AG, IBM, General Electric and Amazon. The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations. The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle’s surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road. The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020.  “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it’s a promise,” Denner told the news conference. "
2017-03-13,-2,"It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors.  Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical... The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.”  The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP.  The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent.  The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). MERGING ‘EYES’ AND ‘BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017. "

2017-03-15,-1,"Self-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data. “Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal.  To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start.  “That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters. “When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.” Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which mean those carmakers’ vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. “This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies. Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye’s camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers.  Traditional suppliers like Germany’s Continental or Sweden’s AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play “catch-up” to Intel, said Evercore’s Chris McNally in a note. One issue still to be hammered out is who owns the data a self-driving car collects and whether the passenger has a privacy right.  While drivers may not be spooked by access to their aggregated mapping and navigation data, they may balk at sharing personal data and preferences, McKinsey wrote last year. Some data deserves to be shared, Winter argued in a February blog. “Every autonomous car out there shouldn’t have to find the same pothole and log it,” she wrote.  "

2017-07-27,-2,"Intel has been grappling with a declining PC industry it helped found and has been pushing into making chips that power data centers and also into autonomous vehicle technology. The company agreed in March to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting Intel into the forefront of the market.  Intel expects to close the Mobileye purchase in the current quarter, several months earlier than expected, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings call on Thursday. The company is also benefiting from lower-than-expected declines in personal computer shipments.  Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs were down 3.3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations of a 3.9 percent decline, research firm IDC said this month. (bit.ly/2vNe2u7) Revenue in Intel’s client computing, the biggest contributor to sales and which supplies chips to PC makers, rose 12 percent to $8.21 billion. Analysts had expected $7.88 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Revenue from the data center business, a focus for the company, rose 9 percent to $4.37 billion, but missed expectation of $4.41 billion, according to FactSet.  The company’s Internet of Things business grew 26 percent to $720 million. Intel said it expected full-year adjusted earnings to be $3 per share, plus or minus 5 percent, or $2.85 to $3.15. The new forecast is 15 cents higher than the previous estimate.      Intel also increased its full-year revenue forecast by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.  Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $2.86 per share and revenue of $60.22 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On an adjusted basis, Intel earned 72 cents per share in the second quarter, ahead of analysts' estimate of 68 cents. (bit.ly/2h6LbO2) Adjusted for certain items, revenue was $14.76 billion, ahead of estimates of $14.41 billion.      "
2017-03-15,-1,"“We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy,” Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition. The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday. Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch’s own strategy. “I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor,” he said. “What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye.” Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental, have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example Valeo, which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye’s products instead. Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP, Software AG, IBM, General Electric and Amazon. The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations. The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle’s surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road. The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020.  “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it’s a promise,” Denner told the news conference.

2017-11-21,-12,"Security experts said that it was not clear how difficult it would be to exploit the vulnerabilities to launch attacks, though they found the disclosure troubling because the affected chips were widely used.  “These vulnerabilities affect essentially every business computer and server with an Intel processor released in the last two years,” said Jay Little, a security engineer with cyber consulting firm Trail of Bits. For a remote attack to succeed, a vulnerable machine would need to be configured to allow remote access, and a hacker would need to know the administrator’s user name and password, Little said. Attackers could break in without those credentials if they have physical access to the computer, he said. Intel said that it knew of no cases where hackers had exploited the vulnerability in a cyber attack. The Department of Homeland Security advised computer users to review the warning from Intel, which includes a software tool that checks whether a computer has a vulnerable chip. It also urged them to contact computer makers to obtain software updates and advice on strategies for mitigating the threat. (bit.ly/2zqhccw) Intel spokeswoman Agnes Kwan said the company had provided software patches to fix the issue to all major computer manufacturers, though it was up to them to distribute patches to computers users.     Dell’s support website offered patches for servers, but not laptop or desktop computers, as of midday Tuesday. Lenovo offered fixes for some servers, laptops and tablets and said more updates would be available Friday. HP posted patches to its website on Tuesday evening. Security experts noted that it could take time to fix vulnerable systems because installing patches on computer chips is a difficult process.   “Patching software is hard. Patching hardware is even harder,” said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber startup Obsidian Security. "
2017-03-15,-1,"By Alexandria Sage SAN FRANCISCO, March 14 (Reuters) - To understand Intel’s $15.3 billion proposed acquisition of Israel’s Mobileye, imagine the data created and compiled by a self-driving car scanning the road and objects around it as a potential source of revenue. That data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology. Self-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data. “Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal. To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start. “That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters. “When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.” Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time.

2017-03-13,-2,"* Mobileye shares up 28.2 percent to $60.62   (Adds analysts’ comments, skepticism about self-driving cars) By Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul Lienert JERUSALEM/DETROIT, March 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical... The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING ‘EYES’ AND ‘BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

2017-01-26,3,"Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand.     “In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users’ shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company’s revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday’s close, Intel’s shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index. "

Intel did not disclose how much it would pay for the stake but said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. The deal highlights a shift in the dynamics of research and development in the car industry, which until recently saw automakers largely dictating terms for suppliers to manufacture their proprietary technologies at specified volumes and prices. Now carmakers are increasingly striking partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles.

2017-10-31,0,"The change would affect iPhones released in the fall of 2018, but Apple could still change course before then, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. A number of analysts, however, raised questions about the wisdom of Apple switching from one of its long-time vendors at a time when it has already had to push back the release of its 10th anniversary iPhone X due to issues with new tech. “While Intel’s new modem does support CDMA, it will be their first generation CDMA device, which carries inherent risks,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso told Reuters. Another analyst, Baird Equity’s Tristan Gerra, said the share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years from less than 50 percent currently. “The jury is still out if Apple decides to go in this direction and away from Qualcomm but it would be a potentially game-changing move,” Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights told Reuters. One analyst estimated the annual value of Qualcomm’s share of Apple chips at about $1.5-1.75 billion in revenue compared to the chipmaker’s 2016 revenue of $23.55 billion and Intel’s nearly $60 billion.

The change would affect iPhones released in the fall of 2018, but Apple could still change course before then, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Shares of Intel Corp — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. Analysts have estimated Qualcomm to have just over 50 percent of the share of modem chips in iPhones, with Intel making up the rest. “Qualcomm’s share represents about $1.5-1.75 billion in annual revenue,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said. That estimate is less than a tenth of Qualcomm’s 2016 revenue of $23.55 billion, and under 5 percent of Intel’s annual revenue of nearly $60 billion. The share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years, rapidly shrinking losses in the chipmaker’s mobile phone business, Baird Equity analyst Tristan Gerra said. Qualcomm’s shares were down 6.7 percent at $50.99 in midday trading on Tuesday. Apple’s shares rose 1.3 percent to a record high after reviewers gave an overwhelmingly positive verdict for the iPhone X.

2017-01-26,3,"Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand.     “In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users’ shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company’s revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday’s close, Intel’s shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index. "

2017-10-31,-4,"By Sonam Rai and Laharee Chatterjee Oct 31 (Reuters) - Shares in Qualcomm Inc fell as much as 8 percent on Tuesday on reports that Apple Inc would not use its modem chips in iPhones and iPads from next year. Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship took a bad turn earlier this year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The change would affect iPhones released in the fall of 2018, but Apple could still change course before then, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Shares of Intel Corp — which analysts have said would benefit the most if Apple switches vendors — rose 3.2 percent and hit a 17-year high on Tuesday. A number of analysts, however, raised questions about the wisdom of Apple switching from one of its long-time vendors at a time when it has already had to push back the release of its 10th anniversary iPhone X due to issues with new tech. “While Intel’s new modem does support CDMA, it will be their first generation CDMA device, which carries inherent risks,” Raymond James analyst Chris Caso told Reuters. Another analyst, Baird Equity’s Tristan Gerra, said the share of Intel’s modem chips in the iPhone could approach 100 percent within the next two years from less than 50 percent currently. “The jury is still out if Apple decides to go in this direction and away from Qualcomm but it would be a potentially game-changing move,” Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights told Reuters. One analyst estimated the annual value of Qualcomm’s share of Apple chips at about $1.5-1.75 billion in revenue compared to the chipmaker’s 2016 revenue of $23.55 billion and Intel’s nearly $60 billion.

BMW and its partners Intel  and Mobileye said FCA would bring engineering and other expertise to the deal, paving the way to creating an industry-wide autonomous car platform which other carmakers could adopt. Automakers are seeking alliances to share the high costs of developing autonomous cars, which according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan will make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne cited the “synergies and economies of scale” possible in joining the alliance.  Marchionne has long argued that automakers must merge in order to survive the prohibitively high costs of making more technologically advanced vehicles.  In April, he said FCA was looking for new partners in self-driving development because “banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous”. FCA is also part of a separate alliance with Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo to develop self-driving cars based on Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. Autonomous cars will allow carmakers to disrupt the taxi market which is run by fleet operators and ride-hailing firms. Without having to pay drivers, ride-hailing could become more cost effective and compete against other forms of transport including buses.  Ride-hailing services, which make up around 33 percent of the global taxi market, could grow eightfold to $285 billion by 2030, once autonomous robotaxis are in operation, according to Goldman Sachs. Auto suppliers Delphi Automotive and Continental have also joined the BMW-Intel alliance.

The South Korean tech giant, Asia’s third-largest company by market capitalization, is now poised to knock Intel off the top of the global semiconductor market-share rankings for the first time since 1991.  “From the second quarter, Samsung will become No. 1 in market share due to the recent increase in data centers and demand for solid-state drives,” NH Investment & Securities analyst Peter Lee wrote in a note to clients.   Samsung’s April-June operating profit is expected to leap 67 percent from a year earlier to 13.1 trillion won ($11.4 billion), a new high, according to the average forecast from a Thomson Reuters survey of 18 analysts.  The same survey expects July-September profit to be even higher at 13.8 trillion won.  Solid sales of the Galaxy S8 smartphone launched in April likely provided an additional boost, keeping the firm ahead of rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the world’s top smartphone maker. The S8’s performance has reassured investors whose nerves were shaken last year by the costly withdrawal of Samsung’s premium Galaxy Note 7 due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung shares are trading at a near-record high of 2.35 million won each as of Tuesday. They have gained 30 percent so far this year on top of a 43 percent surge in 2016.

Samsung is also preparing to unveil the Galaxy Note 8 in August, a source told Reuters, restoring the company’s schedule of market-moving gadget releases after the interruption of the Note 7 debacle.  The company will issue earnings guidance early on Friday but will not disclose details on its performance until late July.   Nomura has predicted DRAM chip prices will continue to rise in the second half of 2017 due to limited supply and strong demand driven by servers. Demand for solid-state drives (SSD) and smartphones would maintain profits for producers of NAND semiconductors, despite an easing of a production bottleneck, it said.  "

2017-05-31,-29,"Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the spy agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to “unmask” names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. “Subpoenas related to the ‘unmasking’ issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committee’s Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minority’s (Democrats’) agreement,” said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Any prior requests for information would have been undertaken without the minority’s knowledge.” Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, insisted that Democrats were “informed and consulted” before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americans’ names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two men’s firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. “As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records,” Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow."

2017-06-07,-13,"Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms. “We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans,” White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial  published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats.  NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners’ digital communications, normally comes with a “sunset” clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702.  Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats “went back on a pledge.” “After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans’ communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.  Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.

2017-04-07,-6,"The SEC on Thursday said it won a court order freezing assets of Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul, both of Richmond, after they generated more than $925,000 of gains on Mobileye shares and call options purchased in the month-and-a-half before the March 13 merger was announced. News of the transaction caused shares of Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. The SEC filed civil charges against Cluff and Shaoul nearly two weeks after charging two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, with insider trading in Mobileye, and generating more than $4.9 million of gains. It was unclear whether Cluff and Shaoul have hired lawyers. Cluff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shaoul could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters obtained a filed copy of the complaint, which was not immediately available in online court records. According to the SEC, Cluff’s and Shaoul’s “highly suspicious” trading occurred after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul’s adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel’s interest in Mobileye. The SEC also said both defendants, like Darvasi and Waldman, were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. According to the complaint, the suspicious trading occurred in two accounts held in Cluff’s name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time formal merger talks began. The second account generated a return in six weeks of about 492 percent on the $188,000 that had been wired in during February, the SEC said. Neither Jerusalem-based Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing. Mobileye and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is SEC v Cluff et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02460."

2017-05-11,-3,"“The intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018, even with a modest increase in (the)military assistance by the United States and its partners,” Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a Senate hearing. In February, Army General John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said he needs several thousand more international troops to break a stalemate with the Taliban. Reuters reported in late April that Trump’s administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and conversations are revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops to Afghanistan. Deliberations include giving more authorities to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters. This could allow U.S. advisers to work with Afghan troops below the corps level, potentially putting them closer to fighting, a U.S. official said. In the same hearing, the head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency said the situation would worsen unless U.S. trainers worked with Afghan soldiers closer to the front line, their numbers increased and there was greater intelligence and surveillance.  Trump has not been formally presented with the options yet. Some U.S. officials said they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded. President Ashraf Ghani’s U.S.-backed government remains plagued by corruption and divided by factions loyal to political strongmen whose armed supporters often are motivated by ethnic, family, and regional loyalties. Coats said that Afghanistan would struggle to decrease its reliance on the international community “until it contains the insurgency or reaches a peace agreement with the Taliban.” "

A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the House of Representatives is working on legislation that would renew Section 702 but with additional transparency and oversight, among other changes, though it remains unclear if it would have enough support to pass Congress and be signed by Trump.

2017-05-17,-1,"“Decisions about what President Trump discusses with anybody that he has in the White House is a matter for President Trump,” May told a news conference when asked whether Trump’s disclosure had made her reluctant to share intelligence with him. “We continue to work with the United States and continue to share intelligence with the United States as we do with others around the world because we are all working together to deal with the threats that we face.” The question came during a press briefing ahead of Britain’s June 8 election, which polls show May is on course to win, and in which national security is seen as one of her political strengths. May is a former interior minister who spent six years in charge of the domestic security brief. May was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration, and has repeatedly reaffirmed the special relationship between the two countries: a military and economic alliance dating back to 19th century. Trump has endured a week of tumult at the White House after he fired the head of the FBI and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. But, May said she remained confident in the special relationship, highlighting the need to cooperate with the United States and other allies to counter the security threats posed by Islamic State and al-Qaeda. “We continue to work together and we have confidence in that relationship between us and the United States that it helps to keep us all safer,” she said. "
2017-05-17,-8,"The New York Times, citing a current and a former U.S. official, reported on Tuesday that the information Trump divulged came from an Israeli intelligence asset based in Islamic State-held territory in Syria.  Israeli officials have declined to confirm whether they were the source of the information Trump shared, but have been quick to say counter-terrorism coordination with the United States is strong. On Tuesday, Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss his visit to Israel next week, but the two did not discuss the intelligence leak during their 20-minute conversation, the prime minister’s office said.  “The security relationship between Israel & our greatest ally the United States is deep, significant &  unprecedented in volume,” Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Twitter, remarks that were echoed by the intelligence minister.  Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to Washington, issued a similar statement, saying: “Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump.” Israeli intelligence experts said they could not confirm whether an Israeli asset was the source. But they said Israel had developed a deep network of human and signal intelligence across the region and it was plausible that it had managed to infiltrate Islamic State as part of that long-running effort. “Israeli intelligence agencies have shown that they can have such human sources,” said Aviv Oreg, former head of the Al Qaeda and global jihad desk in the army’s military intelligence department, who now runs a counter-terrorism consultancy.  “It would take a lot to put someone inside ISIS. If there is an agent, I‘m sure it’s the only one. If we have really lost a human source over there, it’s a major loss and it will take years to regenerate another one,” he said. “Israel will be furious about it,” he added, highlighting that it was likely to have implications for how Israel operates its human intelligence assets more broadly, and may make others unwilling to cooperate with it in the future. At the same time, he said Israel understood that Trump, as president and commander-in-chief, had the authority to divulge the information, even if in doing so he had shown that he “has no experience in how to deal with intelligence.” While there were good reasons to assume the compromised source was an agent, he said it was also possible it was a well-placed piece of signal intelligence.  “When it comes to ISIS, they are very active in the social network world and on digital platforms. So who knows, all options are valid, even if as far as I understand the context, it looks like a human intelligence source.” Michael described Israel as having far better intelligence capabilities in the region than the United States, making it a critical partner for Washington. Yet both sides have an interest in continuing to cooperate fully on intelligence. “What happened is a problem, it shouldn’t have happened. But mistakes do get made, not only by the Americans, but sometimes by the Israelis too,” said Michael.  “I assume that Trump had other considerations in mind and was perhaps not aware of the consequences of what he was saying. But this should not change the level of cooperation, which needs to be constantly broadened and deepened.” Amnon Sofrin, former head of Mossad’s intelligence directorate, said the issue was unlikely to be touched on when Trump visits Israel on his first foreign trip next week. Handling the fallout from the leak would be dealt with through intelligence channels -- between Mossad and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency -- not diplomatic ones. “Cooperation between our two organizations is so solid that I don’t believe that a special event will cause any big damage, it may cause local damage, but not a disaster,” he said. “None of us in Israel’s intelligence community likes this event. But I think it can be put aside and allow (Trump‘s) visit to be very fulfilling and I hope very successful.” "

2017-08-16,1,"Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said it plans to put autonomous car technology into production by 2021, matching a timeframe shared by rival companies who are also developing self-driving cars. BMW and its partners Intel  and Mobileye said FCA would bring engineering and other expertise to the deal, paving the way to creating an industry-wide autonomous car platform which other carmakers could adopt. Automakers are seeking alliances to share the high costs of developing autonomous cars, which according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan will make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne cited the “synergies and economies of scale” possible in joining the alliance.  Marchionne has long argued that automakers must merge in order to survive the prohibitively high costs of making more technologically advanced vehicles.  In April, he said FCA was looking for new partners in self-driving development because “banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous”. FCA is also part of a separate alliance with Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo to develop self-driving cars based on Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. Autonomous cars will allow carmakers to disrupt the taxi market which is run by fleet operators and ride-hailing firms. Without having to pay drivers, ride-hailing could become more cost effective and compete against other forms of transport including buses.  Ride-hailing services, which make up around 33 percent of the global taxi market, could grow eightfold to $285 billion by 2030, once autonomous robotaxis are in operation, according to Goldman Sachs. Auto suppliers Delphi Automotive and Continental have also joined the BMW-Intel alliance. The consortium said it was on track to put 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road by the end of 2017, and would learn from the 100 test vehicles to be deployed by Mobileye in the United States later this year.

2017-03-14,-3,"Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the success of the Mosul operation would drive hundreds of IS militants and sympathizers from Southeast Asia back to their home countries. “Daesh is a common foe that we need to face,” Hishammuddin told reporters, using an Arab acronym for IS, after meeting Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in parliament. “If the offensive in Mosul is successful, we will see a lot of hardened returnees and sympathizers to the region, especially in Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Thailand.” He said Australia had also agreed to provide technological support and equipment in efforts to deal with the rising threat of IS in the region, particularly the Abu Sayyaf militant group that has pledged allegiance with IS. Muslim-majority Malaysia arrested more than 250 people between 2013 and 2016 over suspected militant activities linked to Islamic State. On Monday, Malaysian police said they arrested seven people, including five Filipinos, for suspected links to IS.

2016-10-18,0,"Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $15.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce their inventory,” Executive Vice President Stacy Smith said on a conference call with analysts. Last month, Intel raised its third-quarter revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving PC demand. The company’s decision to raise third-quarter forecast moved investors’ expectations to a higher level, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Revenue from the data center business, which offers storage and cloud-based software services, rose 9.7 percent to $4.54 billion in the third quarter, from a year earlier. Revenue growth from this unit for the full year will likely be in the high single digits, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on the call. Demand for cloud-based services has been growing as more businesses shift to cloud-computing methods. Intel, which has been hurt due to weak PC demand, said last month it was seeing signs of improvement among PC parts suppliers. According to research firm IDC, global PC shipments fell by a smaller-than-expected 3.9 percent in the third quarter. (bit.ly/2dIkLfi) Revenue from the company’s traditional PC business, which still accounts for over half of Intel’s total revenue, rose 4.5 percent to $8.89 billion. Excluding items, the company earned 80 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 73 cents. The company’s net revenue rose 9.1 percent to $15.78 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $15.58 billion.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1. The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow’s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied such meddling. State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts. “There is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,” one official said. “Obviously we’re going to consider the totality of circumstances.” State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is “significant,” officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia’s defense and intelligence sector. The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August. “We’ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress’ intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,” a second State Department official said. The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions.

Bryce Boland, chief technology officer for Asia Pacific, said the company had observed that APT32 was targeting not just multinational companies and organisations doing business in Vietnam but Philippine government agencies as well. “This is presumably in order to gain access to information about military preparation and understanding how the organisations within the government operate in order to be better prepared in case of potentially military conflict,” Boland said. “There are overlapping claims between Vietnam and the Philippines over some islands in the South China Sea and it is quite likely that intelligence gathering is starting around that,” Boland said. Vietnam has strongly rejected allegations it supports hacking. “The government of Vietnam does not allow any form of cyber attacks against organisations or individuals,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said earlier this month in response to similar accusations. “All cyber attacks or threats to cyber security must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and laws.” A spokesman for the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department did not immediately respond to a telephone call or text message requesting comment. The Philippines, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei contest all or parts of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. APT stands for advanced persistent threat, a term usually reserved for state-sponsored hacker groups. “We believe all of the activities of APT32 are aligned to the interests of the Vietnamese government,” Boland said.

2017-06-07,-13,"Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms. “We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans,” White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial  published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats.  NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners’ digital communications, normally comes with a “sunset” clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702.  Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats “went back on a pledge.” “After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans’ communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.  Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.

2016-10-20,-15,"“Intel’s appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review,” Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission’s 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel’s challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser’s opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl’s opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. “The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general’s opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong,” he said. “Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases.” U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel’s fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement.

2017-02-10,-14,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the air strikes had been launched based on coordinates provided to Russia by the Turkish military. “Unfortunately, our military, while carrying out strikes on terrorists, was guided by coordinates given to them by our Turkish partners, and Turkish servicemen should not have been present on those coordinates,” he told a conference call with reporters. “It was a lack of coordination in providing coordinates, that is how I would formulate it.”  The Turkish military said it regularly shared information with Russia about its operations in Syria as part of a deal in place with Moscow since Jan. 12.  It said it had given the coordinates of the building where the soldiers were killed to its Russian counterparts a day before the incident. The soldiers had been in the same spot for 10 days, the Turkish military said, noting that their position had been communicated to Russia’s Khmeimim air base in Syria, and in person to the Russian military attache in Ankara. Russia is a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the rebels who oppose him. In 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian air force jet that it said had crossed into Turkish airspace, though Moscow denied any incursion. The two countries have since repaired relations and have been coordinating efforts against Islamic State in al-Bab. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone after the incident and agreed to step up military coordination against Islamic State. Speaking with reporters in the city of Afyon, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Friday it was important that Putin had expressed his condolences to Erdogan. “From our side the issue is being investigated. Initial information shows this was an accident ... and an undesired incident as a result of incorrect information, coordinates,” Kurtulmus said in televised comments. “It has been understood that closer coordination is required, both with the coalition and with Russia.” "
2017-02-10,-14,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the air strikes had been launched based on coordinates provided to Russia by the Turkish military. “Unfortunately, our military, while carrying out strikes on terrorists, was guided by coordinates given to them by our Turkish partners, and Turkish servicemen should not have been present on those coordinates,” he told a conference call with reporters. “It was a lack of coordination in providing coordinates, that is how I would formulate it.”  The Turkish military said it regularly shared information with Russia about its operations in Syria as part of a deal in place with Moscow since Jan. 12.  It said it had given the coordinates of the building where the soldiers were killed to its Russian counterparts a day before the incident. The soldiers had been in the same spot for 10 days, the Turkish military said, noting that their position had been communicated to Russia’s Khmeimim air base in Syria, and in person to the Russian military attache in Ankara. Russia is a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the rebels who oppose him. In 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian air force jet that it said had crossed into Turkish airspace, though Moscow denied any incursion. The two countries have since repaired relations and have been coordinating efforts against Islamic State in al-Bab. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone after the incident and agreed to step up military coordination against Islamic State.

2016-10-18,0,"Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $15.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce their inventory,” Executive Vice President Stacy Smith said on a conference call with analysts. Last month, Intel raised its third-quarter revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving PC demand. The company’s decision to raise third-quarter forecast moved investors’ expectations to a higher level, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Revenue from the data center business, which offers storage and cloud-based software services, rose 9.7 percent to $4.54 billion in the third quarter, from a year earlier. Revenue growth from this unit for the full year will likely be in the high single digits, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on the call. Demand for cloud-based services has been growing as more businesses shift to cloud-computing methods. Intel, which has been hurt due to weak PC demand, said last month it was seeing signs of improvement among PC parts suppliers. According to research firm IDC, global PC shipments fell by a smaller-than-expected 3.9 percent in the third quarter. (bit.ly/2dIkLfi) Revenue from the company’s traditional PC business, which still accounts for over half of Intel’s total revenue, rose 4.5 percent to $8.89 billion. Excluding items, the company earned 80 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 73 cents. The company’s net revenue rose 9.1 percent to $15.78 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $15.58 billion. Net income rose to $3.38 billion, or 69 cents per shares, in the third quarter ended Oct. 1, from $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales in the company’s PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets.  However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc (HPQ.N), which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were “not as dead as people were thinking.” Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. “We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors,” Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40.

2016-09-15,1,"There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington‘s, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington’s study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products. Earlier this month, Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care. In August, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.

2016-10-20,-15,"“Intel’s appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review,” Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission’s 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel’s challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser’s opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl’s opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. “The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general’s opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong,” he said. “Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases.” U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel’s fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement.  The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) "

2017-01-10,-8,"“If the missile is threatening, it will be intercepted. If it’s not threatening, we won’t necessarily do so,” Carter said in his final news briefing before President Barack Obama’s  administration leaves office on Jan. 20. “Because it may be more to our advantage to, first of all, save our interceptor inventory, and, second, to gather intelligence from the flight, rather than do that (intercept the ICBM) when it’s not threatening.” The top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, who will stay in his role as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concurred with Carter at the event but did not enter into specifics. Carter’s language left open the possibility of U.S. military action in any scenario.  Carter’s remarks came just over a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump vowed that North Korea would never fulfill its threat to test an ICBM. Trump said in a Jan. 2 tweet: “It won’t happen!” A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office on Tuesday said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system itself a limited capability of shielding the United States. Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Former U.S. officials and other experts have said the United States essentially had two options when it came to trying to curb North Korea’s fast-expanding nuclear and missile programs - negotiate or take military action. Neither path offers certain success and the military option is fraught with huge dangers, especially for Japan and South Korea, U.S. allies in close proximity to North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned the situation risked getting dangerous “and it’s getting close to it right now.” “Because if he persists (on an ICBM)... it more immediately drags the United States into an immediate threat situation, to which we then may have to find other ways or more forceful ways of having an impact on the choices that he is making,” Kerry said at the U.S. Naval Academy.

2017-01-08,-27,"“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the report said. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” Russian authorities, which have previously denied interfering in the U.S. elections, offered no immediate comment on the report on Saturday, and the reaction of the country’s media was low-key.  The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump’s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report’s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed “the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election” nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. In Moscow, state TV Channel One briefly covered the report, focusing on Trump’s comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election. The broadcaster, which led its news program on Orthodox Christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the Russian capital, also said the arguments used in the U.S. report had been widely mocked by Internet users. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC’s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,” it said. “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. “Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” it said. ‘TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORY’ In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC. “There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence “relayed” the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump’s comments. “The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said. “It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying - which is true - it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to ... Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,” he said. “The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile “facts surrounding Russia’s active measures,” adding: “This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.” "

2017-01-06,-9,"The intelligence assessment was presented to President Barack Obama on Thursday and will be briefed to Trump on Friday. Trump has rejected the broad intelligence community’s assessment that Russia staged cyber attacks during the election campaign to undermine Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Russia has rejected the hacking allegations.  MORE FROM REUTERS* Trump says U.S. funds spent on border wall would be repaid by Mexico* Schumer emerges as Trump's newest punching bag* Beheading attire and sexy suicide vests? Satire of ISIS wives stirs anger and praise  ”By October, it had become clear that the Russians were trying to help the Trump campaign,” said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is Top Secret.  In some cases, one official said, the material followed what was called “a circuitous route” from the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, to WikiLeaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace, a common practice used by all intelligence agencies, including U.S. ones.  These handoffs, the officials said, enabled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to say the Russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website.  In an interview with Fox News this week, Assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party.  Details of the report emerged as the top U.S. intelligence official, James Clapper, said on Thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign.  Not all 17 intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment. An unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on Friday morning, two officials said.  The report contains some of what the officials called “minor footnotes” about open questions and other uncertainties, in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential.  One such example, the officials said, was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior Russian officials in Putin’s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated Trump’s election as a victorious end to the campaign.  The officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications, including whether they were domestic, international, or both.  ”People who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the United States,” said one official.  Another example of inferential evidence, the officials said, was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed Clinton’s campaign, the Russians increasingly focused their hacking “almost exclusively” on Democratic rather than Republican targets.  There was also strong resemblance -- including the use of the same computer malware -- the Russians have used against targets in Europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by Soviet and Russian intelligence such as bribery, blackmail and internet vulnerabilities, which they said Putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting.  For example, one official said, the Democratic databases and email servers the Russians hacked also contained personal information that WikiLeaks has not published.  Such information could be used to search for financial, medical, browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by Russian spies.  "

2016-09-15,1,"There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington‘s, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington’s study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products.

France Telecom’s mobile unit Orange will launch a smartphone in France and the United Kingdom this summer designed by Intel and using its newest processor. While the handset will be branded by Orange, its back cover will also boast the Intel swirl that consumers have come to expect to see on PCs over the past two decades. That’s a major milestone for Intel, whose chips are the brains in 80 percent of the world’s laptops and desktop computers but power virtually no smartphones or tablets to date. With PC sales flagging in the United States and Europe, nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple Inc’s  iPhones and iPads, use energy-efficient processors based on technology licensed to chip designers by Britain’s ARM Holdings and made by Intel rivals like Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm Inc. The new smartphone will run Google’s Android platform and be among others that Orange sells under its own brand. Aimed at Orange’s entry level, pay-as-you-go clients, the phone is a copy of a reference handset Intel created to showcase its newest mobile chip to potential customers, with features like high-definition video and an 8-megapixel camera. “This is a really big deal for us,” Mike Bell, who co-heads Intel’s mobile and wireless business and who is responsible for creating the reference phone, told Reuters. “It’s phenomenal that Orange has asked us to participate and put our Intel logo on the back.” Orange has hired Taiwanese hardware company Gigabyte  to manufacture the phones and is adding its own flavor by installing additional proprietary software. With Wall Street concerned Intel is being left behind in the mobile market, the Santa Clara, California chipmaker has been pouring resources into improving its offerings for smartphones and tablets. Previous attempts fell flat but Intel says its newest mobile processor, codenamed Medfield, stands up to rivals’ chips in power efficiency and performance. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, Intel impressed technophiles with demonstrations of its reference smartphone and said Motorola Mobility and Lenovo have picked Medfield for upcoming handsets. Intel launched its “Intel Inside” brand campaign in 1991, and its success at making customers loyal to a particular component in PCs, known as ingredient branding, defied many expectations at the time and has since become a case study."

The Razr M includes Qualcomm technology compatible with high-speed Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks in the United States, while the Razr i is limited to slower 3G phone networks relied on more in Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.

Altera, based in San Jose, California, rejected an earlier unsolicited offer of $54 per share from Intel in April, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters. The deal is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. Avago Technologies Ltd agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the industry’s biggest-ever takeover. "
2012-07-18,-17,"On Tuesday, the chipmaker, a barometer of the PC industry, cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 percent and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of ”high single-digit growth. “Intel is telling us, yes, things are weak, but it’s not disaster weak,” said Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann. “There had been a school of thought that they could guide down - and they didn‘t.” Shaky economies in Europe and the United States and a growing consumer preference for Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad tablets have been taking a toll on the PC industry. Fears that global PC sales could be worse than expected, with emerging signs of trouble in China, have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April and prior to Wednesday’s rally. Intel’s stock recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. With analysts now reducing their estimates for Intel’s future earnings, investors may see that PE ratio as more reflective of the chipmaker’s value. “Once the numbers get cut it allows investors to say: ‘I‘m more comfortable with the denominator in that PE calculation,'” Mosesmann said. Last week, tech investors got a jolt when Intel’s smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N, warned that its second-quarter revenue might plummet 11 percent compared with the first quarter. Also on Wednesday, IBM Corp (IBM.N) reports its quarterly earnings and investors will be watching the tech bellwether for signs of trouble in global enterprise IT spending. Some raised concerns about Intel’s inventory levels rising about 9 percent sequentially for the second quarter. “While we can’t rule out the risk that inventory build represents to gross margins, it is incumbent upon a weaker demand environment than Intel currently envisions; in other words, inventories themselves are not the problem - demand is the primary concern,” Citi Investment Research analysts said. Intel, which said a glut in its Ivy Bridge microarchitecture was the major reason for increased inventory, maintained its 2012 gross margin forecast of 64 percent. It also forecast that “Ultrabooks” would comprise 40 percent of all laptops sold by the year-end. Analysts at Piper Jaffray believe the company’s weaker outlook is also the result of “too expensive” Ultrabooks and consumers preferring smartphones and tablets to personal computers. “We expect lack of excitement in PC clients will drive a mix shift to lower price point notebooks and ultimately pressure gross margin and growth,” Piper Jaffray analysts said. Evercore Partners cut its price target on Intel stock to $26 from $27, while Canaccord Genuity lowered it to $26 from $28. Jefferies & Co reduced its target price on the stock to $29 from $30 and RBC Capital Markets cut it to $30 from $33.

There were no comparisons available with the new iPhone 5, which hits the shops later this month. The new Motorola phone uses a new version of Intel’s Medfield smartphone processor running at 2 Gigahertz, faster than the 1.6 GHz versions used in phones launched earlier this year by Orange in Britain, MegaFon in Russia and Lava International in India. Those phone launches were Intel’s first significant foray into the mobile market, and the Medfield chips used in them have performed better than many skeptics expected. The earlier Razr M includes Qualcomm technology compatible with high-speed Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks in the United States, while the Razr i is limited to slower 3G phone networks relied on more in Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Offering the similar Razr i and Razr M phones, powered by Intel and Qualcomm chips respectively, will create a new opportunity for investors to compare the performance of the two companies’ best chips. The combined market for PCs, smartphones and tablets is expected to almost double over the next four years, but Intel’s share of the processors used in them will dip from 35 percent to 29 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli.

2016-07-01,0,"Now carmakers are increasingly striking up partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles.  ”Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on Friday at a joint news conference announcing the alliance. The three companies said their new platform would be made available to multiple carmakers and they expected vehicles with highly and fully-automated driving would be brought into mass production by 2021. It is too early to say which other carmakers would join the alliance, BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said at a news conference on the outskirts of Munich on Friday. Sophisticated cruise control systems already enable “hands off” driving as cameras and computers allow cars to automatically brake, steer and accelerate in traffic at low speeds. But drivers are required to stay in control.  Now BMW, Intel and Mobileye will develop cars with even higher levels of automation described as “eyes off,” “mind off,” and “driver off”. This requires much more computing power and software know-how, forcing traditional carmakers to collaborate more closely with technology specialists. Both industries see huge revenue opportunities in the market for autonomous vehicles, although it is unclear how many drivers will be prepared to relinquish control and how quickly laws will be put in place to allow fully autonomous vehicles on the roads. But creating common technology standards would help all manufacturers update their vehicles faster, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said. “That will be critical for advancing the safety aspects of this.”  A common approach to standards will also make it easier for regulators to understand and approve the roadworthiness of a vehicle while still leaving enough scope for individual car manufacturers to customize their cars, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said. Beyond technological hurdles there are legal questions over who is responsible when a crash occurs. On Thursday, the driver of a Tesla Model S car, operating in Autopilot mode, was killed in a collision with a truck in the United States, prompting an investigation by federal highway safety regulators.  When asked about the crash, BMW CEO Harald Krueger said: “The accident is very sad .... We believe today the technologies are not ready for series production,” he added, explaining the alliance had not forecast that until 2021. “For the BMW group, safety comes first,” he said.  As part of the new alliance, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker which has been looking to expand into the automotive electronics market, will supply the microprocessors - or central processing units - to control an array of sensors.

It said several -- including Hewlett-Packard Co , Dell Inc, IBM, Oracle Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc -- are expected to announce Xeon-based server platforms on Tuesday. While Intel lags Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics  in selling processors for smartphones and tablets, Intel executives have pointed to their server business as key to capitalizing on fast growth in the mobile market. The popularity of smartphones and other mobile gadgets has increased the need for massive computer centers that store data and feed email, videos and other information to those devices.

2016-09-07,-6,"Intel, which bought McAfee for $7.7 billion in 2011, will retain a 49 percent stake in the business.  The deal ends a failed effort by Intel to stake out a major position in the computer security business. At the time of the acquisition, Intel spoke of integrating McAfee security technology into its chips, but little came of those plans. Intel executives at the time also said they hoped the acquisition would give it a piece of the emerging business of protecting corporations from sophisticated espionage, but newer players such as Mandiant, now a unit of FireEye (FEYE.O), came to dominate that business. At the same time, PC growth slowed, eroding the traditional McAfee customer base’s potential. The unit, rebranded as Intel Security Group in 2014, will revert to the McAfee brand name following the closing of the deal, expected in the second quarter of 2017. McAfee’s founder, John McAfee, was for a time on the run from a murder investigation in Belize and is a pariah in the industry. He recently sued Intel to get back the right to use his name. Chris Young, Intel Security’s general manager, will be named  chief executive of the new company. Intel Security’s revenue rose 11 percent to $1.1 billion through the first half of this year, the company said in a statement.  TPG, which is making a $1.1 billion equity investment in the company, first approached Intel’s board about a potential transaction for McAfee around a year ago, sources familiar with the matter said.  TPG also led a $120 million investment round for security startup Tanium last year and was the lead investor in a $100 million funding round in internet security firm Zscaler. "

2013-10-23,3,"Perlmutter, who was passed over by Intel’s board for the job of chief executive officer earlier this year, will leave in February to pursue other opportunities, the company said in a filing on Wednesday. As Executive Vice President and General Manager, Intel Architecture Group, Perlmutter was sidelined in May after Brian Krzanich was appointed chief executive and quickly reorganized the chipmaker’s main product groups. The PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Perlmutter now answer directly to Krzanich, who previously ran Intel’s cutting-edge chip plants. Known affectionately within Intel and among friends as Dadi, Perlmutter joined the company in 1980 after graduating from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. A decade ago, he headed development of technology used in Intel’s Centrino platform, which led to the widespread adoption of Wifi technology that freed computer users from using cables to connect to the Internet. Before that, he led technology pushes that contributed to Intel’s Pentium processors. “A lot of the way people use their PCs today is due in no small part to the work Dadi did,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. During his career, Intel became a dominant chipmaker calling the shots in the PC industry. But in recent years, it has struggled to catch up with smaller rivals such as Qualcomm Inc  as smartphones and tablets gained popularity. An Israeli based at the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California headquarters, Perlmutter was also the company’s most senior Intel executive to be paid in Israeli shekels."

2014-01-15,3,"Intel said on Wednesday that providers of data-center services would begin offering their customers details about the Intel chips used to power their servers - helping those customers make better buying decisions. Intel controls nearly all of the server market and is determined not to cede ground to Advanced Micro Devices  and other companies developing energy-efficient server chips based on technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings. “Strengthening awareness of the quality, features and impact of Intel technologies within (cloud providers’) infrastructure highlights the challenge competing vendors and architectures will have,” Intel marketing director Raejeanne Skillern said in an interview. The “Intel Cloud Technology” campaign expands on an agreement last year with Amazon Web Services to provide the specifications about the various kinds of Intel chips used in services offered by AWS. Last week, Qualcomm Inc’s soon-to-be chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, said data centers presented an opportunity for the smartphone chipmaker and hinted that the company might develop components for low-power servers. Rackspace, Virtustream and other data center service providers have signed onto Intel’s cloud marketing campaign, the chipmaker said."
2014-02-03,-2,"The steps to push executives to perform better were the latest indication that Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, who took over almost a year ago, is streamlining the chipmaker in the face of slow demand. Performance-based equity awards for senior executives will no longer have a minimum value and can fall to zero if shareholder returns do not meet thresholds, Intel said in a letter to stockholders on Monday. As well, Intel will require its 350 most senior executives to own company stock. Under the previous policy, only the 50 most senior employees executives had to hold company stock. “One of the top priorities of new CEO Brian Krzanich is to further strengthen our culture of accountability, engagement, and empowerment,” Intel said in the letter. Since replacing previous CEO Paul Otellini in May 2013, Krzanich has made major changes, including plans to make Intel’s prized production lines broadly available to chip designers willing to pay, and reorganizing Intel’s business divisions to make them more accountable to him. Intel said it has no foreseeable plans to hand out retention grants to its senior leadership. In 2012, after Otellini announced plans to step down, Intel paid retention grants to a handful of its top executives to keep them from leaving at a sensitive time. Last year, Krzanich’s total compensation was $9.1 million, down from $15.7 million the year before, when he was chief operating officer and received a retention payment. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. In January, Intel said it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent as it realigns its focus to faster growing areas. As well as tablets and smartphones, Intel is keen to sell chips to be used in future devices like smart watches and other wearable computers. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future."

2017-01-11,-6,"By Jessica Toonkel Jan 11 (Reuters) - CNN, the news division of Time Warner Inc , said on Wednesday its decision to publish “carefully sourced reporting” on unverified intelligence documents concerning President-elect Donald Trump is “vastly different than BuzzFeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos.” CNN’s statement came after Trump called the news outlet “fake news” and refused to take a CNN reporter’s questions at his first formal news conference since his Nov. 8 electoral win. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published a story about a dossier of documents it said were unverified and “potentially unverifiable” allegations of contact between Trump aides and Russian operatives. Included in the documents were claims that Russian intelligence had compromising information about Trump. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti in a memo to employees on Wednesday defended the decision to publish the dossier, referring to it as a “newsworthy document.” Throughout the news conference, Trump decried a CNN report on Tuesday that said U.S. intelligence officials had presented Trump with claims that Russian operatives said they had compromising personal and financial information about him.

Intel has struggled to get a virtual television service off the ground, due to unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay, according to sources. It has kept its strategy to launch a TV service, based around a set-top box, under wraps for months."
2013-11-21,2,"“We’re going to go much further. If we can utilize our silicon to provide the best computing, we’ll do that,” Krzanich told analysts. “People who can use our leading edge and build computing capabilities that are better than anyone else‘s, those are good candidates for our foundry service.” Intel shares jumped more than 2.5 percent by the end of trading on Thursday. At his first annual investor day since taking over as chief executive in May, Krzanich said the slumping personal computer industry, Intel’s core market, was showing signs of bottoming out. “Our view is that it’s declining but it’s beginning to show signs of stabilization,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said global PC shipments are likely to decline slightly next year as consumers in emerging markets favor tablets. Intel’s revenues next year will be flat, with lower PC sales offsetting more server sales, he said. Krzanich said that during his six-month tenure as CEO, Intel improved its chip offerings for tablet makers. He pledged to quadruple the number of tablets with Intel chips in 2014. Tablets with Intel chips would range in price from less than $100 to more than $400, he said, adding he recently gave every Intel board member a $149 Android tablet made with an Intel chip to demonstrate the progress the company was making in mobile. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Intel shareholders and its board are betting that Krzanich, a veteran from Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing operation who replaced retiring CEO Paul Otellini, will be able to steer the company back on track. “When we began our search for the CEO a year ago ... I was embarrassed that we had lost our way,” Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said at the event. Krzanich pointed to SoFIA, a low-end version, as an example of Intel’s new pragmatism and willingness to change how it does business. He said that in the interest of speed, SoFIA would initially be manufactured outside of Intel, with the goal of bringing it to market next year. Intel will later move production of SoFIA chips to its own cutting-edge 14 nanometer manufacturing lines, Krzanich said. As PC sales shrink, Krzanich sees an opportunity to fill idle production lines while earning new revenue. Thursday’s announcement shows he is much more willing than his predecessor, Otellini, to open Intel’s factories to a wide range of companies, including potential competitors. “Wow,” Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note to clients. “It’s very refreshing to see Intel make this move and could have important implications for the industry.” Intel could end up acting as manufacturing components on behalf of rivals like graphics chipmaker Nvidia or even dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm, Mosesmann wrote. Those companies currently rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, or TSMC, the leading contract chip manufacturer, known in the industry as a foundry. “In foundry, we’re extending our capabilities and we’re open for business.” said Intel President Renee James, even with competitors, she added. Otellini agreed early this year for Intel to manufacture programmable chips on behalf of Altera, a Silicon Valley neighbor it does not compete with. That deal, seen as allowing Intel to eventually take on larger customers, spurred speculation that Intel could do a much bigger deal to make iPhone or iPad chips for Apple, which currently depends on Samsung to manufacture its chips. Responding to consumer preferences, Intel plans to drastically increase its investment in chips for the fast-growing tablet market while trimming investments in the company’s core PC processor business, Smith said. Shares of Intel closed up 2.7 percent at $25.23. "

2012-05-10,0,"With worldwide PC sales barely growing, Intel Corp  has been racing to find a foothold in smartphone and tablet markets, where processors based on ARM Holdings Pls’s  power-efficient chip designs are widely used. Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. Intel has also announced the Medfield chips would be used in upcoming phones from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc, Lenovo Group Ltd ZTE  and Orange. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring that the chipmaker is a serious player in the mobile market. But growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete have fueled gains in its shares in recent months. Intel is also heavily promoting a PC category it has dubbed ultrabooks, similar to Apple Inc’s Macbook Air and offering some of the technological chic the iPad and other tablets epitomize. Some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. They worry Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to help make ultrabooks affordable. Otellini said sales were on track and would pick up in the second half of 2012 as more manufacturers start using Intel’s new Ivy Bridge processor. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for the Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year. He also forecast that Intel, with its deep pockets, would become one of an increasingly smaller group of leading-edge chip manufacturers as the sector moves toward larger and costlier factories. With the industry preparing to increase the size of the silicon wafers it uses, letting manufacturers fit more chips on each, future leading-edge factories will cost over $10 billion each to build, compared with about $5 billion now, Otellini added."
2016-04-15,-1,"Intel is also looking to consolidate some operations and close some smaller outposts after a series of acquisitions Oregonlive said on Friday. The job cuts, which could also include top executive roles, could begin soon after the company reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, Oregonlive said. Intel, which had 107,300 employees as of Dec. 26, declined to comment. The company had said in 2014 it planned to reduce its global workforce by about 5 percent, or more than 5,000 positions, as it struggled with falling personal-computer sales and shifted focus to faster-growing areas. Last week Intel said two senior executives would leave. "
2014-01-14,-3,"The “Fab 42” facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, will remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Intel’s decision not open the chip plant was first reported by the Arizona Republic on Tuesday. “The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies,” Mulloy told Reuters. Despite not opening the new factory, or fab, Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1,000 employees since construction started in 2011, Mulloy said. Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people. Campaigning for re-election in 2012, Obama made a stop at the factory’s construction site, where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the United States. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it was caught offguard by smartphones and tablets, a computing revolution that has cut into demand for PCs, the company’s core business. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, the worst year since market research firm Gartner began tracking those products. “The newer fab has not been equipped with the capital equipment. It has heating and air conditioning but the actual tools, the expensive stuff, are not in there,” Mulloy said. Intel originally meant to install its most advanced manufacturing technology at the plant and make 14 nanometer microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin. Existing factories at the Chandler site using Intel’s previous generation of manufacturing, 22 nm, are being converted to also make chips at 14 nm and many of Intel’s new employees are working there, Mulloy said. “It boils down to better capital utilization,” Mulloy said."
2013-11-05,-1,"The Santa Clara, California chipmaker and other technology companies are betting that what they call the ‘Internet of Things’ - a trend toward connecting everything from bathroom scales to skyscraper ventilation systems via the Internet - will create massive demand for new electronics and software. As Intel strives to make sure it’s not caught off-guard by future technology trends, its new ‘Internet of Things Solutions Group’ will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, according to Doug Davis, the group’s general manager. “Krzanich is saying, ‘I want a higher level of focus on this to help us grow it and put the level of attention on it that it deserves,'” Davis told Reuters on Tuesday. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the personal computer industry but was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. A three-decade Intel manufacturing veteran who took over as CEO in May, Krzanich has made developing mobile chips a higher priority within Intel. In September, Krzanich announced that Intel was working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, along with an ingestible version for biomedical uses. The new solutions group combines an existing Intel business focused on chips for commercial and industrial devices with Intel’s Wind River subsidiary, which sells software for commercial and industrial devices. “We’re pulling together a couple of pieces that are already doing well and we want to accelerate those efforts. This creates a primary focus around ‘Internet of Things,'” Davis said."
2012-12-10,2,"The world’s largest chipmaker dominates the PC industry but has been slow to adapt its processors for mobile gadgets that depend on batteries and demand power efficiency. At an industry conference in San Francisco on Monday, Intel reported on the progress of its technology for making SoCs, or “systems-on-a-chip” with features measuring 22 nanometers. “Intel’s 22 nm SoC technology will be ready for high volume manufacturing in 2013,” Intel said in a copy of the presentation. Intel’s current mobile SoCs are manufactured at 32 nm, while Qualcomm makes its top-end SoCs at 28 nm and Nvidia uses 40 nm technology. Manufacturing chips with smaller features allows for better performance and power efficiency. Intel already makes PC processors at 22 nm, but since SoCs pack more features onto one piece of silicon, manufacturing them at 22 nm is more complicated, said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Analysis. “They (Intel) have all the right ingredients to make a very competitive mobile chip but we won’t know if they do until 2013,” Moorhead said. While Intel’s industry lead in manufacturing technology is well established, competitors and many on Wall Street say the chipmaker’s mobile SoC designs do not stand up to SoCs designed by Qualcomm, Apple and others with technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holdings."
2012-01-09,1,"“Our focus for 2012 is to drive awareness and demand for ultrabooks,” Kevin Sellers, Intel’s vice president of sales and marketing, told Reuters at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The chip maker’s “A New Era in Computing” campaign will span TV and print advertisements along with a push through social media. Intel, which on Monday announced a partnership with voice-technology firm Nuance (NUAN.O), also said it expects ultrabooks that respond to voice commands to be launched later this year, and laptops that respond to hand gestures soon. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is eager to make laptops more attractive to consumers increasingly captivated by Apple’s iPad, MacBook Air and other mobile gadgets. Its processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs but Intel has failed so far to adapt them for power-hungry smartphones and tablets. Manufacturers like Motorola (MMI.N) and Apple favor processors made using energy-efficient technology licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings ARM.L. More than 75 ultrabooks are due to be launched this year from various manufacturers, Mooly Eden, vice president of Intel’s PC group, said at CES. "
2014-02-03,-2,"Performance-based equity awards for senior executives will no longer have a minimum value and can fall to zero if shareholder returns do not meet thresholds, Intel said in a letter to stockholders on Monday. As well, Intel will require its 350 most senior executives to own company stock. Under the previous policy, only the 50 most senior employees executives had to hold company stock. “One of the top priorities of new CEO Brian Krzanich is to further strengthen our culture of accountability, engagement, and empowerment,” Intel said in the letter. Since replacing previous CEO Paul Otellini in May 2013, Krzanich has made major changes, including plans to make Intel’s prized production lines broadly available to chip designers willing to pay, and reorganizing Intel’s business divisions to make them more accountable to him. Intel said it has no foreseeable plans to hand out retention grants to its senior leadership. In 2012, after Otellini announced plans to step down, Intel paid retention grants to a handful of its top executives to keep them from leaving at a sensitive time. Last year, Krzanich’s total compensation was $9.1 million, down from $15.7 million the year before, when he was chief operating officer and received a retention payment. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. In January, Intel said it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent as it realigns its focus to faster growing areas. As well as tablets and smartphones, Intel is keen to sell chips to be used in future devices like smart watches and other wearable computers. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future. "
2016-04-22,1,"While revenue for its flagship cloud services business Azure more than doubled last quarter, the company said in Thursday’s earning report, the “intelligent cloud” division that includes it saw just 3 percent revenue growth in the period. And operating profits for the division dropped by 14 percent, in part reflecting non-cloud products included under its umbrella, such as traditional server software.       Chipmaker Intel has a less clear path to growth for its cloud operations, and investors have remained skeptical.   The company’s  share price is down about 1 percent over the last year, as software maker Microsoft’s stock rose about 30 percent. Microsoft’s market capitalization of around $440 billion is almost three times Intel’s at $151 billion, compared to about double five years ago. “Wintel” computers running Windows on Intel chips dominated the personal-computing era, which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops. Both Intel and Microsoft, run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella, are betting their businesses on the cloud. Graphic on Intel and Microsoft market value: here     At Intel, in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as it shifts away from the PC, data-center business revenue rose 9 percent to $4 billion. That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers, where the company says it is doing well. “There’s this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this (cloud) trend,” said Dan Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio. “Intel is still more drowned out,” meaning not as high-profile.  Microsoft’s best-known play in the cloud is Azure, a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers.  Azure is gaining ground on Amazon’s AWS unit, the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services. Azure commands about 10 percent of the $23 billion market, estimates Synergy Research, compared with AWS’ 31 percent.  Much of the difference in the companies’ fortunes boils down to Microsoft’s fundamental business as a software company versus Intel’s as a hardware company, said Nick Sturiale, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners.  Clients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel’s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group.  “The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,” said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest. Intel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips. In a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel’s “top to bottom” understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead.  “Always paranoid about the competition, always driving,” he said.  “And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.”	  Intel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off.   And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come.  Much of its “intelligent cloud” business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment’s name “is to align to the ambition” of  building the cloud. Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term “cloud” came up 59 times. In Intel’s call this week, it came up 11 times. "

Rochester, New York-based Vuzix develops computerized, Internet-connected glasses and other video eyewear aimed at consumers, businesses and entertainment. Intel officials were not immediately available for comment. Intel, which was slow to launch chips for smartphones and tablets, is striving to be at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing and expand into new markets, including smart watches and other Internet-connected “wearables”. A month ago, Italy’s Luxottica said it was joining forces with the US chipmaker to develop glasses that combine its top fashion brands with technology that could allow wearers to access information about their health or location.

Representatives from Intel and Verizon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Earlier this year, Intel decided it would launch an Internet TV service with live and on-demand content in a bid to find an alternative revenue stream as its core business of providing chips to computer makers erodes. It’s a crowded field as Apple Inc, Google Inc , Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp  jockey for position to own the living room through TV, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s streaming video services have millions of subscribers. Intel has also struggled to reach content deals with media companies."
2012-03-18,-3,"Intel, the world’s No.1 chipmaker, opened its $3.5 billion Fab 28 chip plant in the Israeli town of Kiryat Gat in 2008. Another $3 billion was invested in its move from producing processors with 45-nanometer circuitry to the more advanced 22-nanometer technology, Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told reporters on Sunday. The company, which employs 7,800 workers in Israel, expects to recruit more than 600 people in 2012 to its four development centres and two production facilities. Last year Intel began selling a new microchip, code-named Sandy Bridge, that was developed at Intel Israel’s development centre in Haifa together with teams in the United States. The 32-nanometer microchip accounted for over 40 percent of Intel’s revenue in 2011, with more than 150 million units shipped, said Mooly Eden, newly named president of Intel Israel. Eden said the Haifa centre had a central role in developing the next-generation processor, called Ivy Bridge, which will be produced with 22-nanometer technology. Marketing of Ivy Bridge will begin in the first half. Fassberg said no decision had been made about building a new plant in Israel, with talks on the matter continuing. “Intel makes decisions about increased production capacity when it needs it.”"
2014-04-07,-1,"Revenue from Intel’s phone and tablet chip businesses was previously included under the Other Intel Architecture segment. In addition, results from the gateway and set-top box business will be included as part of the PC Client Group instead of Other Intel Architecture, Intel said in a statement. The Data Center segment will include communications infrastructure results, which also previously were included under Other Intel Architecture. The Internet of Things Group, created late last year, combined Intel’s business focused on chips for commercial and industrial devices with its Wind River subsidiary, which sells software for commercial and industrial devices. The PC Client Group, which accounts for the biggest chunk of Intel’s revenue, will now include results from the gateway and set-top box business. Intel’s first-quarter report next week will include retrospective results for the updated business segments. "
2014-01-15,2,"Intel controls nearly all of the server market and is determined not to cede ground to Advanced Micro Devices and other companies developing energy-efficient server chips based on technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings. “Strengthening awareness of the quality, features and impact of Intel technologies within (cloud providers’) infrastructure highlights the challenge competing vendors and architectures will have,” Intel marketing director Raejeanne Skillern said in an interview. The “Intel Cloud Technology” campaign expands on an agreement last year with Amazon Web Services to provide the specifications about the various kinds of Intel chips used in services offered by AWS. Last week, Qualcomm Inc’s soon-to-be chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, said data centers presented an opportunity for the smartphone chipmaker and hinted that the company might develop components for low-power servers. Rackspace, Virtustream and other data center service providers have signed onto Intel’s cloud marketing campaign, the chipmaker said. "
2017-01-09,-8,"“Attention has recently focused on the potential exploitation of the cyber domain by other states and associated actors for political purposes,” said Margaret Beckett, chair of parliament’s joint committee on national security strategy. “But this is just one source of threat that the government must address,” she added, in a statement. Cyber attacks in the UK have been on the rise, with businesses such as banks and retailers increasingly becoming targets for hackers. Reported attacks on financial institutions in Britain rose from just five in 2014 to 75 in the year to October 2016, data from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) show. Last year, retailer Tesco’s banking arm suffered an attack which saw some 2.5 million pounds stolen from 9,000 current accounts. The inquiry will look at issues including the types of cyber threats faced by the UK, the extent of human, financial and technical capital committed to address threats, and the development of offensive cyber capabilities. The inquiry forms part of the second National Cyber Security Strategy launched in November last year, which has a total budget of 1.9 billion pounds running from 2016 to 2021. "
2012-04-17,8,"Shaky economies in Europe and the United States, a growing consumer preference for tablets, and a recent shortage of hard drives due to flooding in Thailand have taken a toll on the PC industry. Still, demand in China and other emerging economies has helped sustain PC growth, and Intel’s server business has been a winner from the buildout of servers behind the Internet and data consumed on smartphones. “Given the topline is slightly better than expected, it doesn’t seem like there’s a meaningful impact from tablets right now. The PC market is holding up pretty well,” said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at CLSA. Despite weakness in the United States, global PC shipments in the first quarter grew 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, research firm Gartner said last week. That was better than the firm’s previous forecast of a 1.2 percent decline. Hoping to safeguard its position in PCs, Intel is heavily promoting a new class of instant-on, super-thin laptops dubbed “ultrabooks” that it hopes can stand up to the likes of Apple Inc’s Macbook Air, with some of the technological chic the iPad and other tablets epitomize. An upcoming launch of Intel’s newest PC processor, called Ivy Bridge, is expected to boost the company’s sales later this year, as is the launch of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 operating system later in 2012. Intel has struggled to find a foothold in smartphones and tablets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power-efficient chip designs are widely used. But Intel has recently shown some encouraging signs with announcements that its newest processors would be used in a handful of upcoming smartphones. Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring the chipmaker a serious player in the mobile market. But growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete in mobile have fueled some of the gain in its shares in recent months. The long-time technology bellwether said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $13.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Ahead of Intel’s earnings report, some analysts said they were optimistic the company would beat their own estimates. The long-awaited Windows 8 is expected to cause a jump in PC sales, but the operating system will be Microsoft’s first version of Windows that is compatible with chips designed by ARM Holdings, a rival of Intel. Intel could face new competition in low-end PCs from companies like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm. The world’s leading chipmaker said revenue in the first quarter was $12.9 billion, up from $12.85 billion in the year-ago period and a bit higher than the $12.85 billion expected. GAAP net income in the first quarter was $2.74 billion, down from $3.16 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 53 cents, better than the 50 cents expected. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter would be 63 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points. Despite the relatively upbeat outlook, shares of Intel fell 2.81 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.23 percent at $28.47 on Nasdaq. "

2012-04-06,-7,"Federal prosecutors in Boston had alleged that Biswamohan Pani, 36, downloaded some of Intel’s “most valuable” design and manufacturing documents in June 2008, in his final days as an engineer in a Massachusetts facility. Intel was not aware at the time of the alleged downloads that Pani had already sought a position and begun working at Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s largest rival in the chip industry. Pani acted alone and there was no evidence that he was instructed by AMD to carry out the theft - nor was AMD aware of his actions, prosecutors said. In court filings, Intel estimated the company secrets to be worth at least $200 million to $400 million. AMD fired Pani in 2008. “AMD was not accused of wrongdoing, and the FBI has stated that there is no evidence that AMD had any involvement in or awareness of Mr. Pani’s alleged actions,” said Drew Prairie, a spokesman for AMD.

2015-06-01,-1,"Intel’s biggest acquisition ever will let the Santa Clara, California company offer twice the computing power when its Xeon processors used in servers are combined with Altera’s programmable chips. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits. “This whole deal is defensive for the datacenter,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who saw it as an admission by Intel that it was getting harder to drive performance gains. He questioned Intel’s projections for the programmable chip market, which is built on datacenter use and growing adoption of Intel chips in everyday objects connected to the Internet. “I think their growth goals are ludicrous,” he said. “They think it’s going to grow 7 percent a year, but Altera shrunk 2 percent a year in the last three years.” Still, big data companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft are all tweaking their servers to get their datacenters to run faster and more efficiently. Microsoft has tried using programmable chips combined with Intel’s Xeon processors. Altera’s chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), can be configured as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “You can put your software down into the silicon,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich told CNBC in an interview. Intel, which analysts estimate has more than 90 percent of the datacenter market, already has an agreement to use Altera chips. Its move comes as companies such as Qualcomm  Inc, using ARM Holdings -designed chips and the soon-to-be merged Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corp , also target the datacenter market. By buying Altera, Intel avoids the risk of being dropped as the smaller company’s manufacturing partner, which had been the subject of some speculation, said Gartner analyst Mark Hung. The purchase means Intel is hedging against the likelihood that the rise of FPGA chips will reduce the need for central processing unit (CPU) chips running servers, where Intel currently dominates. “This way Intel will profit if customers use FPGAs instead of CPUs,” said FBR Capital markets analyst Christopher Rolland. “Intel will be the only company that will be able to combine x86 server CPUs with FPGAs onto a single die. This could eventually be a $1 billion market, with the lion’s share going to Intel.”   (Reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore, Bill Rigby in Seattle, Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Diane Craft)"
2014-05-17,6,"But smartwatches and fitness bands launched by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other tech companies in the past year have yet to really take off. At the Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, Krzanich told Reuters that successful smart clothes will come from individual inventors focused on their own needs. “The trick to making the perfect wearable is going to be when you figure out what problems you’re trying to solve, and I don’t think you’re going to be able to build a wearable that does it all for everyone,” he said. “Who better to design the next athletic wearable than an athlete,” added Krzanich. Thousands of people attended the open-air event, which gives hobbyists and their families a chance to socialize and check out other people’s projects. Among the most popular attractions were demonstrations of flying drones, voice-activated robots and a giant metal octopus shooting fire from its tentacles. Intel is not the only technology company to look to the growing maker movement for inspiration but it has been among the most aggressive. Intel, ARM Holdings, Atmel and other chipmakers all have exhibitions at the weekend event to make sure that hobbyists are up to speed on their latest components. ”“These are the future engineers, the future scientists, the guys who will be inventing the next companies that create great products, whether it’s the next Google or Apple. We want them to be aware of Intel technology,” Krzanich said. Intel has set aside over $1 million in awards for contests for people to pitch ideas for wearable gadgets made with Intel technology. Even if Intel becomes a major supplier of chips for wearable and mobile devices, it is unclear whether that business could make up for the slowdown in the PC industry, which Intel has dominated for four decades. Intel has also lagged far behind Qualcomm in smartphones. But the push into wearables is a major prong in Krzanich’s goal to see Intel’s chips used across a range of new markets. Last year, Intel launched Galileo, the chipmaker’s version of the Arduino microcontroller board widely used by hobbyists as the brains in everything from robots to electronic cocktail mixers. "

2015-04-30,-7,"Earlier this month, Altera rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, the sources said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. They said Altera agreed to engage in these talks on the basis that Intel would not go public with any offer until June.  In February, Intel discussed offering $58 per share for Altera, based on publicly available information it reviewed at the time, according to the people. After signing a non-disclosure agreement and combing through non-public information, including the company’s outlook, it ended up revising down its offer, they said. Last week, Altera posted a sequential 9 percent decline in revenue for the first quarter and said it also expects weakness in its second-quarter guidance, particularly around its wireless business. It is unclear whether Intel would take its proposal directly to shareholders, the sources said, but it remains an option available to it.  Intel and Altera both declined to comment.

2014-05-17,5,"With sales of smartphones losing steam, technology companies including Intel believe that wearable computing devices - a still undefined category including smart watches, fitness trackers and Google Glass - could become a major trend in personal computing. But smartwatches and fitness bands launched by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other tech companies in the past year have yet to really take off. At the Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, Krzanich told Reuters that successful smart clothes will come from individual inventors focused on their own needs. “The trick to making the perfect wearable is going to be when you figure out what problems you’re trying to solve, and I don’t think you’re going to be able to build a wearable that does it all for everyone,” he said. “Who better to design the next athletic wearable than an athlete,” added Krzanich. Thousands of people attended the open-air event, which gives hobbyists and their families a chance to socialize and check out other people’s projects. Among the most popular attractions were demonstrations of flying drones, voice-activated robots and a giant metal octopus shooting fire from its tentacles. Krzanich is a weekend tinkerer in his own right and just finished restoring a 1974 Land Cruiser. Intel is not the only technology company to look to the growing maker movement for inspiration but it has been among the most aggressive. Intel, ARM Holdings, Atmel and other chipmakers all have exhibitions at the weekend event to make sure that hobbyists are up to speed on their latest components. ”“These are the future engineers, the future scientists, the guys who will be inventing the next companies that create great products, whether it’s the next Google or Apple. We want them to be aware of Intel technology,” Krzanich said. Intel has set aside over $1 million in awards for contests for people to pitch ideas for wearable gadgets made with Intel technology. Even if Intel becomes a major supplier of chips for wearable and mobile devices, it is unclear whether that business could make up for the slowdown in the PC industry, which Intel has dominated for four decades. Intel has also lagged far behind Qualcomm in smartphones. But the push into wearables is a major prong in Krzanich’s goal to see Intel’s chips used across a range of new markets. Last year, Intel launched Galileo, the chipmaker’s version of the Arduino microcontroller board widely used by hobbyists as the brains in everything from robots to electronic cocktail mixers.

2012-01-19,-5,"Adding to its troubles, Intel has failed to find a foothold in smartphones and tablets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power efficient chip designs are widely used. Rushing to speed up its development of competitive chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel said it would boost capital expenditures in 2012 to $12.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million. Last year its capital expenditures were $10.7 billion. “The biggest surprise is the capex for the new year,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “They’re investing to catch up and not only be at parity but exceed where the handset incumbents are.” Lenovo and Motorola Mobility have agreed to use Intel’s new Medfield chip in upcoming smartphones, and investors are keen to see how the new devices do with consumers. Intel’s main PC client group raised its revenue 17 percent in the December quarter to $9 billion. Its revenues from selling server chips for data centers rose 8 percent. After flooding in Thailand ruined factories and sensitive machinery, shortages of the components are expected to persist through the first half of 2012 and disrupt PC production. “Last quarter they underestimated the flood impact. I am wondering if they are still underestimating the Thailand flood impact, and the market’s ability to ramp back up to get to these numbers,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. Upbeat earnings forecasts by Linear Technology, Xilinx and TSMC this week have made investors cautiously optimistic that a drawdown of inventories in the broader chip industry, including semiconductores used in automobiles, communications and factories, may be ending, clearing the way for higher sales. Fears of falling PC sales hurt the shares of Microsoft, Dell Inc and Intel for much of 2011. Intel’s stock has recovered over the past three months, partly due to the chipmaker’s relatively high 3.3 percent dividend yield. Still trading at a modest 10.8 times expected earnings, the shares recently hit a 52-week high. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected current-quarter revenue of $12.770 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The world’s leading chipmaker said revenue in the fourth quarter was $13.9 billion, up 21 percent and slightly higher than the $13.718 billion expected. GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion, up 6 percent. GAAP earnings per share were 64 cents. Analysts had expected 61 cents. Intel had a gross margin of 64 percent in the fourth quarter, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 65 percent. Analysts on average expected 64.6 percent. Shares of Intel were unchanged after its earnings report from a close of $25.63, up 0.95 percent on Nasdaq. "

2013-01-31,-7,"It joined PC maker Acer Inc in Bangkok to unveil the Liquid C1 smartphone, a $330 device running Google Inc’s  Android operating system, which will be launched first in Thailand and then rolled out across Southeast Asia, one of the fastest-growing markets for mobile phones. “We’ve made a conscious effort to go after these fast-growing markets as our first foray into the business,” Mike Bell, who heads Intel’s mobile division said in a telephone interview. The company’s ninth such device in nine months, the Liquid C1 represents how far Intel has come in convincing bigger name manufacturers to take a chance with its mobile chips as the sales of personal computers and laptops plunge. But analysts say it also shows how far it still has to go to get a foothold in a  market dominated by the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp. “First and foremost they have to prove they can play in this space at all,” said Scott Bicheno, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. “There’s no obvious technical fault with Intel’s chips. It’s just that the incumbents are very well established.” Intel has little choice but to get into mobile. It saw revenue fall 3 percent in the last quarter on weak sales of PCs, part of a steady decline in revenue growth since 2009. It has also watched as devices like Apple Inc’s  iPad cannibalise sales of PCs. So, in the past year, the company has launched phones with Intel chips in Europe, Africa, Latin America, Russia, India and China. Some were effectively designed and built by Intel as what it calls “calling cards”, convincing carriers like Orange to brand and offer the phones on their own networks in France and the United Kingdom. Last year, it persuaded Chinese hardware manufacturers like ZTE Corp  and Lenovo Group Ltd to build their own phones with Intel chips. Sales have not been stellar. Intel declined to share data, as did ZTE and Lenovo. But Melissa Chau, senior research manager at technology research group IDC, said while Lenovo shipped more than 1 million units of its best-selling phone in China in the third quarter of last year, it shipped only about 20,000 of its first Intel phone, the K800. “That’s the scale we’re talking here,” she said. In the past year or so, however, Intel seems to have shifted focus to mobile applications. It acquired Infineon Technologies’ wireless chip business in 2011 and hired and promoted phone experts like Bell. “These guys are phone specialists and they’ve really turned us around in terms of of the way we approach the market, the way we approach design,” said Uday Marty, managing director for Intel in Southeast Asia. It seems to be working, at least in terms of quality. UK-based Bicheno says the Motorola RAZR i phone that he has been using, which has an Intel chip, performs as well as any other Android phone. “They’ve learned a huge amount about the mobile world and how different it is, through their years of failures,” said Caroline Gabriel, head of research at consultancy Rethink Wireless. “Intel did not understand the process of getting devices onto carrier networks in the past, but it does now.” Intel has several aces up its sleeve. For one thing, it has longstanding relationships with the likes of Acer, Lenovo and Asustek Computer Inc, all of whom are in a similar predicament: as PC makers, they all need to grow their mobile business. But even then, they have been slow jumping aboard. Industry sources in Taiwan said that Intel had offered extensive lures to try its mobile chips. Intel executives acknowledged they had shouldered some costs but said it did not extend as far as  buying a production line of the PC makers. Intel, too, has used its experience in optimising its computers chips for Microsoft Windows software to work closely with Google on making Android run well on its devices. “We are not just investing in chips, we’re investing heavily in the software to run around them,” said Bell. This would doom it to playing a high-volume, low-margin game against low-cost chip makers in Taiwan like Mediatek. Intel counters that it is targeting the $200-$500 segment because that’s where a lot of the growth is, and that it intends to eventually offer chips that, like its PC chips, range across all price points. Intel executives also say they Will be offering a chip either later this year or early in 2014 that works on the 4G LTE networks already deployed in the United States and currently being rolled out in Europe. The problem there, says Gabriel of Rethink Wireless, is that it will then be lagging the likes of Qualcomm and STElectronics. Another concern is whether Intel can move beyond its usual partners. Persuading the likes of Acer and Lenovo to push out a smartphone is one thing, analysts say, but what about established phone makers like HTC Corp, let alone dominant players Samsung and Apple? Only then would Intel be able to get the volumes necessary for decent margins. In the long run, analysts said, a company with the resources of Intel had a reasonable chance of building at least some business in mobile. “Given Intel’s vast resources, I am not one to easily discount their ability to get into any market that they target,” said Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst at the IHS research firm. And as Intel’s Bell points out, the rapid fall of players like BlackBerry and Nokia, and the equally rapid rise of Samsung and Apple, suggest that just because Intel is a bit player now, it may not always be. “I was at a different firm building phones a couple of years ago and the company that was going to dominate Earth was RIM,” said Bell, who has worked at both Palm and Apple. He was referring to the Blackberry maker that has seen market share slip heavily in the past few years. “We’ll see two years from now who’s the market leader.”"

2012-06-08,-7,"* Media heavyweights to work with Intel * Plans call for year-end launch; still no content deals By Yinka Adegoke and Noel Randewich NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, June 8 (Reuters) - Intel is counting on facial-recognition technology for targeted ads and a team of veteran entertainment dealmakers to win over reluctant media partners for its new virtual television service. But so far it’s proving a challenge to get the service off the ground, thanks to an unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business. According to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising. The set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said. Intel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc.  - is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs. While none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices. “If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. Intel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age. For its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners. “They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks. An Intel representative declined to comment for this story. Chip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted. BEYOND PCs While Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential. According to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smarpthones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers -- which typically also use Intel chips. Intel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. According to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component. The biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners. Intel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license. “Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. To change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney. In addition to Huggers and Ancier, sources said, two other names prominent in TV circles have emerged as consultants for Intel: entertainment lawyer Ken Ziffren and former MTV executive Nicole Browning. Browning, who previously negotiated on the other side of the table for MTV, has been handling some of the talks with partners, sources said. Ziffren built his reputation representing Hollywood talent - he was instrumental in negotiating the deal that returned the “Tonight Show” to Jay Leno. Lesser known is his firm’s work negotiating deals for DirecTV’s video-on-demand service and carriage agreements for pay-TV network Starz. But even that quartet of executives may not be enough to resolve an intractable problem, which is that content companies have little incentive to offer their channels to Intel at a discount and Intel is loathe to pay a premium. “They’d love a better deal but they won’t get one,” said Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin of Intel. “The industry has always worked on volume discounts.” Underscoring the difficulty insurgent tech companies face in securing content, Microsoft in January indefinitely postponed plans for its own online TV subscription service after deciding that licensing costs were too high, according to people familiar with those discussions. And therein lies that dilemma that Intel and other insurgent over-the-top providers must tackle before their big plans can be realized."
2014-10-14,-2,"The Santa Clara, California-based company on Tuesday reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street’s expectations, helped by a recovery in personal computers, by far its largest market.  Progress in Intel’s smartphone and tablet strategy was less clear. The mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion for the September quarter, worse than a $810 million loss the year before.  The company in recent years was slow to recognize the significance of the smartphone revolution, and CEO Brain Krzanich, who took over in 2012, has accelerated efforts to catch up by subsidizing costs for tablet manufacturers that use its chips. Smartphones and tablets account for a tiny fraction of Intel’s business, but the company sees staking out territory in mobile as key to emerging markets such as  wearable computing products.   Intel is using its deep pockets to help it reach its goal to see its chips used in at least 40 million tablets this year, up from 10 million in 2013. The vast majority of smartphones and tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc Britain’s ARM Holdings ARM.L. Intel’s subsidies are meant to reduce the burden to manufacturers of designing tablets with Intel’s current chips, which require more expensive memory and other components that it says drive up costs. Intel says its future chips will be more cost-effective for manufacturers and will not need subsidies in order to sell.  “The strategy is that over time, we think we can give better performance, more features in that segment of the market and so we wanted to start the work of building our footprint,” Intel CFO Stacy Smith said in a phone interview. Besides tablet subsidies, Intel’s mobile and communications group is feeling the pinch from slower sales of 2G and 3G chips as cellphone makers move to more advanced 4G technology.

The job reductions may include retirements, voluntary programs and other options, Kraeuter said, adding that Intel’s typical annual attrition worldwide is about 4 percent. He declined to say whether details of the changes had been announced internally. On a conference call with analysts on Thursday after the earnings release, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith alluded to a reduction in employment this year and said that Intel would increase investments in areas such as data center technology, low-power chips and tablets. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. “If they’ve got a bunch or resources in a market that may not be dead but is not growing a ton, it probably makes sense to reprioritize those investments in areas where there are fast-growing markets,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Intel has both added and shed significant numbers of jobs over the past decade. Struggling to fend off a challenge by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in 2006, Intel announced it would reduce its workforce by over 10,000 positions, but its overall number of employees has grown since then. The chipmaker is also not the only tech company to trim its workforce because of slowing demand for PCs since Apple’s iPad started to cut into demand for laptops in 2010. Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a years-long internal restructuring that would ultimately see it shed 34,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce, through fiscal 2014. Dell succeeded last year in taking itself off public markets, allowing CEO and founder Michael Dell to restructure away from Wall Street’s scrutiny. That overhaul is expected to encompass layoffs. Earlier this week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. In its report on Thursday, Intel forecast March-quarter restructuring charges of $200 million, a portion of which could be earmarked for severance pay. Last September, Intel said it would close an old factory in Massachusetts, eliminating about 700 jobs. Intel has said it plans to quadruple tablet chip volume this year to 40 million units and aggressively stake out market share ahead of future mobile chip launches. Essentially buying its way into tablets, Intel plans to subsidize its customers’ engineering and manufacturing expenses, effectively reducing its gross margins in 2014 by 1.5 percentage points. Shares of Intel closed 2.6 percent lower at $25.85 on the Nasdaq on Friday. They earlier traded down as low as $25.25. "

2012-07-17,-7,"The world’s leading chipmaker on Tuesday cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth.” That put Intel’s outlook in line with many investors’ recently reduced expectations and helped cushion a sell-off of its stock. “As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched,” said Craig Ellis, an analyst at Caris & Company. “The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance - but they didn‘t.” Fears that global PC sales may be worse than expected have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April. Intel’s stock has recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said consumer spending in Europe and the United States is softer than previously thought. “At the beginning of the year we would have expected, along with most economists, that economic growth would start picking up and that would lead to an increase in consumer sales. Those expectations are now more muted,” Smith said in an interview after Intel posted its second-quarter earnings. Revenue rose to $13.5 billion from $13.03 billion in the year-ago period, but fell short of the $13.56 billion expected. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $14.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GAAP net income fell to $2.8 billion from $2.95 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 54 cents, below analysts’ average forecast of 52 cents. Intel’s report came after its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N last week slashed its outlook for second-quarter revenue on disappointing sales in Europe and China, where economic growth has recently lost some steam. “Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call.

2012-06-01,6,"Intel is counting on the super-thin laptops, a category it has dubbed ultrabooks, to add some pizzazz to a PC market languishing due to the growing popularity of Apple Inc’s  iPad. Combining the best of laptops and tablets, the ultrabooks will have large, touch screens, “instant on” responsiveness and razor-thin dimensions - all expensive features that have left some on Wall Street wondering if they might be too expensive for average consumers. Engineers at Intel’s Dupont, Washington R&D center, including former Boeing Co employees, have come up with a design method to make plastic laptop cases as strong as more expensive metal ones. That may cut the cost of future ultrabooks by between $25 and $75, said Ben Broili, head of the team. Their work is an example of the steps Intel is taking to find ways to make future ultrabooks more affordable - without cutting the prices of its processors. At a meeting with analysts last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said ultrabooks would be available for as little as $699, but many are expected to be priced nearer to $1,000. Borrowing from the aerospace industry, the engineers have found that hard drives, motherboards and other components that make up the guts of a PC can be laid out in ways that make the laptops structure much stronger. “We didn’t develop a new material. We are able to use an existing plastic with an existing manufacturing technology,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. “It just requires some more upfront thought initially about how you lay your system out and how you can bring these things together and tie them in.” Different components in the laptop can be leveraged to support its chassis, or even dissipate heat from the processor, he said. “There is no one size fits all,” Broili added. “We’re trying to enable the entire industry. You can make trades, move stuff around; and if you don’t want your hard drive here, then move it. You have a menu you can pick from and see what you win or lose from a cost and quality standpoint.” To get an idea of the structural quality of any laptop, Broili recommends lifting it up by a front corner while it is open and watching how much it flexes. Intel has already held a seminar in Taiwan to demonstrate its new design technique to PC design engineers and it is promoting it with specific manufacturers. At the Computex technology show in Taipei, Taiwan, next week, PC manufactures are set to unveil dozens of ultrabooks using Intel’s newest Ivy Bridge processors. They will also demonstrate future models with touch screens, based on Microsoft Corps’s Windows 8 platform, which is expected out later this year. Broili said Intel engineers are working on other ways to improve ultrabooks, including tweaks to motherboards, touch screens and Wifi. Separately, Intel launched a $300 million fund last year to invest in small companies focused on technologies complementing ultrabooks, such as improved battery life. A few ultrabook models launched this year have been reviewed as nice but pricey, leaving some analysts skeptical the category will attract mainstream shoppers. Otellini has said Intel is on track to reach its goal that  ultrabooks account for 40 percent of all consumer notebooks  sold by the end of the year."
2015-06-12,-5,"“It looks as if the deal is postponed for now,” an investor who attended the roadshow said. “The company doesn’t need to rush it to the market and is not willing to pay up given the market volatility. It will likely be back later this summer after it announces earnings and the market settles.” The company was targeting eight- and 15-year euro tranches, a 20-year sterling piece and various US dollar maturities, according to the investor. He expected the euro and sterling portions to total USD4bn with the remainder in US dollars. Intel hired Barclays and JP Morgan to hold a European roadshow from Wednesday June 3 to Friday June 5 ahead of a potential benchmark euro- and/or sterling-denominated deal. The European corporate market has crumbled under the pressure of continued rates volatility over recent weeks, forcing potential issuers either to swallow the chunky premiums required or delay and run the risk of hitting the summer lull. A mere EUR500m was raised this week, making it the slowest week for European corporate bond issuance since July last year. A source close to the deal said Intel is now waiting until after its earnings announcement on July 15 to sell the deal. Intel revealed at the beginning of the month that it would purchase programmable chip-maker Altera Corp for USD17bn. “They wanted to do about half of their planned total debt funding for the Altera acquisition, and the additional USD7.5bn to USD8.5bn funding needed will come from cash on Intel’s balance sheet,” the investor said. Intel is rated A1/A+/A+ (all stable).   (Reporting By Laura Benitez, editing by Helene Durand, Julian Baker)"
2013-02-25,-1,"Intel will make Altera’s programmable chips using its upcoming 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology, the most notable agreement of its kind announced so far by the chipmaker. “It’s a step in terms of building into a business level we wish to achieve,” Sunit Rikhi, Vice President and General Manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters on Monday. “There’s no doubt in my mind the foundry will be a significant player in the future.” Building new generations of chip manufacturing plants is becoming more and more expensive, and Intel has said in the past it was willing to open its facilities to carefully selected customers - as long as doing so does not its help competitors. Intel has announced agreements to manufacture on behalf of Achronix Semiconductor Corp and other small chipmakers but Monday’s announcement with Altera, one of two leading programmable chipmakers, is potentially much larger. “They’ve crossed over the line from it just being a questionable experiment to - we’re going to do this for tier-1 customers,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. With Intel struggling to find its footing in smarpthones and tablets with its own processor designs, some investors believe Intel may eventually agree to make Apple’s processors for the iPhone and iPad. “If and when we are called upon to serve large mobile customers who can drive a lot more volume, we could serve them today in terms of capability,” Rikhi said. “I‘m confident we have a very strong platform of offering upon which we can scale.” He declined to discuss Apple specifically. Intel has kept its own fabs and invested heavily in them over decades, resulting in a lead in manufacturing know-how that allows it to make chips that in some respects are more advanced than products from rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Altera Chief Executive John Daane told Reuters in a phone interview that Altera, which depends on communications infrastructure for about half of its business, is the only major programmable chipmaker that will have access to Intel’s plants. “We are essentially getting access like an extra division of Intel. As soon as they’re making the technology available to their various groups to do design work, we’re getting the same,” he said. Daane said Intel’s manufacturing technology will give Altera’s chips a several-year advantage against Xilinx, its main competitor in programmable chips. He said Altera would continue to make other chips with TSMC, its long-time foundry. Shares of Altera were unchanged in extended trading after closing down 0.96 percent at $35.01. Xilinx was down about 0.9 percent at $37, versus a close of $37.30 on the Nasdaq. Intel’s stock was up 0.49 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.93 percent at $20.23. "
2014-06-18,-1,"With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel. Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook.  It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want.  Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings.  The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,” Bryant said. Intel already sells server products that combine Xeon chips and programmable chips but on the new component they will be much more closely integrated, resulting in up to double the performance, Bryant said. She declined to say when Intel would sell the new product, how much they would cost or what company would supply the programmable chip, a technology distinct from Intel’s focus on processors. Programmable chips are typically used by manufacturers making small quantities of products or prototypes that do not warrant the expense of designing a new chip from the ground up. On Wall Street they are used to run complex financial simulations. Microsoft has already been experimenting with using programmable chips to help power its Bing web search engine. Intel announced in March it was expanding its existing contract manufacturing relationship with programmable chipmaker Altera to develop future components that combine different kinds of chips. Bryant said that arrangement was unrelated to the upcoming Xeon offering.  "

2014-05-27,1,"Intel gains access to Rockchip’s ability to quickly launch inexpensive mobile chips as well as access to the company’s strong relationships with local Chinese manufacturers focused on the country’s fast-growing consumer market.  “They’re absolutely bringing us speed and execution and proliferation for us that would not otherwise get done,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. “They also bring these relationships and partnerships that go well beyond what ours are.”  With sales of high-end mobile devices losing steam in North America, manufacturers have been turning their attention to lower-end tablets and smartphones designed for consumers in China. Under the agreement, Rockchip and Intel will make a quad-core mobile chip using Intel’s architecture and branding, Intel said. While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips,” or SoCs, that combine features like modems, wifi and memory.  Fuzhou, China-based Rockchip and other mobile chipmakers focus on making SoCs for smartphones and tablets. Those chips typically include ARM processor technology that competes against Intel’s technology. Krzanich said the agreement with Rockchip does not include an investment between the two companies. Intel said the chip will include 3G connectivity and be available in the first half of 2015. Shares of Intel were up 1.22 percent at $26.60, in line with trading levels ahead of the announcement. "
2012-06-13,-4,"“It’s probably true in the digital TV space because if you think about it, the content that is going to be served to these devices is extraordinary,” he said on Wednesday. “It’s increasingly high-def digital content, so it’s got to be driving a pretty significant buildout of the storage infrastructure and server infrastructure that supports all those devices.” The opportunity is not limited to home entertainment. Digital signs, tablets and cars are among other areas increasingly connected to the Internet, fueling demand for more Intel chips, he said. Smith’s comments come as Intel puts together a TV service that includes a set-top box employing technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising, according to sources. Smith would not discuss Intel’s specific plans for the TV service. Intel already makes processors for set-top boxes. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smartphones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers -- which typically also use Intel chips. Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs but growth in that market has been slowing as more consumers turn to tablets. A sovereign debt crisis has shaken investor and consumer confidence in Europe, forcing Cisco and other major technology companies to scale back expectations for IT spending there. Last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini played down those concerns and said the quarter was playing out as expected. Smith emphasized China and other markets where PC sales are growing faster than in developed markets, saying a weak Europe is a “baseline” presumption for Intel.

2013-01-31,-7,"“We’ve made a conscious effort to go after these fast-growing markets as our first foray into the business,” Mike Bell, who heads Intel’s mobile division said in a telephone interview. The company’s ninth such device in nine months, the Liquid C1 represents how far Intel has come in convincing bigger name manufacturers to take a chance with its mobile chips as the sales of personal computers and laptops plunge. But analysts say it also shows how far it still has to go to get a foothold in a market dominated by the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp. “First and foremost they have to prove they can play in this space at all,” said Scott Bicheno, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. “There’s no obvious technical fault with Intel’s chips. It’s just that the incumbents are very well established.” Intel has little choice but to get into mobile. It saw revenue fall 3 percent in the last quarter on weak sales of PCs, part of a steady decline in revenue growth since 2009. It has also watched as devices like Apple Inc’s iPad cannibalize sales of PCs. So, in the past year, the company has launched phones with Intel chips in Europe, Africa, Latin America, Russia, India and China. Some were effectively designed and built by Intel as what it calls “calling cards”, convincing carriers like Orange to brand and offer the phones on their own networks in France and the United Kingdom. Last year, it persuaded Chinese hardware manufacturers like ZTE Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd to build their own phones with Intel chips. Sales have not been stellar. Intel declined to share data, as did ZTE and Lenovo. But Melissa Chau, senior research manager at technology research group IDC, said while Lenovo shipped more than 1 million units of its best-selling phone in China in the third quarter of last year, it shipped only about 20,000 of its first Intel phone, the K800. “That’s the scale we’re talking here,” she said. In the past year or so, however, Intel seems to have shifted focus to mobile applications. It acquired Infineon Technologies’ wireless chip business in 2011 and hired and promoted phone experts like Bell. “These guys are phone specialists and they’ve really turned us around in terms of  the way we approach the market, the way we approach design,” said Uday Marty, managing director for Intel in Southeast Asia. It seems to be working, at least in terms of quality. UK-based Bicheno says the Motorola RAZR iphone that he has been using, which has an Intel chip, performs as well as any other Android phone. “They’ve learned a huge amount about the mobile world and how different it is, through their years of failures,” said Caroline Gabriel, head of research at consultancy Rethink Wireless. “Intel did not understand the process of getting devices onto carrier networks in the past, but it does now.” Intel has several aces up its sleeve. For one thing, it has longstanding relationships with the likes of Acer, Lenovo and Asustek Computer Inc, all of whom are in a similar predicament: as PC makers, they all need to grow their mobile business. But even then, they have been slow jumping aboard. Industry sources in Taiwan said that Intel had offered extensive lures to try its mobile chips. Intel executives acknowledged they had shouldered some costs but said it did not extend as far as buying a production line of the PC makers. Intel, too, has used its experience in optimizing its computers chips for Microsoft Windows software to work closely with Google on making Android run well on its devices. “We are not just investing in chips, we’re investing heavily in the software to run around them,” said Bell. This would doom it to playing a high-volume, low-margin game against low-cost chip makers in Taiwan like Mediatek. Intel counters that it is targeting the $200-$500 segment because that’s where a lot of the growth is, and that it intends to eventually offer chips that, like its PC chips, range across all price points. Intel executives also say they Will be offering a chip either later this year or early in 2014 that works on the 4G LTE networks already deployed in the United States and currently being rolled out in Europe. The problem there, says Gabriel of Rethink Wireless, is that it will then be lagging the likes of Qualcomm and STElectronics. Another concern is whether Intel can move beyond its usual partners. Persuading the likes of Acer and Lenovo to push out a smartphone is one thing, analysts say, but what about established phone makers like HTC Corp, let alone dominant players Samsung and Apple? Only then would Intel be able to get the volumes necessary for decent margins. In the long run, analysts said, a company with the resources of Intel had a reasonable chance of building at least some business in mobile. “Given Intel’s vast resources, I am not one to easily discount their ability to get into any market that they target,” said Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst at the IHS research firm. And as Intel’s Bell points out, the rapid fall of players like BlackBerry and Nokia, and the equally rapid rise of Samsung and Apple, suggest that just because Intel is a bit player now, it may not always be. “I was at a different firm building phones a couple of years ago and the company that was going to dominate Earth was RIM,” said Bell, who has worked at both Palm and Apple. He was referring to the Blackberry maker that has seen market share slip heavily in the past few years. “We’ll see two years from now who’s the market leader.” "
2012-09-11,2,"At the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, the company demonstrated sleek “ultrabook” laptops with improved gesture- and voice-recognition technology, similar to features already found on some smartphones. Intel’s upcoming processor, code-named Haswell and due to appear in a crop of laptops during next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to the company. “It was designed with mobility in mind ... from sleek tablets to ultrabooks to high-performing desktops,” said David Perlmutter, general manager of Intel’s Architecture Group. For Intel, showing off its most recent innovations at the forum this week is key to convincing investors and hardware developers that the PC industry remains innovative and still has a future. Perlmutter pointed to tablets with extendable screens and laptops with removable keyboards as devices that he said might catch on with the upcoming release of Microsoft Corp’s  Windows 8, which will feature touch capability. The top chipmaker cut its third-quarter revenue estimate more than expected on Friday due to a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer PCs. Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. It now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , which design their chips with power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Shares of Intel were up 1.4 percent at $23.58 in afternoon trading."
2014-04-30,-2,"An Intel statement did not specify any sum but Israeli media reported the company would invest $6 billion in the Kiryat Gat company, potentially creating thousands of jobs. A spokesman reached by Reuters declined to comment on the figure. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Intel’s plan had been under discussion for several years and welcomed the decision. Praising Israel as a centre of world technology, Netanyahu urged other global companies to expand investment in the country as well. Intel had said in January it would decide on the location of a planned new multi-billion dollar semiconductor plant using new 10 nanometre technology. It said on Wednesday it planned to “upgrade the Kiryat Gat facility to meet future needs,” but that “details of the project, including schedules, costs and technologies are not being disclosed at this time.” Intel Israel’s exports amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centres and received $1.5 billion in grants. Intel Israel employs nearly 10,000 people. It received grants totalling 28 percent of its investment when it built the Kiryat Gat plant, called Fab 28, which started operating in Israel in 1999.

2012-03-12,-1,"An Intel spokeswoman declined to comment on the story. The product could use an Intel set-top box and Intel’s name, and the chipmaker has told its potential partners it wants to start the service before the end of the year, the WSJ said. In October, Intel wound down its efforts to make chips for digital “smart” TVs, although it continues to make chips for set-top boxes. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group, headed by former BBC executive Erik Huggers, aimed at promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. "
2014-03-26,6,"It also reflects strategy at Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, to look for growth opportunities in new markets and reduce the company’s reliance on the slowing personal computer industry. Both companies are contributing packaging and semiconductor expertise that will help Altera improve the performance of chips for communications, high-performance computing and military applications. “We’re partnering to bring those technologies together in a single-package solution,” Howe said. Multi-die packaging is aimed at efficiently connecting separately made components as one device. Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components. Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller-form devices that use less energy and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips. Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel’s factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc. Intel’s manufacturing agreement with Altera is going “exceptionally well,” Sunit Rikhi, general manager of Intel’s contract manufacturing business, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our close collaboration enables us to work together in many areas related to semiconductor manufacturing and packaging.” The deal to share Intel’s prized manufacturing technology with Altera is the most notable of its kind so far for Intel. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in November he wanted more customers. Far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel views adding more manufacturing customers as one way to keep its multibillion-dollar factories operating at optimal levels. In February, Intel said that a new facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project to produce its most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Shares of Intel were down 0.3 percent at $25.39 while Altera’s stock was 1.2 percent lower at $35.98 on Wednesday afternoon. "
2016-04-15,-1,"Intel is also looking to consolidate some operations and close some smaller outposts after a series of acquisitions Oregonlive said on Friday. The job cuts, which could also include top executive roles, could begin soon after the company reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, Oregonlive said. Intel, which had 107,300 employees as of Dec. 26, declined to comment. The company had said in 2014 it planned to reduce its global workforce by about 5 percent, or more than 5,000 positions, as it struggled with falling personal-computer sales and shifted focus to faster-growing areas. Last week Intel said two senior executives would leave. "
2013-10-30,-4,"While discussions are in the advanced stages, it was still unclear if Verizon plans to take full control of Intel’s media unit or if Intel would maintain a stake in the unit, the report said. Representatives from Intel and Verizon both declined to comment. Earlier this year, Intel decided to launch an Internet TV service with live and on-demand content in a bid to find an alternative revenue stream as its core business of providing chips to computer makers erodes. It hired hundreds of workers and opened offices in Los Angeles and New York to work on the project. The field of players competing for in-home entertainment audiences is increasingly crowded. Apple Inc, Google Inc, Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp are jockeying for position to own the living room through TV, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s streaming video services have millions of subscribers. Verizon already has a streaming product as part of a joint venture with Redbox, which focuses mostly on streaming movies and not on TV shows, according to its website. That product competes with Netflix. Intel has struggled to reach content deals with media companies even though it offered to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, which is far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing.

2012-04-17,2,"“It’s not that they disappointed, they just didn’t give us the bull case. In previous quarters they blew the numbers out of the water,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. The long-time technology bellwether is ramping up production of its newest PC processor, codenamed Ivy Bridge, which is expected to drive sales later this year and power a new crop of super-thin laptops dubbed “ultrabooks.” But the costs of upgrading the factories where the chips are being made is temporarily hurting margins, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told a conference call. That was bad news to Wall Street, which has pushed shares of Intel 17 percent higher so far this year. “They had strong execution for the most part, and in-line expectations for the PC market. But from a investor standpoint you have a multi-year high stock price, very much priced for perfection. That gross margin guidance, while understandable, was not perfection,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter would be 62 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, down from 64 percent in the first quarter. Intel’s full-year gross margin forecast of 64 percent was unchanged. Demand in China and other emerging economies has helped sustain growth, and CFO Smith said business would pick up more as the industry recovers further from the hard-drive shortage and PC manufacturers replenish low component inventories. “As we ramp Ivy Bridge and people gear up for these really capable ultrabook sales in the last half of the year, you’ll start to see them refilling their pipelines with new products in the back half of this year,” Smith told Reuters. Intel is heavily promoting ultrabooks, which it hopes can stand up to the likes of Apple Inc’s Macbook Air, with some of the technological chic the iPad and other tablets epitomize. Some investors are concerned that expensive components used in them, like solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Wang and other analysts speculate Intel may have to sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to help make ultrabooks affordable. Intel says manufacturers are finding ways to bring down costs of ultrabooks, and CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on the call he was confident of the chipmaker’s previous prediction the new light-weight PCs would account for 40 percent of all notebook sales by the end of the year. “I‘m still very confident we can do that. All the signs are tracking there. Everything we’ve looked at since we first gave that number has gotten more positive, more designs, better price points,” Otellini said. With worldwide PC sales barely growing, Intel has been racing to find a foothold in smartphones and tablets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power-efficient chip designs are widely used. It has recently shown some encouraging signs with announcements that its newest processors would be used in a handful of upcoming smartphones. Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring the chipmaker a serious player in the mobile market. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete in mobile have fueled some of the gain in its shares in recent months. Microsoft’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 expected later this year is also likely to cause a jump in PC sales, but the operating system will be Microsoft’s first version of Windows that is compatible with chips designed by rival ARM. Intel could face new competition in low-end PCs from companies like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $13.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The world’s leading chipmaker said revenue in the first quarter was $12.9 billion, up from $12.85 billion in the year-ago period and a bit higher than the $12.85 billion expected. GAAP net income in the first quarter was $2.74 billion, down from $3.16 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 53 cents, better than the 50 cents expected. Shares of Intel fell 2.81 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.23 percent at $28.47 on Nasdaq. "
2012-12-06,2,"Otellini’s comments at a Sanford Bernstein investor conference on Wednesday stoked speculation the top chipmaker may manufacture mobile chips for Apple and pushed Intel’s shares higher on Thursday morning. “For the right types of products and not to enable my competitors, I would certainly consider it. There’s a lot of stuff in the pipeline,” Otellini said, according to a Thomson One transcript. ”As you know it takes a while to move your designs over, to design them under our process, for us to be able to bring them in-house and so forth and our foundry customers aren’t going to announce that they’ve moved until they’ve moved because it would hurt them at their current suppliers, Otellini said. RBC analyst Doug Freedman said Otellini’s comments about the possibility of open Intel’s plants to customers were more direct than previous ones. Apple currently depends on Samsung Electronics  to manufacture its mobile chips but the two companies are in a war over patents and also compete in smarpthones and tablets. Apple is believed to be looking for alternative suppliers. Intel raised eyebrows on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley in November when it said it will consider an outsider to take over after Otellini unexpectedly announced he will retire in May, potentially ending a four-decade tradition of internal succession. Some analysts took that as a sign that Intel, which has struggled to jump from the personal computer market to mobile, might be considering a transformative hire. But Otellini he expects the board to choose from among the chipmaker’s own executives. “It’s not up to me but I think that’s the most likely outcome. I‘m very comfortable with the internal candidates and the track record of internal versus external in our industry shows pretty clearly you want to stay inside if you can,” Otellini said. While the idea of an iconic visionary stepping in to lift Intel into the mobile market - its Achilles heel - may sound attractive, it could open the chipmaker to new risks should it waver from its traditional focus on hard-core manufacturing. “Even if you brought in Mr. or Ms. Perfect, that person is going to take whatever it is, two years to figure out the culture and the people and how systems work and stuff like that,” Otellini said. “In this environment, why take the risk and take the time? So I think they will stay inside.” Shares of Intel rose 1.66 percent to $20.17."
2017-01-06,-27,"“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the report said. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” Russian authorities, which have previously denied interfering in the U.S. elections, offered no immediate comment on the report on Saturday, and the reaction of the country’s media was low-key.  The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump’s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report’s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed “the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election” nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. In Moscow, state TV Channel One briefly covered the report, focusing on Trump’s comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election. The broadcaster, which led its news program on Orthodox Christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the Russian capital, also said the arguments used in the U.S. report had been widely mocked by Internet users. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC’s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,” it said. “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. “Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” it said. ‘TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORY’ In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC. “There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence “relayed” the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump’s comments. “The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said. “It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying - which is true - it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to ... Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,” he said. “The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile “facts surrounding Russia’s active measures,” adding: “This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.” "
2013-10-23,3,"Perlmutter, who was passed over by Intel’s board for the job of chief executive officer earlier this year, will leave in February to pursue other opportunities, the company said in a filing on Wednesday. As Executive Vice President and General Manager, Intel Architecture Group, Perlmutter was sidelined in May after Brian Krzanich was appointed chief executive and quickly reorganized the chipmaker’s main product groups. The PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Perlmutter now answer directly to Krzanich, who previously ran Intel’s cutting-edge chip plants. Known affectionately within Intel and among friends as Dadi, Perlmutter joined the company in 1980 after graduating from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. A decade ago, he headed development of technology used in Intel’s Centrino platform, which led to the widespread adoption of Wifi technology that freed computer users from using cables to connect to the Internet. Before that, he led technology pushes that contributed to Intel’s Pentium processors. “A lot of the way people use their PCs today is due in no small part to the work Dadi did,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. During his career, Intel became a dominant chipmaker calling the shots in the PC industry. But in recent years, it has struggled to catch up with smaller rivals such as Qualcomm Inc as smartphones and tablets gained popularity. An Israeli based at the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California headquarters, Perlmutter was also the company’s most senior Intel executive to be paid in Israeli shekels. "
2014-09-25,2,"It was unclear how much Intel is paying or what portion of the companies the U.S. chipmaker is buying. The acquisition could be made through Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the sources said. Tsinghua Unigroup owns Spreadtrum and RDA. Struggling to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market, Intel has recently sought to partner with mobile chipmakers in the hope they could help it regain the market dominance it enjoyed when personal computers reigned.

2012-01-11,2,"The agreements with the U.S. and Chinese consumer electronics makers help shore up Intel’s boldest foray into the mobile arena. The company is hoping its new “Medfield” chip conserves enough power to compete with rival smartphones using ARM Holdings’ more energy-efficient architecture. The world’s largest chip maker is also making a concerted push for the likes of Hewlett Packard to go big on super-slim, Apple Macbook Air-like laptops called Ultrabooks, which it hopes will preserve its dominance of the PC market as tablets like the iPad draw consumers away. “It is a multi-year, multi-product strategy that will bring both phones and tablets to the (U.S.) marketplace starting with a phone in the second half of 2012,” Dave Whalen, a vice president in the Intel Architecture Group, said of the agreement with Motorola. “You’re going to see us working very closely with them on technologies,” Whalen told Reuters in an interview. With mobile processors made by the likes of Texas Instruments Inc and Samsung stealing the show, Intel’s engineers have been laboring to adapt technology refined over decades for PCs to work better in handheld devices without quickly draining their batteries. With its chips so far seen as to power hungry for handheld devices, Intel has found itself left behind in a headlong race to design the brains of tablets and smartphones. An ongoing relationship to build smartphones with Motorola could position Intel well in the fast-growing market, even if Motorola continues to make phones using other companies’ processors. Motorola Mobility has agreed to be bought by Google, which owns the Android platform widely used on smartphones and tablets competing with Apple. “We’re going to work very closely with Motorola and Google and really figure out what kind of things we can do that are unique and different,” Whalen said, mentioning camera and video technology as examples. The Lenovo agreement builds on an existing partnership between the two companies focused on personal computers. Lenovo, the world’s No. 2 PC maker, has focused its strategy on its home market but on Tuesday, it said it would sell a smartphone for U.S. consumers in time. Many on Wall Street deem Intel at a crossroads, where it either has to carve out a share of the mobile market or risk becoming irrelevant in the long run. The Santa Clara, California company has made previous attempts at processors for smartphones and tablets that fell short of expectations and were passed over by manufacturers. Many Wall Street investors have since taken a “wait and see” attitude toward Intel’s efforts in mobile. With the tablet and smartphone market booming -- partly at the expense of personal computers -- investors worry that the chipmaker’s setback in mobile could leave it badly positioned for future waves of mobile devices. Worldwide smartphone processor sales came to $2.24 billion in the third quarter of last year, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. That’s a pittance compared with Intel’s $14.7 billion in revenue in the same quarter. But smartphone sales are expected to grow 32 percent in 2012, according to IHS iSuppli, while some experts see marginal PC microprocessor demand growth at best. "
2014-12-09,2,"Intel’s platform is like a set of building blocks based on the chipmaker’s components and software for companies to create smart, connected devices, Doug Davis, head of Intel’s Internet of Things business, said at a launch event in San Francisco. It also aims to make it easier to connect to data centers in order analyze data collected from devices’ sensors. “We’re creating compute capability in end-point devices that scale from our highest performance Xeon processor to the Quark family of products,” Davis said, referring to Intel’s chips. After moving slowly in recent years to adapt its personal computer chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel is determined to make sure it is on the leading edge of future computing trends, industry experts and company executives have said. Adding processors, sensors and web connectivity to devices from soccer balls to industrial machinery, an emerging trend dubbed the Internet of Things, has become a new battleground for Intel, rival Qualcomm and other technology companies. The install base of wireless gadgets will more than double by the end of the decade, with most of the growth coming from smart devices other than PCs and smartphones, according to market research firm ABI Research. Intel’s Internet of Things Group had $530 million in revenue in the September quarter. That accounted for just 4 percent of Intel’s total revenue in the quarter, but it grew 14 percent over the previous year, which was faster than the company’s PC business. Dell, SAP, Tata Consultancy, Accenture  and other companies are working with the new reference model, Davis said.    (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Alan Crosby)"
2013-11-05,-1,"As Intel strives to make sure it’s not caught off-guard by future technology trends, its new ‘Internet of Things Solutions Group’ will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, according to Doug Davis, the group’s general manager. “Krzanich is saying, ‘I want a higher level of focus on this to help us grow it and put the level of attention on it that it deserves,'” Davis told Reuters on Tuesday. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the personal computer industry but was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. A three-decade Intel manufacturing veteran who took over as CEO in May, Krzanich has made developing mobile chips a higher priority within Intel. In September, Krzanich announced that Intel was working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, along with an ingestible version for biomedical uses. The new solutions group combines an existing Intel business focused on chips for commercial and industrial devices with Intel’s Wind River subsidiary, which sells software for commercial and industrial devices. “We’re pulling together a couple of pieces that are already doing well and we want to accelerate those efforts. This creates a primary focus around ‘Internet of Things,'” Davis said. "
2014-11-20,-3,"Kicking off Intel’s annual investor day, Bryant said he saw progress in Intel’s strategy of staking out a big chunk of market share in tablets this year by offering manufacturers subsidies to use its chips. “I‘m not going to tell you I‘m proud of losing the kind of money we’re losing but I‘m also going to tell you I‘m not embarrassed by it like I was a year ago about where we were,” Bryant said. “This is the price you pay for sitting on the sidelines for a number of years and then fighting your way back into the market.” Intel was late to mobile and under CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over last year, it has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones and compete better against Qualcomm, MediaTek and others. Krzanich said a plan disclosed this week to merge Intel’s mobile unit with its PC group was in line with manufacturing customers that see their own product lineups of smartphones, tablets and laptops merging. He said Intel was on track to exceed its goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year. That strategy made Intel the No 2 tablet chip supplier in the June quarter, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, but it cost the company billions of dollars in subsidies. Intel has made much less progress in chips for smartphones.    (Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Andrew Hay)"
2013-11-21,1,"With Intel far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, many on Wall Street have called for the company to expand its contract manufacturing business, which currently has a negligible impact on overall revenue, and to open its factories to high-volume clients making mobile chips. “We’re going go much further. If we can utilize our silicon to provide the best computing, we’ll do that,” Krzanich told analysts. At his first annual investor day since taking over as chief executive in May, Krzanich said the slumping personal computer industry, Intel’s core market, is showing signs of bottoming out. “Our view is that it’s declining but it’s beginning to show signs of stabilization,” he said."
2012-09-13,4,"Aiming to do away with the need to remember passwords for growing numbers of online services, Intel researchers have put together a tablet with new software and a biometric sensor that recognizes the unique patterns of veins on a person’s palm. “The problem with passwords -- we use too many of them, their rules are complex, and they differ for different websites,” Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs, said at the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Thursday. “There is a way out of it, and biometrics is an option.” Iyengar demonstrated the technology, quickly waving his hand in front of a tablet but not touching it. Once the tablet recognizes a user, it can securely communicate that person’s identity to banks, social networks and other services where the person has accounts, he said. Making laptops, tablets and smartphones responsible for identifying users would take that requirement away from individual websites and do away with the need to individually enter passwords into each of them, Iyengar said. “We plan to work with service providers to take full advantage of this,” he said. A device using the technology would use built-in accelerometers to detect when a user puts it down, and would then log its owner off to keep unauthorized people from getting in. The palm-identification technology was one of several demonstrations during a keynote address by Intel Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner at the forum. Rattner runs Intel Labs, which focuses on identifying and solving future technology problems. Rattner also showed prototype technology to improve cell-phone base stations and to efficiently and wirelessly connect devices such as printers, tablets and monitors throughout the home. He debuted a prototype microchip with wifi technology made with digital circuitry instead of analog, a development that has the potential to lead to major improvements in performance and efficiency. The palm-reading technology, still under development, requires new software and biometric sensors built into consumer devices, but does not require the development of any new kinds of chips, Rattner said. The technology works much better than the finger-print scanners found on some laptops today, he said."
2012-04-25,-9,"The European Commission, which acts as EU competition regulator, penalised Intel with its largest ever corporate fine because of anticompetitive tactics against arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The decision came after an eight-year-long investigation. Intel will argue its case in a four-day hearing at the Luxembourg-based General Court on July 3 to 6, said two people familiar with the case. The company has said the fine, which represented 4.15 percent of its 2008 turnover, was “manifestly disproportionate”. EU regulators can penalise companies with fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenue. Intel has already gained backing from the European Ombudsman, who censured the Commission for procedural errors in its investigation. In his non-binding report issued five months after the regulatory finding, the Ombudsman said he had found “maladministration” because the regulator had failed to make a proper note of a meeting with computer maker Dell Inc  during its probe.

2014-06-18,-1,"The Santa Clara, California company is integrating its Xeon processors with programmable chips that will give customers with unique technical requirements more flexibility to optimize their servers. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel. Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook. It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want. Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings. The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,” Bryant said. Intel already sells server products that combine Xeon chips and programmable chips but on the new component they will be much more closely integrated, resulting in up to double the performance, Bryant said. She declined to say when Intel would sell the new product, how much they would cost or what company would supply the programmable chip, a technology distinct from Intel’s focus on processors. Programmable chips are typically used by manufacturers making small quantities of products or prototypes that do not warrant the expense of designing a new chip from the ground up. On Wall Street they are used to run complex financial simulations. Microsoft has already been experimenting with using programmable chips to help power its Bing web search engine. Intel announced in March it was expanding its existing contract manufacturing relationship with programmable chipmaker Altera to develop future components that combine different kinds of chips. Bryant said that arrangement was unrelated to the upcoming Xeon offering.    (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Diane Craft)"
2015-03-27,-1,"Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, the world’s biggest chipmaker has been slower than its rivals to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. Earlier this month, Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast to $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers. Shares of Altera shot up about 28 percent after the talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, closing at $44.39 per share on the Nasdaq. Intel shares also gained on the news, rising 6.4 percent to $32. Shares of Xilinx, Altera’s main rival, closed up 6 percent. “On the surface, Altera is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margins than Intel, and with about two-thirds of its revenue from telecom, wireless, military/aerospace, it definitely fits the bill of diversifying revenue beyond Intel’s legacy computer markets,” said Cowen & Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, in a note to clients.      Intel declined to comment on the report. An Altera spokesman also declined to comment.    Any deal for Altera, valued at $10.4 billion at Thursday’s close and more than $13 billion after trading ended on Friday, would easily surpass Intel’s previous biggest deal, its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. Altera’s value to Intel is its programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers, where they are customized for specialized functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks.  Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has already been manufacturing chips on behalf of the smaller company since 2013, a major change for Intel, which traditionally has been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology.  Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry. Features such as WiFi or Bluetooth that once required chips sold by separate companies can now be squeezed onto single pieces of silicon. Deals in the chip sector have been expected after NXP Semiconductors’ (NXPI.O) $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor FSL.N was announced earlier this month. Worldwide semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data show. In the 12 months through March 2, 472 chip M&A deals were made worldwide, up from 383 in the previous year. Unlike typical semiconductors, programmable chips made by Altera can be customized after they are manufactured to suit different purposes.  "
2016-11-29,0,"Companies from Alphabet Inc’s Google to Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Tesla Motors Inc are vying to put autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, which could radically reshape transportation across the country.  Intel will provide a “system on chip” for autonomous vehicle systems that Delphi and Mobileye are developing together, Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, told Reuters.  UK-based Delphi is talking with established automakers and new or niche vehicle companies, such as manufacturers of commercial vehicles, interested in automating vehicles, De Vos said.  The system Delphi and Mobileye are developing would likely come to market first in a commercial vehicle operating in a limited area, such as an airport shuttle or a ride-hailing service, DeVos said. Delphi is testing autonomous driving technology in vehicles in Singapore. By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city. “We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,” De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said. Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said. "
2012-07-10,6,"ASML shares rose 10 percent on the news. Intel fell about 1 percent after hours. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon, but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. “We’re talking about $50 tablets” said Richard Windsor, Nomura’s global technology specialist. “This brings into the realms of possibility a technology that we thought wasn’t feasible and opens up the possibility for greater cost reductions”. Intel said on Monday it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent of ASML and fund its research. TSMC said it was considering a similar deal. Intel hopes to speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require huge capital investment, but would deliver billions of savings by cutting chip production costs. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Under the terms of the deal, Intel will invest $1 billion in research into those two technologies, which are expected to emerge in the next few years. It will also acquire an initial 10 percent stake in ASML and tack on another 5 percent if it wins shareholder approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. Shares in rival Nikon, which also researches and develops lithography processes, fell 7 percent on the news. A spokesman said Nikon “would like to continue our cooperation with Intel going forward”. “In a bold move to bring heavy investment into its future development needs, tie in large customers and damage any Nikon ambitions in EUV, ASML has delivered a strong message of strategic intent for the next semi cycle and beyond,” Jeffries International research said in a note. Intel and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand as consumers shift to mobile devices, and economic growth in Europe and even emerging markets is weakening. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned its second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent, blaming disappointing demand from China and Europe. RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman said Intel could save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Intel Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” Intel, the world’s top chipmaker, gains no exclusive rights to ASML products in the deal. But Freedman said Intel stood to gain if the overall industry benefited and by lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets would open new markets. Intel remains at the vanguard of computer processors but is seeing rivals like Samsung Electronics come on strong in application of microchips for smartphones and other mobile devices. Analysts say the U.S. company maintains a two-year lead over the competition but needs to spend heavily to safeguard that. A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months. While many semiconductor companies outsource the fabrication of actual chips to third-party “foundries”, Intel is among the last remaining chipmakers that build and operate their own network of multibillion dollar production facilities, or “fabs”.

The world’s biggest chipmaker dominates the PC industry but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets."
2013-02-25,-1,"Intel will make Altera’s programmable chips using its upcoming 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology, the most notable agreement of its kind announced so far by the chipmaker. “It’s a step in terms of building into a business level we wish to achieve,” Sunit Rikhi, Vice President and General Manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters on Monday. “There’s no doubt in my mind the foundry will be a significant player in the future.” Building new generations of chip manufacturing plants is becoming more and more expensive, and Intel has said in the past it was willing to open its facilities to carefully selected customers - as long as doing so does not its help competitors. Intel has announced agreements to manufacture on behalf of Achronix Semiconductor Corp and other small chipmakers but Monday’s announcement with Altera, one of two leading programmable chipmakers, is potentially much larger. “They’ve crossed over the line from it just being a questionable experiment to - we’re going to do this for tier-1 customers,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. With Intel struggling to find its footing in smarpthones and tablets with its own processor designs, some investors believe Intel may eventually agree to make Apple’s processors for the iPhone and iPad. “If and when we are called upon to serve large mobile customers who can drive a lot more volume, we could serve them today in terms of capability,” Rikhi said. “I‘m confident we have a very strong platform of offering upon which we can scale.” He declined to discuss Apple specifically. Intel has kept its own fabs and invested heavily in them over decades, resulting in a lead in manufacturing know-how that allows it to make chips that in some respects are more advanced than products from rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Altera Chief Executive John Daane told Reuters in a phone interview that Altera, which depends on communications infrastructure for about half of its business, is the only major programmable chipmaker that will have access to Intel’s plants. “We are essentially getting access like an extra division of Intel. As soon as they’re making the technology available to their various groups to do design work, we’re getting the same,” he said. Daane said Intel’s manufacturing technology will give Altera’s chips a several-year advantage against Xilinx, its main competitor in programmable chips. He said Altera would continue to make other chips with TSMC, its long-time foundry. Shares of Altera were unchanged in extended trading after closing down 0.96 percent at $35.01. Xilinx was down about 0.9 percent at $37, versus a close of $37.30 on the Nasdaq. Intel’s stock was up 0.49 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.93 percent at $20.23. "
2014-03-26,3,"The new venture, to produce what are known in the technology world as ‘multi-die’ devices, builds on an agreement announced over a year ago for Intel to open its cutting-edge factories to produce Altera’s programmable chips, Brad Howe, Altera’s senior vice president of research and development, told Reuters late on Tuesday. It also reflects strategy at Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, to look for growth opportunities in mobile devices, reducing the company’s reliance on the slowing personal computer industry. Both companies are contributing packaging and semiconductor expertise that will help Altera improve the performance of chips for communications, high-performance computing and military applications. “We’re partnering to bring those technologies together in a single-package solution,” Howe said. Multi-die packaging is aimed at efficiently connecting separately made components as one device. Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components. Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller form devices that use less energy, and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips. Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel’s factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc. “Things are going exactly as we’d expect them to be going,” Altera’s Howe said. “We’re very committed jointly to a successful program.” The deal to share Intel’s prized manufacturing technology with Altera is the most notable of its kind so far for Intel. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said in November he wanted more customers. Far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, adding more manufacturing customers is one way for Intel to keep its multi-billion dollar factories operating at optimal levels. In February, Intel said that a new facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project to produce Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future. "
2014-12-04,-2,"As part of the upgrade, Intel said in a statement on Thursday it would bring its most advanced chip-testing technology to China. In exchange it will receive local and regional government support for construction. “Deploying our newest advanced testing technology in China shows our commitment to innovating jointly with China,” Intel executive vice president William Holt said in the statement. “The fully upgraded Chengdu plant will help the Chinese semiconductor industry and boost regional economic growth.” The announcement comes three months after Intel purchased a minority stake in a government-controlled semiconductor company to jointly design and distribute mobile chips, an industry that China considers to be of strategic importance. Intel’s fortunes in China contrast with the travails of its rival, Qualcomm Inc, which is expected to announce in the coming days a potentially record-breaking settlement with Chinese antitrust regulators. China’s investigation into San Diego-based Qualcomm, as well as a spate of recent probes against firms including Microsoft Corp, have prompted an outcry from foreign business lobbies. They say the Chinese government is increasingly adopting strong-arm tactics to yield technology-sharing or other arrangements beneficial to domestic industry. The government, meanwhile, has defended its regulatory scrutiny as even-handed. It has pointed to a history of Qualcomm and Microsoft facing similar antitrust probes in Western countries. Analysts say there is a broad recognition that foreign companies must do more to stay in China’s good graces. “Intel’s taking the approach that’s appreciated by the Chinese government,” Nomura analyst Leping Huang said. “These days if you want to make money in China, you have to invest in China.” "

2014-01-17,-6,"In the December quarter, Intel’s PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected. Microsoft Corp’s plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees’ PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter. Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry’s decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets. The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media. But Smith said Intel’s data center group revenues in 2014 would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. The 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected. “The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. “Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise.” Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. “We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter, and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,” he told analysts. But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. “The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,” Smith told Reuters. “What’s driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we’ve been working on.” At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices, including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers any time soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry. Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers. Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $13.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel slid 4.8 percent in extended-hours trading on Thursday after ending the regular session down 0.49 percent at $26.54 on the Nasdaq. One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome. “You’re getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “This management team is not running this company to deliver earnings.” (The story was officially corrects year-ago Q4 revenues to $13.5 bln from $12.5 bln, which was incorrectly stated on Intel’s website) "
2012-03-13,2,"“We will start to see more and more of our capacity and our output go to things that are mobile, like phones and tablets and other devices,” Krzanich told Reuters. Krzanich was already in charge of Intel’s manufacturing, including a $12.5 billion capital spending budget for 2012, as well as much of the company’s day-to-day operations. As COO, he is now also in charge of Intel’s IT and human resources departments. Intel has fallen far behind in processors for smartphones and tablets like Apple’s iPad, a market dominated by chips based on technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings and made by companies like Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. The Santa Clara, California, chipmaker’s new Medfield chip has been chosen for a few upcoming smartphones from Lenovo, Motorola Mobility and other manufacturers, accomplishments seen by Wall Street as a good start. Intel is betting its lead in manufacturing technology will help it win more ground from rivals, and it is speeding up the rate at which it uses its most advanced factories to make mobile chips. As head of manufacturing, Krzanich shortened the time it takes Intel to build a cutting-edge plant and launch it into production. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, said that in the past five years he has halved the time it takes to manufacture a component, and cut by a similar amount the time it takes from receiving an order to delivering it. “What have I brought to manufacturing? Speed and agility,” he said. “That’s exactly what the PC business and exactly what the phone business will need.” Chief Executive Otellini was COO until 2005. Vice Chairman Andy Bryant, named executive chairman last year, had been handling some of the COO duties before Krzanich was promoted. "

2012-06-01,1,"Models expected later this year will have large touch screens, “instant on” responsiveness and razor-thin dimensions - all expensive features that have left some on Wall Street wondering if they might be too expensive for average consumers. Engineers at Intel’s Dupont, Washington R&D center, including former Boeing Co employees, have come up with a design method to make plastic laptop cases as strong as more-expensive metal ones typically used in ultrabooks, said Ben Broili, head of the team. He said that may cut the cost of future ultrabooks by between $25 and $75 by letting manufactures use plastic cases instead of metal ones without sacrificing quality. Their work is an example of the steps Intel is taking to find ways to make future ultrabooks more affordable - without cutting the prices of its processors. At a meeting with analysts last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said upcoming ultrabooks would be available for as little as $699, but many are expected to be priced nearer to $1,000 or more. Borrowing from product design methods used in the aerospace industry, the engineers have found that hard drives, motherboards and other components that make up the guts of a PC can be laid out in ways that make the laptops structure much stronger. “We didn’t develop a new material. We are able to use an existing plastic with an existing manufacturing technology,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. “It just requires some more upfront thought initially about how you lay your system out and how you can bring these things together and tie them in.” Different components in the laptop can be leveraged to support its chassis, or even dissipate heat from the processor, he said. “There is no one size fits all,” Broili added. “We’re trying to enable the entire industry. You can make trades, move stuff around; and if you don’t want your hard drive here, then move it. You have a menu you can pick from and see what you win or lose from a cost and quality standpoint.” Typically priced above $200 each, Intel’s processors are the costliest component in laptops. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is selling its new Trinity chips for less in a bid to undercut Intel in thin laptops. To get an idea of the structural quality of any laptop, Broili recommends lifting it up by a front corner while it is open and watching how much it flexes. Intel has already held a seminar in Taiwan to demonstrate its new design technique to PC design engineers and it is promoting it with specific manufacturers. At the Computex technology show in Taipei, Taiwan, next week, PC manufactures are set to unveil dozens of ultrabooks using Intel’s newest Ivy Bridge processors. They will also demonstrate future models with touch screens, based on Microsoft Corps’s Windows 8 platform, which is expected out later this year. Broili said Intel engineers are working on other ways to improve ultrabooks, including tweaks to motherboards, touch screens and Wifi. Separately, Intel launched a $300 million fund last year to invest in small companies focused on technologies complementing ultrabooks, such as improved battery life. A few ultrabook models launched this year have been reviewed as nice but pricey, leaving some analysts skeptical the category will attract mainstream shoppers. Otellini has said Intel is on track to reach its goal that ultrabooks account for 40 percent of all consumer notebooks sold by the end of the year. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage. "
2012-06-08,-5,"Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business. According to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising. The set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said. Intel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. - is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs. While none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices. “If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. Intel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age. For its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners. “They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks. An Intel representative declined to comment for this story. Chip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted. BEYOND PCs While Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential. According to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches. Intel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. According to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component. The biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners. Intel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license. “Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. To change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney. In addition to Huggers and Ancier, sources said, two other names prominent in TV circles have emerged as consultants for Intel: entertainment lawyer Ken Ziffren and former MTV executive Nicole Browning. Browning, who previously negotiated on the other side of the table for MTV, has been handling some of the talks with partners, sources said. Ziffren built his reputation representing Hollywood talent - he was instrumental in negotiating the deal that returned the “Tonight Show” to Jay Leno. Lesser known is his firm’s work negotiating deals for DirecTV’s video-on-demand service and carriage agreements for pay-TV network Starz. But even that quartet of executives may not be enough to resolve an intractable problem, which is that content companies have little incentive to offer their channels to Intel at a discount and Intel is loathe to pay a premium. “They’d love a better deal but they won’t get one,” said Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin of Intel. “The industry has always worked on volume discounts.” Underscoring the difficulty insurgent tech companies face in securing content, Microsoft in January indefinitely postponed plans for its own online TV subscription service after deciding that licensing costs were too high, according to people familiar with those discussions. And therein lies that dilemma that Intel and other insurgent over-the-top providers must tackle before their big plans can be realized. "
2012-12-06,2,"“For the right types of products and not to enable my competitors, I would certainly consider it. There’s a lot of stuff in the pipeline,” Otellini said, according to a Thomson One transcript. ”As you know it takes a while to move your designs over, to design them under our process, for us to be able to bring them in-house and so forth and our foundry customers aren’t going to announce that they’ve moved until they’ve moved because it would hurt them at their current suppliers, Otellini said. RBC analyst Doug Freedman said Otellini’s comments about the possibility of open Intel’s plants to customers were more direct than previous ones. Apple currently depends on Samsung Electronics to manufacture its mobile chips but the two companies are in a war over patents and also compete in smarpthones and tablets. Apple is believed to be looking for alternative suppliers. Intel raised eyebrows on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley in November when it said it will consider an outsider to take over after Otellini unexpectedly announced he will retire in May, potentially ending a four-decade tradition of internal succession. Some analysts took that as a sign that Intel, which has struggled to jump from the personal computer market to mobile, might be considering a transformative hire. But Otellini he expects the board to choose from among the chipmaker’s own executives. “It’s not up to me but I think that’s the most likely outcome. I‘m very comfortable with the internal candidates and the track record of internal versus external in our industry shows pretty clearly you want to stay inside if you can,” Otellini said. While the idea of an iconic visionary stepping in to lift Intel into the mobile market - its Achilles heel - may sound attractive, it could open the chipmaker to new risks should it waver from its traditional focus on hard-core manufacturing. “Even if you brought in Mr. or Ms. Perfect, that person is going to take whatever it is, two years to figure out the culture and the people and how systems work and stuff like that,” Otellini said. “In this environment, why take the risk and take the time? So I think they will stay inside.” Shares of Intel rose 1.66 percent to $20.17. "

Demand from companies for PCs likely received a boost recently due to Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) winding down of support in April for its Windows XP operating system, analysts say.     “PCs have been getting less bad for a while,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But if it’s all business PCs then the question is going to be sustainability.” Intel’s revised revenue and gross margin forecasts for the June quarter could translate to earnings per share of 52 cents, RBC analyst Doug Freedman said in a note to clients.     For the second quarter, analysts on average had expected EPS of 47 cents and revenue of $13.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel is expected to report its second-quarter results on July 15. Shares of Intel jumped 4.97 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.11 percent at $27.96 on Nasdaq. "

2014-08-13,0,"On Wednesday, the chip maker said it is teaming up with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, established by the actor and Parkinson’s sufferer in 2000, to conduct a multi-phase research study of the neurodegenerative brain disease. An estimated five million people globally have been diagnosed with Parkinson‘s, the second-most-common neurudegenerative disease after Alzheimer‘s. The initial goal is to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor patients remotely and store that data in an open system that can be accessed by scientists. In the next phase of the study, which will likely kick off in the fall, the foundation will set aside funds to explore how patients are responding to medication. Participants will be monitored via an array of wearable devices. “As more of these devices hit the market, we can collect objective measurements and determine the efficacy of new therapeutics,” Sohini Chowdhury, a senior vice president for research partnerships at the foundation, told Reuters. Clinical trials have been far too “subjective” in the past, she said. For instance, a patient might inform her doctor that she felt a tremor for several minutes, when it actually lasted a matter of seconds. In the future, Chowdhury hopes patients and their doctors will have more precise measurements via wearable devices about the “frequency and severity” of symptoms. Chowdhury said the foundation will continue to raise funding to cover the costs of providing wearable devices to patients. By using such devices, the foundation and other research groups can tap into a broader pool of patients for clinical trials, Chowdhury said. Today, many people with Parkinson’s disease are unable to participate in clinical trials because they do not live near a research facility. But wearable devices offer a convenient way to track patients from their work or homes, allowing people in the most rural parts of the country to participate. As it expands beyond the PC arena, Intel hopes to capture a share of the growing market for big data analytics and wearable devices in the health sector. Ron Kasabian, general manager of Intel’s Big Data Solutions group, said the data center and “Internet of Things” business units are exploring the sector. “We’re exploring how to pull data out of devices in real-time,” he said. “We can mine data to improve research, and better understand the behaviors and progression of the disease.” While Intel boasts its own wearable technologies, Kasabian stressed that the Parkinson’s study is device agnostic, meaning patients can test a variety of wearable gadgets. In March, Intel completed its acquisition of Basis Science, a startup that is best known for its wrist-band that measures the wearer’s heart rate. Intel expects to extend similar programs to related areas of health care, as well as other industries, including manufacturing.   (Reporting by Christina Farr; Editing by Dan Grebler)"
2016-07-20,-1,"Hurt by weak demand from enterprises, revenue at the highly-profitable unit rose 5 percent to $4 billion, but lagged the previous quarter’s 9 percent increase and remained below Intel’s annual target of low double-digit growth. “As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate,” Intel’s finance chief Stacy Smith said on a call with analysts. Intel has been focusing on the unit and its operation that makes chips for Internet-connected devices, as it seeks to lower dependence on the slowing PC market that it once helped create.     Sales from the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker’s traditional PC business, which also includes chips for mobile phones and tablets, declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the second quarter ended July 2. In contrast, global PC shipments fell less than expected in the quarter, helped by strength in the United States, according to research firm IDC.    Intel reported a better-than-expected profit as its cost-cutting begin to pay off. In April it announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its global workforce, of which it said about half was already complete. Intel’s forecast for $14.9 billion in current-quarter revenue topped the average analyst expectation of $14.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell to $1.33 billion, or 27 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $2.71 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/29Utu1w) Profit for the quarter was hit by a one-time charge of $1.41 billion related to its cost-cutting drive. Excluding one-time items, Intel’s profit was 59 cents per share, beating market expectations for a profit of 53 cents. Net revenue rose 2.6 percent to $13.53 billion, narrowly missing the average analyst estimate of $13.54 billion. "
2012-03-06,2,"It is designed to support the servers and workstations that handle what Intel estimates will be 33 percent annual growth of data traffic through 2015. Intel has already shipped its new platform to a host of server manufacturers. It said several - including Hewlett-Packard Co, Dell Inc, IBM, Oracle Corp and Cisco Systems Inc - are expected to announce Xeon-based server platforms on Tuesday. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is also stepping up investments in enterprise processors. Last week, the perennial runner-up to Intel announced that it would buy micro-server player SeaMicro for $334 million, getting into an emergent, power-efficient server technology. AMD has lost ground to Intel in the server market in past years but hopes SeaMicro can help its expansion into low-power solutions in massive data centers. But Intel executives said their own Xeon E5 platform can improve energy efficiency by more than 50 percent in some cases versus the previous generation. “We did look at SeaMicro’s fabric technology. There are probably very few people they didn’t come to and shop their solution to,” Bryant said. “We were not impressed. We declined and very soon after our competitor acquired them.” While Intel lags Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics in selling processors for smartphones and tablets, Intel executives have pointed to their server business as key to capitalizing on fast growth in the mobile market. The popularity of smartphones and other mobile gadgets has increased the need for massive computer centers that store data and feed email, videos and other information to those devices. UBS expects spending on data centers to surge 49 percent this year, driven by the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google. At Tuesday’s event, Intel trotted out a variety of clients to demonstrate how its new platform might be employed. German automaker BMW said it was using Xeon-based servers to keep its luxury cars linked to the Internet. “Soon we will have more than 10 million vehicles connected and that will lead us to 1 terabyte of data volume per day,” said Mario Muller, BMW vice president of IT infrastructure. "
2012-10-17,-9,"Intel’s corporate-focused server and data center business has helped offset weak PC sales in recent quarters, but in the third quarter, revenue from that division also disappointed as enterprises bought fewer servers. “You have to remember, data center has been the rock we’ve all leaned on,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “It’s a reflection of enterprises and companies rationalizing their year-end spend.” With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. Intel said the data center business, which sells server chips and other equipment to companies and governments, grew 6 percent year over year in the third quarter, although it was down 5 percent from the prior quarter. Profitability will also take a hit, as Intel idles excess capacity at its plants in an effort to reduce inventories of its processors. It foresees fourth-quarter gross margins of 57 percent, or 58 percent on a non-GAAP basis, both plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 62 percent for the current quarter. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said about two-thirds of the anticipated decline in margins will come from excess capacity charges. Intel is also running its factories at less than 50 percent of their capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used on more cutting-edge production lines still being built. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. “I absolutely expect growth in the PC segment, and I firmly believe that the level of innovation we’re seeing in Ultrabooks is going to be one of the catalysts,” Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I‘m not going to put a number out there -but I expect it to grow.” Shares of Intel fell to $22.35 in after hours trade, after closing up 2.85 percent at $22.35. But in the fast-growing and cut-throat mobile world, Intel is struggling - its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may come back down to earth. The PC industry has been banking on Microsoft’s launch of Windows 8 later in October to breathe new life into laptops and slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. But there has been little sign of a significant bump in PC manufacturing or shipments ahead of the launch, at least in the short-term, analysts say. Intel estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $13.74 billion for the current quarter. In the third quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.23 billion in revenue for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings were $2.97 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared with $3.47 billion, or 65 cents a share in the same quarter last year. "

2016-11-29,0,"Companies from Alphabet Inc’s Google to Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Tesla Motors Inc are vying to put autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, which could radically reshape transportation across the country.  Intel will provide a “system on chip” for autonomous vehicle systems that Delphi and Mobileye are developing together, Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, told Reuters.  UK-based Delphi is talking with established automakers and new or niche vehicle companies, such as manufacturers of commercial vehicles, interested in automating vehicles, De Vos said.  The system Delphi and Mobileye are developing would likely come to market first in a commercial vehicle operating in a limited area, such as an airport shuttle or a ride-hailing service, DeVos said. Delphi is testing autonomous driving technology in vehicles in Singapore. By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city. “We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,” De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said. Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said. "
2012-04-25,-8,"The decision came after an eight-year-long investigation. Intel will argue its case in a four-day hearing at the Luxembourg-based General Court on July 3 to 6, said two people familiar with the case. The company has said the fine, which represented 4.15 percent of its 2008 turnover, was “manifestly disproportionate”. EU regulators can penalize companies with fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenue. Intel has already gained backing from the European Ombudsman, who censured the Commission for procedural errors in its investigation. In his non-binding report issued five months after the regulatory finding, the Ombudsman said he had found “maladministration” because the regulator had failed to make a proper note of a meeting with computer maker Dell Inc during its probe. The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission. ($1 = 0.7574 euros) "
2014-12-04,-2,"“Deploying our newest advanced testing technology in China shows our commitment to innovating jointly with China,” Intel executive vice president William Holt said in the statement. “The fully upgraded Chengdu plant will help the Chinese semiconductor industry and boost regional economic growth.” The announcement comes three months after Intel purchased a minority stake in a government-controlled semiconductor company to jointly design and distribute mobile chips, an industry that China considers to be of strategic importance.  Intel’s fortunes in China contrast with the travails of its rival, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is expected to announce in the coming days a potentially record-breaking settlement with Chinese antitrust regulators.  China’s investigation into San Diego-based Qualcomm, as well as a spate of recent probes against firms including Microsoft Corp, have prompted an outcry from foreign business lobbies. They say the Chinese government is increasingly adopting strong-arm tactics to yield technology-sharing or other arrangements beneficial to domestic industry. The government, meanwhile, has defended its regulatory scrutiny as even-handed. It has pointed to a history of Qualcomm and Microsoft facing similar antitrust probes in Western countries. Analysts say there is a broad recognition that foreign companies must do more to stay in China’s good graces. “Intel’s taking the approach that’s appreciated by the Chinese government,” Nomura analyst Leping Huang said. “These days if you want to make money in China, you have to invest in China.” "
2014-09-25,6,"Intel, which has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market, recently has sought to partner with mobile chipmakers in the hope they can help it gain the market dominance it has enjoyed with personal computers. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Tsinghua Unigroup did not respond immediately to a request for comment. This week there have been several reports in China of a potential deal, including one on the sina.com.cn news portal quoting unnamed sources as saying Intel would get 20 percent of Tsinghua Unigroup for $1.5 billion. The Beijing government has said in published policy papers it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically. China is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer and smartphone market. Intel, under Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, has pursued an array of deals and strategies to ensure its chip technology gets  into more smartphones and tablets. The newest investment comes less than six months after Intel reached an agreement with Chinese chip maker Rockchip to make inexpensive tablet chips with Intel’s architecture and branding. Since taking over as Intel’s CEO last year, Krzanich has also opened the chipmaker’s prized, cutting-edge factories to paying customers. More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing.   “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.”  While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilization of demand for personal computers. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus to China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Spreadtrum is one of several chipmakers that specialize in “turnkey” smartphone platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. Intel’s shares were down 1.47 percent at $34.24 in late-afternoon, in tandem with U.S. stock markets. "
2012-02-02,4,"After investors eyeing tepid PC sales shunned Intel’s shares for much of 2011, the stock has rebounded since September and recently hit a four-year high as the company promotes a new category of premium notebooks and shows off a mobile processor that may finally put it in the mobile race. Smith told Reuters his conversations with investors have become easier in the past few months. “A year ago, the concerns were that the drivers of the market weren’t going to let Intel grow and that there was something inherent in our architecture that precluded us from being able to participate in fast growing parts of the market,” Smith said in an interview on Wednesday. “Fast forward a year and we’ve alleviated both of those concerns.” Intel’s processors are the brains in 80 percent of the world’s personal computers, but the company has had a hard time adapting its powerful “x86” architecture to make low-powered chips for mobile devices that depend on batteries. With PC sales flagging in the United States and Europe, nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhones and iPads, use energy-efficient processors based on a competing technology licensed to chip designers by Britain’s ARM Holdings and made by Intel rivals like Samsung and Qualcomm. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, Intel impressed technophiles with demonstrations of its new Medfield mobile chip and said Motorola Mobility and Lenovo have picked it for upcoming smartphones. On a conference call with analysts following Intel’s quarterly report in January, he reassured investors that the company’s record $12.5 billion capital spending planned for 2012 would not become permanent and would come down in the future. Intel’s new mobile chip is made using Intel’s 32 nanometer manufacturing technology, and new generations of the chip manufactured at even smaller sizes in 2012 and 2013 will be even more energy efficient, Intel says. “We’re cleanly in the game. We’re among the best today with the current generation and it will extend out over time,” Smith said. Intel refocused its push into mobile on Google’s popular Android platform last year after cellphone maker Nokia backed away from a platform it had been working on with Intel. Analysts see Lenovo and Motorola’s decision to build phones using Medfield as a good start for Intel, but many remain cautious and are waiting to see how many Intel-powered phones are bought by consumers. Smith said Intel would eventually look to sell its chips for phones running competing platforms. “When you look at the phone market, there’s the Apple camp, the Google camp, the Microsoft camp. We will work hard to win designs across all those segments of the market.” Weak economies in the United States and Europe, as well as a growing preference for tablets, have hurt PC sales, and Intel is increasingly dependent on emerging markets like China to fuel growth. Eager to make laptops more attractive to consumers captivated by Apple’s iPad, MacBook Air and other mobile gadgets, Intel is pushing PC makers to concentrate on a new “Ultrabook” category of super-thin PCs boasting features from tablets like touch screens and “instant on” responsiveness. Some analysts question whether the high-end features Intel says Ultrabooks should include might make them too expensive for many consumers. Smith said he expects Ultrabooks prices to decline quickly. “As we drive scale, costs will come down,” Smith said. “We fully expect we’ll exit 2012 right in the heart of mainstream notebook price points with these very sexy Ultrabooks, because we’ll be shipping tens of millions of them.” "
2014-07-15,4,"Investors have pushed shares of PC mainstays Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel to decade-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) launch of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom.   “PCs have stabilized,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters after Intel’s report. He said he expects shrinking demand from consumers in China and other developing countries to rebound, just as it recently has in the United States.  From the end of 2010, the year the iPad was launched, to the end of 2013, annual global PC shipments shrank a total of 12 percent, according to IDC. Intel now expects the market’s recovery to help it grow its full-year revenue about 5 percent, slightly higher than prior expectations. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that improved demand from companies replacing old PCs would last at least through the end of 2014. “My presumption would be that if they’re confident enough to boost it that they see this (PC market) upside maintaining,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “God help them if they’re wrong.”  Intel said in a statement it expects third-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts had expected $14 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Revenue from Intel’s PC group rose 6 percent in the quarter while its data center group, a big contributor to gross margins, had revenue jump 19 percent. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and tablets. For the second quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group’s revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million and had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Intel’s second-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In June, Intel revised increased its second-quarter revenue outlook to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, citing stronger-than-expected demand for PCs used by businesses. Intel posted second-quarter net income of $2.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared with $2.0 billion, or 39  cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.  Intel shares closed up 0.70 percent at $31.71 in regular trade on Nasdaq. "
2014-01-14,0,"Intel’s decision not to open the chip plant was first reported by the Arizona Republic on Tuesday. “The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies,” Mulloy told Reuters. Despite not opening the new factory, or fab, Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1,000 employees since construction started in 2011, Mulloy said. Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people. Obama, while campaigning for re-election in 2012, made a stop at the factory’s construction site, where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the United States. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it was caught off guard by smartphones and tablets, a computing revolution that has cut into demand for PCs, the company’s core business. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, the worst year since market research firm Gartner began tracking those products. “The newer fab has not been equipped with the capital equipment. It has heating and air conditioning but the actual tools, the expensive stuff, are not in there,” Mulloy said. Much of Intel’s strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Intel originally meant to install its most advanced manufacturing technology at the plant and make 14 nanometer microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin. Existing factories at the Chandler site using Intel’s previous generation of manufacturing, 22 nm, are being converted to also make chips at 14 nm and many of Intel’s new employees are working there, Mulloy said. “It boils down to better capital utilization,” Mulloy said. The Santa Clara, California-based company says it makes around two thirds of its microprocessors in the United States, with others produced in Ireland, Israel and China. It is currently expanding a plant in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 millimeters - about the size of a large pizza. The largest wafers currently used in the chip industry measure 300 mm across. Plans by Intel and big rivals like Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) to eventually expand to 450 mm will allow them to save manufacturing costs by squeezing more chips on each wafer. Intel, which on Thursday is due to report is fourth-quarter earnings, said in November it expects its revenue to be flat in 2014 compared to last year. "
2014-12-01,5,"The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said PasswordBox will become part of the Safe Identity organization within Intel Security Group that is focused on simplifying and strengthening security by delivering ideas that reduce the pain of having to memorize dozens of passwords.  Earlier this year, Intel rebranded security software maker McAfee Inc, which it acquired for about $7.7 billion in 2011, as Intel Security Group.  PasswordBox, founded in 2012, has already been downloaded 14 million times and this year it won best mobile app at CES, a huge annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas. The tech security company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Robichaud said his goal is to get to a billion users. “We’ve grown really fast in the last 18 months faster than Dropbox and Evernote when they started, and teaming with Intel is our way of getting faster to a billion users,” said Robichaud in a phone interview, referring to other currently popular app-based service providers. PasswordBox last year secured $6 million in a Series A venture funding round led by OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, one of Canada’s largest pension funds with over C$65 billion ($57.40 billion) in net assets. “I think the speed of the transaction in this case speaks to the size of the market opportunity,” said Damien Steel, who is a director at OMERS Ventures and on the PasswordBox board.  Steel noted that very few start-ups typically get bought out by a big industry player this early in their lifecycle. Intel’s acquisition of PasswordBox is effective immediately and all 48 employees of the start-up are now a part of the Intel Security Group.  PasswordBox is the latest venture of Canadian entrepreneur and former radio host Robichaud. Back in 2010 he sold his earlier venture, a radio streaming service called StreamTheWorld to Triton Digital Media. "

2015-04-13,-4,"In letters to Altera's management, shareholders have raised concerns about the company's ability to create value on its own that matches Intel's offer, Bloomberg reported. (bloom.bg/1ykDar1) Some other large investors also have also sent letters, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Reuters reported last week discussions on a takeover of Altera by Intel had ended as the companies were unable to agree on price. Intel’s offer was in the neighborhood of the low-$50 per share range, CNBC reported on April 9. Altera’s shares closed at $43.86 on Monday, valuing the company at $13.2 billion. The stock has surged nearly 27 percent since merger talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal in March. As of Dec. 31, Cadian was Altera’s 10th-largest shareholder, with a 2.77 percent stake, according to Reuters data. TIG owns about 1.5 percent of Altera’s outstanding shares, one of the people told Bloomberg. Altera declined to comment. Intel, Cadian Capital and TIG were not immediately available for comment. "

Intel said on Thursday that it expected first-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million - about 7 percent lower than its earlier forecast of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, Intel has been slower than rivals such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. When Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) wound down support for its Windows XP operating system last April, Intel had expected a bounce in demand from small- and medium-sized businesses. But this has not happened.  According to BlueFin Research Partners, 75 million-76 million PCs will be shipped worldwide in the first quarter, a decline of 8-9 percent from the preceding quarter. Intel, whose historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft once delivered breathtakingly high profit margins, has been trying to offset the impact of slower PC upgrades by making chips for devices such as “2-in-1s”, which function as both laptop and tablet. Intel said the mid-point of its gross margin range would remain at 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel’s shares were down 4.8 percent at $30.76 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Microsoft’s shares were down 2.4 percent at $41.

2015-03-03,2,"The 3D cameras installed on laptops recognize gestures, enabling users to control their computers with hand and head movements. The technology was developed by Intel’s Israeli subsidiary close to TowerJazz’s manufacturing plant in northern Israel. Avi Strum, general manager of TowerJazz’s CMOS image sensor business, said the technology has numerous potential uses, such as the ability for the likes of cooks or car mechanics to operate a computer with gestures rather than having to touch it with dirty hands. The camera can also capture images of an object and quickly create a model for use in 3D printing. “Intel sensing solutions will bring consumers new experiences and will change the way people capture and share 3D images,” Strum said. “That Intel chose us for mass production of such sensors is very positive.” While gesture control is most common in laptops or gaming systems, it is expected to become more widely used in mobile devices such as smartphones. Shares in TowerJazz were up 4 percent at 69.19 shekels  ($17) in early afternoon trade in Tel Aviv. "
2012-10-08,-2,"McAfee spokesman Ian Bain said he could not provide more details about the job cuts, which he disclosed in response to an inquiry from Reuters. Intel Corp acquired McAfee, the world’s second largest security software maker, in February 2011 in a $7.7 billion deal. The division had 7,072 employees as of June 30, according to Bain."
2016-07-20,-1,"Hurt by weak demand from enterprises, revenue at the highly-profitable unit rose 5 percent to $4 billion, but lagged the previous quarter’s 9 percent increase and remained below Intel’s annual target of low double-digit growth. “As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate,” Intel’s finance chief Stacy Smith said on a call with analysts. Intel has been focusing on the unit and its operation that makes chips for Internet-connected devices, as it seeks to lower dependence on the slowing PC market that it once helped create.     Sales from the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker’s traditional PC business, which also includes chips for mobile phones and tablets, declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the second quarter ended July 2. In contrast, global PC shipments fell less than expected in the quarter, helped by strength in the United States, according to research firm IDC.    Intel reported a better-than-expected profit as its cost-cutting begin to pay off. In April it announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its global workforce, of which it said about half was already complete. Intel’s forecast for $14.9 billion in current-quarter revenue topped the average analyst expectation of $14.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell to $1.33 billion, or 27 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $2.71 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/29Utu1w) Profit for the quarter was hit by a one-time charge of $1.41 billion related to its cost-cutting drive. Excluding one-time items, Intel’s profit was 59 cents per share, beating market expectations for a profit of 53 cents. Net revenue rose 2.6 percent to $13.53 billion, narrowly missing the average analyst estimate of $13.54 billion. "
2012-01-20,2,"On Thursday, Intel also said it would sharply increase capital spending in 2012, quickening efforts to catch up in the tablet and smartphone markets. “Promotions for Brian (Krzanich) and these other rotations reinforce Paul and the board’s commitment to senior management’s development and to support the board for when it will eventually make a decision on Paul’s successor,” Intel spokeswoman Laura Anderson told Reuters. Krzanich, 51, will continue to oversee worldwide manufacturing for the world’s top chipmaker, while handling internal operations as well. Otellini, who must retire in four years when he reaches 65, due to a company rule, was the last Intel exec to officially hold the COO position. Vice Chairman Andy Bryant, who Intel previously announced would become full-time chairman, had been handling many of the responsibilities of a COO. The company is also promoting or redeploying several other executives across its chip architecture, manufacturing, and data-center businesses. Dadi Perlmutter assumes the mantle of chief product officer, while continuing to helm the Architecture Group. Bill Holt, the company’s tech-development chief, now reports directly to Otellini. Kirk Skaugen becomes Intel’s new PC Client Group chief, reporting to Perlmutter. Skaugen headed Intel’s data center business, impressing his bosses and investors by growing the group’s revenue from $6.5 billion in 2009 to over $10 billion last year. Intel likely hopes that moving Skaugen over to the PC client group will inject more energy into that slower-growing business, which has been plagued by slow consumer demand and the growing popularity of Apple’s iPad. “He’s a hard charger, whip smart, very inspirational,” said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. “The guy just doesn’t miss a beat when it comes to articulating the goals and the technology merits of his product categories.” Diane Bryant succeeds Skaugen as general manager of the data-center business. And Kim Stevenson, head of IT Global Operations and Services, succeeds Bryant as chief information officer. All management changes will take effect over the next 30 days, Intel said in a statement. Shares in the company gained 1.6 percent to $26.04 in midday trade as Wall Street welcomed its solid quarterly results. Several brokers, including Citigroup and Barclays, raised their target prices on the stock. "
2014-05-28,1,"Intel describes Jimmy as a research robot, but the company intends to make 3D-printable plans available without charge for a slightly less advanced version, and partners will sell  components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits.  Jimmy can be programmed to sing, translate languages, send tweets and even serve a cold beer. Under Krzanich, who took over a year ago, the chipmaker is trying to be an early player in emerging technologies like smart clothing, after coming late to the mobile revolution and making little progress in smartphones and tablets.  Its strategy includes engaging tech-savvy do-it-yourselfers and weekend hobbyists working on everything from Internet-connected baby blankets to robots and drones. Owners of the robots will be able to program them to perform unique tasks. They can then share the programs with other owners as downloadable apps. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, hopes the price for the robot kits will fall below $1,000 within five years.

2013-12-12,-1,"The idea behind the unusual positioning of the “Intel Inside” logo is that it will be revealed when a player lifts his shirt to celebrate scoring a goal, Barca officials told a news conference in the Catalan capital. Manel Arroyo, a club director responsible for media and sponsorship, said players including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta would be under no obligation to display the logo, which will be added to the shirts for the first time in Saturday’s La Liga match at home to Villarreal. Arroyo declined to reveal how much the deal - which runs for four and a half years and includes an option for an extension - was worth, saying it was “confidential”. As part of their first foray into soccer sponsorship, Intel will also provide technology to players and coaching staff as well as the recruits at Barca’s academy. Deborah Conrad, Intel’s chief marketing officer, said the decision to partner with Barca had been taken after a search for suitable “passion points” that the company hoped to tap into to help connect them with consumers. Barca have one of the most active social media communities in sport as well as hundreds of millions of fans around the world, Conrad noted. “We did not want to put the players under any obligation to show the logo a specific number of times but we do know that such goal celebrations are a big part of the culture of the sport,” Conrad told Reuters by telephone. Barca’s main sponsors include sporting goods manufacturer Nike, carmaker Audi, and the airline Qatar Airways, whose logo will remain on the outside of the players’ shirts. "

2015-10-14,-5,"Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center unit to grow in “low double digits” on a percentage basis in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent, as businesses cut spending. Worldwide IT spending on data center systems is expected to fall 3.8 percent in $142 billion this year, research firm Gartner said in June, citing a strong dollar. “Perhaps the revelation of low double-digit was a little worse than people had expected, but this is a long-term phenomenon for them whereby this group has finally gained critical mass,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters. The data center group comprised about 29 percent of the company’s total revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Analysts expect the business to account for about 40 percent of the total by 2017. Rolland said investors should not over-react to what was just a trimming of the growth outlook for the business. Analysts said Intel’s data center business was strong enough to withstand the concerns of weakness in the broader economy. Deutsche Bank Markets Research analysts noted that while the data center group has slowed due to enterprise weakness, it is still growing at double-digits on a percentage basis. Some analysts, however, said the forecast cut could be indicative of weak growth going ahead into 2016. “Data center expectations were stepped down meaningfully exiting the year, and we believe the trajectory in 2016 carries meaningful risk,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note. Some expect growth to remain in the low double-digit range. “(DCG) is still a very good business, but we think growth will be more in the 10-12 percent range, leaving overall corporate revenue growth in the low single digits,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. Up to Tuesday’s close of $32.04, Intel’s stock had fallen 11.7 percent this year, compared with a 9.4 percent fall in the broader semiconductor index. "
2015-10-14,-6,"Expanding the business is critical to Intel’s efforts to reducing its dependence on the PC market, which has been shrinking for almost four years. Buying Altera Corp  earlier this year was a step in this direction.

2012-09-11,-5,"Intel’s upcoming processor, code-named Haswell and due to appear in a crop of laptops during next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to the company. The chip will allow devices to stay on longer without needing to recharge and underscores the Intel’s recognition that mobility will only become a bigger factor in personal computing. “It was designed with mobility in mind ... from sleek tablets to ultrabooks to high-performing desktops,” said David Perlmutter, general manager of Intel’s Architecture Group. In an interview with Reuters, Perlmutter steered away from strict categories of laptops and tablets and said manufacturers over the next few year will offer a wider range of mobile products for consumers, mixing and matching new features, performance and size. Recent launches of smaller tablet sizes by Google and Amazon are examples of the already growing range of devices consumers have to choose between, a trend that will gain more steam, he said. “There will be a variety of needs fulfilled by a variety of solutions. Some people want something very benign, very simple,” Perlmutter said. “Others need performance.” Perlmutter pointed to tablets with extendable screens and laptops with removable keyboards as devices that he said might catch on with the upcoming release of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8, which will feature touch capability. Intel’s tablet strategy so far has focused on Windows 8, but Perlmutter said tablets running Intel processors and widely-used Google’s Android platform are also in the works. The top chipmaker cut its third-quarter revenue estimate more than expected on Friday due to a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer PCs. Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. It now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips with power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. The combined market for PCs, smartphones and tablets is expected to almost double over the next four years, but Intel’s share of the processors used in them will dip from 35 percent to 29 percent, according to a report this week from IHS iSuppli. While macroeconomic troubles have weighed on sales for several quarters, the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones is seen as an existential threat to the PC industry. The Haswell chip’s improved power efficiency is a step in the right direction to offering consumers punchy performance in thin laptops without sacrificing battery life, said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Will it stymie the shift towards tablets and smartphones? Not yet, but only time will tell,” Wang said. As well as investors, Intel’s forum is visited by thousands of hardware developers, many of whom face decisions about whether to focus their resources on the PC industry or mobile devices using chips made by Intel’s rivals. Intel is heavily promoting premium Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors. But Wall Street investors say that adding costly touch screens to models due out soon may make them too expensive for many consumers. Many ultrabooks currently on the market, without touch screens, cost over $1,000. Perlmutter said bringing down the costs of building ultrabooks to make them more mainstream is a challenge Intel is working on with PC manufacturers. Underscoring the shift in focus toward mobile, Apple on Wednesday will become a distraction for participants at the forum when it is expected to launch its newest iPhone at a nearby venue. Some analysts said Perlmutter’s speech was light on details about future products than keynotes in previous years. “This time around, the company only highlighted a few next-gen features, lacking the details to show how Intel would play more materially in the low-power segment of computing devices,” Freedman said. Shares of Intel were up 1.4 percent at $23.58 in afternoon trading. "

Intel’s fifth chief executive, Otellini has worked at the company for nearly 40 years and became CEO in 2005. Intel’s board was surprised last week when Otellini announced he planned to retire and it tried to get Otellini to stay, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said. Some Wall Street analysts said it might make sense for Intel to consider hiring an outsider to shake up its strategy as the computing world goes through its most significant shift since the advent of the Internet. But internal candidates will have a leg up over potential outside contenders because of Intel’s size, complexity and engineer-driven culture, Mulloy said. “For any company of the size and complexity of Intel, an internal candidate would have a natural advantage,” he said. However, Mulloy added: “Good corporate governance dictates today you should look inside and out.” Intel, whose processors are dominant in personal computers, has been slow to expand into the fast-growing mobile industry, where Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones and other popular mobile devices use competing technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc. “We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now. It’s the era of Intel versus ARM, so it may be good to come in with some fresh blood and a new perspective,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. Intel said it was promoting three executives to become executive vice presidents: Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Brian Krzanich, who is chief operating officer and oversees manufacturing; and Stacy Smith, chief financial officer and director of corporate strategy. Smith, well-known by Wall Street, and Krzanich have in the past been viewed as potential CEOs. “There is a comfort level with Stacy (Smith),” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, made a name for himself improving the efficiency of the chipmaker’s cutting-edge factories. He was promoted to chief operating officer last March, effectively throwing him in the running for the post of CEO. Analysts said James’ focus on software instead of hardware made her less likely to be promoted to CEO. “Previous CEO transitions have all involved carefully groomed internal candidates. But if Intel’s board is now looking externally -- to bring in new skills -- that would explain the lack of a named successor and length of time in transition,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. Since most other chipmakers have closed down their fabrication plants over the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running plants that now cost upwards of $10 billion each to build. Armed with a bachelor’s degree in economics and an MBA from the University of California, Otellini began at Intel in 1974, when most of the company’s sales came from memory chips and before it turned to PC processors. He managed several business units before being appointed chief operating officer in 2002. The top chipmaker is currently running its factories at less than 50 percent of capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used for more cutting-edge production lines still being built. The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets. Its market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leads some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, to ask if Intel’s supremacy has come to an end and whether the company’s potential for profit and revenue growth may be limited.

2014-05-05,-3,"Intel’s previous CMO, Deborah Conrad, reported to the general manager of sales and marketing, Tom Kilroy, who is currently on medical leave. Fund is Krzanich’s first senior hire but only his latest shakeup at the chipmaker, which has been struggling with a shrinking PC industry and a lack of progress selling its products to makers of smartphones and tablets. “As our industry and our business is changing, we need to change the way we develop, build, and market our products, and Steve is going to be a key asset for us as we move forward,” Krzanich said in a statement on Monday. Fund, who was senior vice president of global marketing at Staples, also helped build brands at Procter & Gamble and at Pepsi-Cola, according to the statement. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. But Intel’s brand has lost a little of its shine in recent years. In 2013, Intel was No. 9 on consulting firm Interbrand’s global ranking, down from No. 7 in 2011. Conrad, a 27-year Intel veteran, left in March after Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion that the company needed to get some of the “coolness” back in its marketing. Intel in recent years has led personal computer makers in marketing sleek “ultrabook” laptops and two-in-one notebooks that convert into tablets. But those new gadgets have made little headway in stopping a decline in PC sales. Within days of being promoted to CEO last May, Krzanich reorganized Intel so that its main product groups would report directly to him. Kilroy is on leave fighting cancer and his duties are being covered by Greg Pearson, general manager of World Wide Sales and Operations. "

2015-01-15,2,"Global PC shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines.  That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize, but Intel did not deliver any spirited talk about a recovery on Thursday.  “In 2015 we’re predicting kind of flat, nothing spectacular but stable, is how I would call it,” Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters in an interview. Despite the tepid PC market, Intel is targeting revenue growth this year in the “mid-single digit percentage points”, which Smith said would be helped by faster growth in providing chips for data centers and Internet-connected gadgets. Optimism over a PC recovery has propelled Intel’s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P 500, to levels not seen since 2001.  In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. “The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. “PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,” Rolland added. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $3.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 27, from $2.6 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $13.8 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 66 cents per share on revenue of $14.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel shares were down 2.7 percent in after-hours trading at $35.28, after closing on Nasdaq at $36.19. "
2012-09-18,3,"LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Google’s Motorola Mobility unveiled its first smartphone handset to be powered by an Intel processor on Tuesday, featuring a wide screen and longer-life battery to better compete against Apple’s iPhone and Samsung. The Razr i will launch in Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany and Mexico in October, as the first handset of a multi-device agreement between the two groups. With a 4.3-inch display and Google’s Android platform, the Razr i is similar to the Razr M unveiled earlier in September for U.S. consumers, but its brain is an Intel processor instead of a chip made by Qualcomm. Choosing Intel’s chips is unusual in the smartphone and tablet industry, where energy-efficient processors made by Qualcomm and Samsung using technology licensed by British group ARM Holdings are widely favoured. Intel dominates the PC industry but has been slow to adapt its powerful processors to work well in battery-sensitive mobile gadgets and is now rushing to catch up. Motorola’s Andrew Morley, the general manager of Britain and Ireland, said the new chip enabled users to switch quickly between accessing the web, playing games, sending texts and activating the camera. The screen has virtually no border, so it also compares well in size to other rivals. ”This chipset gives us exactly what we want to launch in these markets,“ Morley told Reuters. ”It gives us the ability to create a compact device, it gives us speed and it’s a mid to high tier, mass market device. Motorola says the battery is 40 percent more powerful than Apple’s iPhone 4S and the camera can take 10 shots in under a second. There were no comparisons available with the new iPhone 5, which hits the shops later this month. The new Motorola phone uses a new version of Intel’s Medfield smartphone processor running at 2 Gigahertz, faster than the 1.6 GHz versions used in phones launched earlier this year by Orange in Britain, MegaFon in Russia and Lava International in India. Those phone launches were Intel’s first significant foray into the mobile market, and the Medfield chips used in them have performed better than many sceptics expected. The earlier Razr M includes Qualcomm technology compatible with high-speed Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks in the United States, while the Razr i is limited to slower 3G phone networks relied on more in Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Offering the similar Razr i and Razr M phones, powered by Intel and Qualcomm chips respectively, will create a new opportunity for investors to compare the performance of the two companies’ best chips. The combined market for PCs, smartphones and tablets is expected to almost double over the next four years, but Intel’s share of the processors used in them will dip from 35 percent to 29 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli."

2012-09-27,-4,"Intelinitially brushed off any threat from tablets such as Apple Inc’s iPad, but now hopes the combination of a low power consuming processor with touch friendly Microsoft Corp Windows 8 software will win over enterprise customers looking to deploy tablets, but keep PC-based software and hardware. The world’s largest chip maker says the “Atom Z2760” - formerly code named “Clover Trail” - is tailored to work with the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system, due in late October. Tablets that use both the Atom and Widows 8 will be able to run widely used software such as Word and Excel, while connecting to peripherals such as printers. It also lengthens battery life, enabling tablets to run 10-plus hours of streaming high-definition video, said Intel applications processor division chief Eric Reid. Targeting corporations and government agencies means the first wave of Intel-powered tablets and tablet-laptop hybrids will avoid the worst of the consumer war now raging between Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc. “These new Atom-based tablets have been targeted at spaces where Intel and Microsoft can win, the enterprise market, and as an alternative to a notebook,” said Patrick Moorhead, head of Moor Insights and Strategy. Dell Inc, Acer Inc, Asustek Computer Inc and ZTE Corp round out the half-dozen PC makers that trotted out their upcoming tablets, some of which sport a detachable keyboard or stylus designed to support free-form drawing and writing. “Every tablet shown today does what neither an iPad or Kindle Fire HD does well, which is creating content and controlling via a keyboard and trackpad,” he said. “This provides differentiation while not going head to head with Apple and Amazon.” With PC sales expected to stagnate over the next year or two, Intel hopes to make up for lost time and regain market share ceded to rivals such as Qualcomm Inc, Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp, whose applications processors now power most tablets except the iPad. Although the “Intel Inside” sticker remains affixed to 80 percent of the world’s PCs, the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. Analysts say the semiconductor industry leader has woken up to the tablet threat only in the past year. It is now rushing into the mobile market, motivated in part by slowing PC sales across consumer, businesses and even the emerging market segments it once relied on to propel sales. This month, it cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by a more than expected 8 percent and withdrew its full-year outlook entirely. Intel’s tablet strategy so far has focused on Windows 8 and its “x86” architecture found in most of the world’s PCs. But executives said this month that tablets running their processors and based on Google’s Android software are also in the works. Microsoft’s main assault on the tablet market involves Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 that works off the ARM Holdings chip designs that now dominate the market and drive the iPad and other mobile devices.

2012-10-08,-3,"McAfee spokesman Ian Bain said he could not provide more information about the planned job cuts, which the world’s No. 2 maker of anti-virus software disclosed in response to an inquiry from Reuters. Makers are of security software for personal computers are struggling in the midst of a PC industry slump. They could face increased pressure after October 26, when Microsoft Corp launches its Windows 8 operating software, which will be bundled with free anti-virus software. Symantec Corp, McAfee’s bigger rival in the anti-virus software market, is in the midst of a strategic review begun in July by the company’s new CEO, Steve Bennett, who took over in July after the board fired his predecessor. Cris Paden, a spokesman for Symantec, said the company had no job cuts to announce. “We evaluate conditions on an ongoing and regular basis and there are no plans as of right now,” Paden said. Intel Corp acquired McAfee, the world’s second-largest security software maker, in February 2011 for $7.7 billion. The division had 7,072 employees as of June 30, according to Bain. Intel is scheduled to release quarterly earnings on October 16, while Symantec plans to release its results on October 24. "
2012-06-18,-3,"InterDigital investors applauded the deal on Monday after some had questioned the company’s ability to finalize a patent sale after the company said in January that it had failed to find a buyer for the whole company but would keep looking for buyers for its patent portfolio. In July 2011, InterDigital said it was looking into a possible sale of the company or its patents in the hope that other big patent deals would boost its value. “This should reduce some of the executional overhang that was on the stock. The market was worried they wouldn’t meet this milestone,” said M Partners analyst Ron Shuttleworth. “They lost a lot of credibility once they had to cancel the process.” However, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that the $220,000 price per patent that Intel agreed to pay appeared to be much lower than previously announced patent deals. In comparison, Rasgon cited Nortel’s $4.5 billion patent sale last year that fetched $750,000 per patent and Google Inc’s recent $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, which implies a price of more than $735,000 per patent assuming a zero valuation for its cellphone hardware business. Rasgon said that the deal should fit well with Intel’s mobile strategy. “While we believe these new patents acquired from Interdigital should further bolster their position, we do not expect any changes to their wireless strategy as a result of the purchase,” Rasgon said in a research note. InterDigital also announced on Monday that its board had authorized a doubling of its share buyback authorization to $200 million from $100 million. It also said it was sticking by its revenue target of $71 million for the second quarter, including the sale of other patents for $9 million in a separate deal. The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter. Evercore Partners acted as InterDigital financial adviser and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich 7 Rosati acted as legal counsel. InterDigital shares were up $6.36 to $29.24 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. Intel shares, also on Nasdaq, rose 16 cents to $27.50. "

2012-04-25,-11,"The European Commission, which acts as EU competition regulator, penalized Intel with its largest ever corporate fine because of anticompetitive tactics against arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The decision came after an eight-year-long investigation. Intel will argue its case in a four-day hearing at the Luxembourg-based General Court on July 3 to 6, said two people familiar with the case. The company has said the fine, which represented 4.15 percent of its 2008 turnover, was “manifestly disproportionate”. EU regulators can penalize companies with fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenue. Intel has already gained backing from the European Ombudsman, who censured the Commission for procedural errors in its investigation. In his non-binding report issued five months after the regulatory finding, the Ombudsman said he had found “maladministration” because the regulator had failed to make a proper note of a meeting with computer maker Dell Inc during its probe.

2015-04-27,-1,"Altera did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Stockholders should have right to choose between Intel’s reported $54 cash offer and uncertain future of standalone Altera,” TIG Advisors said in a letter to Altera and shareholders. The firm also said it has spoken to many of the “core institutional” shareholders in Altera who also believe $54 is a compelling offer for the company.  Altera’s earnings report April 23 also disappointed investors with lower-than-expected results. Investors deserve a strategic plan from Altera that can deliver value to shareholders and can compete with Intel’s offer, TIG said.  Altera appeals to Intel for its line of programmable chips, increasingly used in data centers and customized for functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks, but talks have been off during the past few weeks.  Altera shares were trading 33 cents lower, down by 0.8 percent on Monday at $40.57 per share. It had a market capitalization of $12.27 billion on Monday, compared to Intel’s market value of $153.86 billion.  Worldwide semiconductor mergers and acquisitions were worth $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows. In the 12 months through March 2, four hundred seventy-two chip M&A deals were made worldwide, up from 383 in the previous year. "
2012-09-13,4,"“The problem with passwords -- we use too many of them, their rules are complex, and they differ for different websites,” Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs, said at the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Thursday. “There is a way out of it, and biometrics is an option.” Iyengar demonstrated the technology, quickly waving his hand in front of a tablet but not touching it. Once the tablet recognizes a user, it can securely communicate that person’s identity to banks, social networks and other services where the person has accounts, he said. Making laptops, tablets and smartphones responsible for identifying users would take that requirement away from individual websites and do away with the need to individually enter passwords into each of them, Iyengar said. “We plan to work with service providers to take full advantage of this,” he said. A device using the technology would use built-in accelerometers to detect when a user puts it down, and would then log its owner off to keep unauthorized people from getting in. The palm-identification technology was one of several demonstrations during a keynote address by Intel Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner at the forum. Rattner runs Intel Labs, which focuses on identifying and solving future technology problems. Rattner also showed prototype technology to improve cell-phone base stations and to efficiently and wirelessly connect devices such as printers, tablets and monitors throughout the home. He debuted a prototype microchip with wifi technology made with digital circuitry instead of analog, a development that has the potential to lead to major improvements in performance and efficiency. The palm-reading technology, still under development, requires new software and biometric sensors built into consumer devices, but does not require the development of any new kinds of chips, Rattner said. The technology works much better than the finger-print scanners found on some laptops today, he said. "
2012-11-08,-7,"Intel and HP held a news conference on Thursday announcing the availability of the newest version of Itanium and introducing new HP servers using the chips. HP will keep offering its customers choices between servers based on heavy-duty Itanium chips and Intel’s more widely used “x86” chips, said Ric Lewis, vice president and interim general manager of HP’s Business Critical Systems. Rory McInerney, vice president of Intel’s architecture group said that future Itanium chips would be built using some of the key features found in the company’s more widely used Xeon server processors. He did not say when future chips would be released. Once envisioned as a high-end processor that could become pervasive across the server industry, Itanium suffered a series of setbacks and was eventually overtaken by 64-bit chips based on Intel’s x86 architecture, which is now widely used in the PC industry. Software created for x86 servers is not compatible with Itanium servers, which are mostly sold by HP. Oracle has since said it would support Itanium servers. The dispute began after Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, which put Oracle into the server hardware business in competition against its partner, HP. Oracle had said it would no longer make new versions of its database software compatible with Itanium servers because the chip family was nearing the end of its life. Asked about the long-term viability of Itanium chips in an industry where x86 is dominant, Intel’s McInerney said, “I think that whole thing was litigated and I think the message back is that Oracle is supporting Itanium.” Codenamed Paulson, the new Itanium 9500 has up to 2.4 times the performance of the previous generation, has twice as many cores and consumes less power, McInerney said. HP’s Itanium-based servers are mostly used by large corporations with rigorous computing needs. "

2014-05-05,-7,"During a tool installation in a basement at the sprawling plant southeast of Phoenix a tube was severed, leading to a spill of around 100 gallons (379 liters) of ammonium hydroxide, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Ten workers near the spill reported to the facility’s medical station and two of those people were sent to hospital for observation, Mulloy said. The spill was in a confined area and no chemicals have been exposed to the public, he said. “The leak has ended. It has been contained. Right now they’re making plans for the cleanup,” Mulloy said. Chandler police spokesman Seth Tyler said fire department crews were called to the scene at about 1:30 p.m. local time after a report that there was “an incident with multiple injuries.” He said a construction crew working inside one of the buildings accidentally cut into a pipe. “During the construction process, a pipe was cut that feeds ammonium into a room in the basement,” he said. “The leak was immediately isolated.” Last June, a gas leak at the plant sickened 43 people, including 11 who were taken to a local hospital.

2013-05-02,-5,"The company said last November that it might go external for its next CEO, raising hopes that it might find someone to shake it out of recent doldrums. Seen as a frontrunner for the job since November, Krzanich inherits a company with margins of almost 60 percent that has all but extinguished rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in the past few years, and is now the dominant maker of microprocessors for computers and servers. But the company is in danger of finding itself sidelined as mobile devices such as tablets and ever more powerful smartphones accelerate a contraction of the personal computer market. The majority of gadgets today run processors based on rival ARM Holdings Plc’s power-saving chip architecture. “An external candidate might have been a better choice - with no negative reflection on Brian - simply because of the juncture Intel is at with what’s happening in the PC market and the need to take major action outside of PCs,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “Brian may very well come in and make those same very difficult dramatic choices, but it’s less likely.” He will take on the top job at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 16, replacing Paul Otellini. A relative unknown outside the tight-knit semiconductor industry, Krzanich has worked at Intel since 1982, rising to chief operating officer just over a year ago. The 52-year-old has earned a reputation for being a decisive leader who liked to keep a low profile. Intel on Thursday stressed that he will have a strong partner in James, who in 2011 spearheaded Intel’s $7.7 billion acquisition of No. 2 security software firm McAfee Inc. She ran software product and service sales as well as a team of engineers focused on improving the performance of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 and Google Inc’s Android software when run on the company’s microchips. Her elevation “puts emphasis on the many businesses Intel is in beyond just chips. This is an important promotion, and it clearly signals the board wants to make Intel a much broader company,” said Jack Gold, who runs research outfit Jack Gold Associates. Intel shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $24.11 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Over the past few months, media reports have mentioned several possible external candidates including Sanjay Jha, former head of Motorola’s mobile device division. Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said Krzanich is capable of effecting a transformational move. But he also said Krzanich and James made for an “extremely powerful” partnership, and that the pair had co-developed a long-term strategic vision for the company that won the board over. “They formed a partnership through the last few months that has blossomed into an extremely powerful pair,” he said. “You’ll see a fairly dramatic change over a period of time,” Bryant told Reuters in an interview. “If you look at Intel’s past, with every CEO we’ve had that.” Krzanich’s appointment comes at a crucial time for the company, which is gearing up for a transition in manufacturing processes to larger, 450 millimeter wafers, a gradual migration that may eventually trim production costs but which requires spending billions of dollars to upgrade facilities. And it is scrambling to finalize and launch next-generation processors - code-named “Haswell” - that it hopes will cut down on power consumption and close the gap with ARM-based rival chips, popular among mobile users who prioritize battery life. A chemical engineer by training who went to school in Northern California, Krzanich started with Intel in New Mexico as a process engineer before moving on to a series of factory management positions. He holds a patent for semiconductor processing and sits on the board of an industry association. He told Reuters in a 2012 interview his best work during his three-decade career included shortening turnaround times in the chipmaker’s factories. Intel announced in November that it was looking for a new CEO as Otellini announced plans to retire. The Santa Clara, California, company came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand. The company, which once said emerging markets could offset a dropoff in developed-world demand, orchestrated a push on pricey “Ultrabook” laptops that has so far failed to excite consumers. Last month, Intel warned that current-quarter revenue would fall as much as 8 percent, given the drop in PC sales. The company affirmed its full-year revenue growth target, but analysts think that forecast will be hard to hit. “Some investors preferred an external option on the belief that new blood was needed,” said Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann. But “the appointment is an indication that Intel will continue Paul Otellini’s strategy of building bigger, better fabs to attack the market.” "

Although the “Intel Inside” sticker remains affixed to 80 percent of the world’s PCs, the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. Analysts say the semiconductor industry leader has woken up to the tablet threat only in the past year. It is now rushing into the mobile market, motivated in part by slowing PC sales across consumer, businesses and even the emerging market segments it once relied on to propel sales. This month, it cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by a more than expected 8 percent and withdrew its full-year outlook entirely. Intel’s tablet strategy so far has focused on Windows 8 and its “x86” architecture found in most of the world’s PCs. But executives said this month that tablets running their processors and based on Google’s Android software are also in the works. Microsoft’s main assault on the tablet market involves Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 that works off the ARM Holdings chip designs that now dominate the market and drive the iPad and other mobile devices.

2014-08-13,0,"The initial goal is to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor patients remotely and store that data in an open system that can be accessed by scientists.  In the next phase of the study, which will likely kick off in the fall, the foundation will set aside funds to explore how patients are responding to medication. Participants will be monitored via an array of wearable devices.  “As more of these devices hit the market, we can collect objective measurements and determine the efficacy of new therapeutics,” Sohini Chowdhury, a senior vice president for research partnerships at the foundation, told Reuters.  Clinical trials have been far too “subjective” in the past, she said. For instance, a patient might inform her doctor that she felt a tremor for several minutes, when it actually lasted a matter of seconds. In the future, Chowdhury hopes patients and their doctors will have more precise measurements via wearable devices about the “frequency and severity” of symptoms.  Chowdhury said the foundation will continue to raise funding to cover the costs of providing wearable devices to patients. By using such devices, the foundation and other research groups can tap into a broader pool of patients for clinical trials, Chowdhury said. Today, many people with Parkinson’s disease are unable to participate in clinical trials because they do not live near a research facility. But wearable devices offer a convenient way to track patients from their work or homes, allowing people in the most rural parts of the country to participate.  As it expands beyond the PC arena, Intel hopes to capture a share of the growing market for big data analytics and wearable devices in the health sector. Ron Kasabian, general manager of Intel’s Big Data Solutions group, said the data center and “Internet of Things” business units are exploring the sector.  “We’re exploring how to pull data out of devices in real-time,” he said. “We can mine data to improve research, and better understand the behaviors and progression of the disease.”  While Intel boasts its own wearable technologies, Kasabian stressed that the Parkinson’s study is device agnostic, meaning patients can test a variety of wearable gadgets. In March, Intel completed its acquisition of Basis Science, a startup that is best known for its wrist-band that measures the wearer’s heart rate.  Intel expects to extend similar programs to related areas of health care, as well as other industries, including manufacturing. "
2015-03-19,0,"The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model. It is the company’s first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.   The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets. “We believe wearable technology will take off,” Michael Bell, vice president of Intel’s New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair. Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica (LUX.MI), watchmaker Fossil (FOSL.O), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony. “Tag Heuer’s decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said. “With Apple Watch hitting the market it’s no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.” Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group Kering (PRTP.PA) gave no details of pricing or launch timing. Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however. Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group UHR.VX watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch. “The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,” he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday. Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult. "
2016-08-17,-2,"Analysts said the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel’s Director of Process Architecture and a familiar figure in the industry, were no cause for alarm, but shares fell 4.5 percent to 93.54 euros by 1130 GMT in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Intel holds a 15 percent stake in ASML and is a key customer for its lithography machines which use focused light beams to map out the circuitry of computer chips. Speaking at an event in San Francisco, Bohr said Intel would initially rely on older ASML tools at Intel’s 7 nm fabrication plants, switching only to ASML’s newest EUV tools when they are deemed ready. EUV stands for “extreme ultraviolet”-range light waves. ASML dominates the market for lithography machines, but it is counting on adoption of the EUV machines -- which can cost up to 100 million euros ($113 million) each -- to increase sales to a target of 10 billion euros by 2020. Bernstein analysts said Bohr’s comments did not appear to mark a major change. “Intel would never bet unequivocally on an unproven technology,” Stacy Ragson wrote in a note on Intel’s presentation. “Dr. Bohr’s comments, while perhaps a bit more direct than what might have been perceived before, should not have been surprising.” Bernstein rates ASML shares “Outperform”. ASML still expects EUV machines to enter production in 2018 and be running at full volume by 2019, company spokesman Lucas van Grinsven said. Analyst Jos Versteeg from Dutch private bank Theodoor Gilissen, said Wednesday’s share decline presented investors with a “nice purchasing moment.” “Even if EUV were delayed, that wouldn’t be bad for ASML’s results, given that many more (current generation) systems would have to be sold” to compensate, he said. ASML is on Gilissen’s  list of “Recommended” stocks.  ($1 = 0.8872 euros)   (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Keith Weir)"

2016-07-01,0,"Now carmakers are increasingly striking up partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles.  ”Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on Friday at a joint news conference announcing the alliance. The three companies said their new platform would be made available to multiple carmakers and they expected vehicles with highly and fully-automated driving would be brought into mass production by 2021. It is too early to say which other carmakers would join the alliance, BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said at a news conference on the outskirts of Munich on Friday. Sophisticated cruise control systems already enable “hands off” driving as cameras and computers allow cars to automatically brake, steer and accelerate in traffic at low speeds. But drivers are required to stay in control.  Now BMW, Intel and Mobileye will develop cars with even higher levels of automation described as “eyes off,” “mind off,” and “driver off”. This requires much more computing power and software know-how, forcing traditional carmakers to collaborate more closely with technology specialists. Both industries see huge revenue opportunities in the market for autonomous vehicles, although it is unclear how many drivers will be prepared to relinquish control and how quickly laws will be put in place to allow fully autonomous vehicles on the roads. But creating common technology standards would help all manufacturers update their vehicles faster, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said. “That will be critical for advancing the safety aspects of this.”  A common approach to standards will also make it easier for regulators to understand and approve the roadworthiness of a vehicle while still leaving enough scope for individual car manufacturers to customize their cars, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said. Beyond technological hurdles there are legal questions over who is responsible when a crash occurs. On Thursday, the driver of a Tesla Model S car, operating in Autopilot mode, was killed in a collision with a truck in the United States, prompting an investigation by federal highway safety regulators.  When asked about the crash, BMW CEO Harald Krueger said: “The accident is very sad .... We believe today the technologies are not ready for series production,” he added, explaining the alliance had not forecast that until 2021. “For the BMW group, safety comes first,” he said.  As part of the new alliance, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker which has been looking to expand into the automotive electronics market, will supply the microprocessors - or central processing units - to control an array of sensors. Auto camera and software maker Mobileye will supply its Road Experience Management (REM) technology and make its latest EyeQ5 chip available to be deployed on Intel computing platforms. The three companies said they would demonstrate their technology in a prototype in the near future. "

The unit, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc (LOTC), posted $1 billion in cash collateral to Intel also as part of the agreement. The agreement specified that Intel would be compensated for losses in case of early termination of the deal. According to the filing, Intel maintained that Lehman was to deliver “$1 billion in Intel common stock,” but Lehman argued that the agreement was to deliver 50.5 million of Intel shares irrespective of the dollar value. “The value of 50,552,943 shares of Intel common stock on Sept. 29, 2008 was about $873 million, not $1 billion,” Lehman said. Intel terminated the agreement two weeks after the company’s bankruptcy filing on Sept. 15, 2008, and seized the entire $1 billion in collateral and has not returned it, Lehman said in the filing. By seizing the collateral in its entirety, Lehman said “Intel breached the swap agreement.” Lehman is looking to recover from Intel an unspecified amount to be determined at trial.

2013-07-22,-5,"Intel has already launched a line of its Atom mobile chips that are tweaked to work as low-power server chips. The announcement, which was made on Monday at an event with industry analysts and media, means Intel will go a step further by offering a low-power version of its powerful Xeon processor with built-in features including connectivity and memory. It also reflects the willingness of CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over in May, to make major changes to how Intel approaches its different markets. By launching lower-power chips for servers, Intel is trying to stay ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, Applied Micro Circuits Corp and other smaller rivals hoping to disrupt the top chipmaker’s dominance of the data center with upcoming components designed with low-power smartphone technology licensed from ARM Holdings. “Intel’s announcements demonstrate they will try to defend their turf against ARM-based servers and specialty processors,” said Pat Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “Up until today, it was a bit of a guessing game for Intel that today has at least 95-percent server market share.” Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business,  said the new component, based on the upcoming Broadwell version of Intel’s Xeon high-performance chips, will launch next year. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. The new version of Broadwell is part of Intel’s move to integrate more features onto its chips, like memory and graphics. “System on chips,” as they are known, are already widely used in smartphones and tablets, but less in the data center. Intel is also beginning to make “system on chips” for laptops. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but it was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous."

2014-03-27,3,"Intel said the stake in Cloudera is its largest data center technology investment ever, although it did not disclose the size of the deal. Cloudera, like rivals HortonWorks and Pivotal, focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through “Hadoop,” an open-source software system that can sort and handle the massive amounts of information, increasingly called Big Data, generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel said it will promote Cloudera’s Hadoop platform and transition away from its own customized version that it had been promoting as optimal for Intel server chips. Cloudera will now engineer its Hadoop offerings to work best with Intel’s server chip technology, which enjoys around 94 percent market share in data centers. Intel will have a seat on the board of directors of Cloudera, which is widely expected to go public this year. Shares of Intel were unchanged at $25.38. Intel hopes that encouraging more companies to leap into Big Data analysis will lead to higher sales of its high-end Xeon server processors. With Intel’s core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming a larger component of the company’s profits. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Big Data is also a key part of the Internet of Things, a term referring to the increasing connectivity of everyday devices from cars to smoke alarms. Finding ways to analyze and make use of vast amounts of data collected by those smart devices is becoming a major opportunity for IT companies including Intel. After falling behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel aims to make sure it is a major player in the Internet of Things by supplying processors used in new devices as well as the server hardware and software used to analyze the data those devices create. “Hadoop, as the data platform, and the investment we are making together to make sure it’s the platform of choice, becomes the connection between those two major initiatives at Intel: the Internet of Things and the data center,” Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, said on a webcast. Intel’s investment comes after Cloudera said last week raised $160 million from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and other investors. "
2013-05-06,2,"The new microarchitecture, code-named Silvermont, will be a key building block in upcoming Intel chips for mobile gadgets, microservers and car entertainment systems, Chief Product Officer Dadi Perlmutter told reporters at an event on Monday. “We have not only reduced the power in a significant manner but it comes with significant performance,” Perlmutter said. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry but the company has struggled to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm. The Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used a range of car models with different features, Perlmutter said. He said it offers up to three times more computing performance than current chips and as much as five times lower power consumption. Qualcomm and other mobile chipmakers design their processors using power-efficient technology licensed from Intel-rival ARM Holdings. Intel introduced its Atom mobile processors for netbooks in 2008 and they have so far failed to be widely adopted in smartphones and tablets despite improvements made to them. Silvermont will be the basis for Intel’s 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips due out later this year and Intel says it will more than double the performance of its current tablet chips. It will also be used in Intel’s upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips and Avoton chips for microservers. While Silvermont improves the performance of Intel’s processors, the Santa Clara, California company faces other major challenges in mobile. It has fallen behind in launching chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line."
2014-05-29,0,"Far behind rival Qualcomm in mobile devices, the upcoming tablets are the result of Intel Corp’s  strategy to sell chips this year at a loss in a bid to stake out badly needed market share. Intel is betting that in the future, its customers will keep using Intel chips without the discounts. Toshiba this week announced six tablets and PCs with detachable screens made with Intel chips, one of which runs the Android operating system and the rest Windows. More Intel-based tablets will start hitting U.S. store shelves in June and July for back-to-school shoppers, Erik Reid, general manager of Intel’s Mobile Client Platforms unit, told Reuters in a recent interview. “It will be a new high-water mark, to be eclipsed by another high-water mark at the holidays,” said Reid, who is managing Intel’s tablet push. With the PC industry shrinking, mobile devices and other new markets have become a top priority for Intel. Most tablets are made with chips from Samsung, Qualcomm and other companies that use low-power technology from ARM Holdings . Earlier in May, CEO Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel was well on its way to reaching his goal for the company to increase its sales of tablet chips this year to 40 million units. After shipping 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter, Intel is on track to meet a target of 7.5 million such chips for the June quarter, Krzanich said. “We’re on schedule to hit that number and we’ll see if we can do better than that,” he said. Global tablet shipments from all manufacturers in 2014 will grow 12 percent to 245 million, less than a previous forecast of 261 million devices, because people are keeping their devices longer, market research firm IDC said on Thursday. Intel sold around 10 million tablet chips last year. Manufacturers have launched a handful of Windows tablets running on Intel’s newest Bay Trail chips, but those chips have been slow to appear in devices running the popular Android platform. On Tuesday, Intel announced a deal with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip to make components for entry-level Android devices aimed at local consumers in China. Partly reflecting the financial incentives Intel is offering manufacturers to use its tablet chips, the company’s mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $929 million in the April quarter on revenue of only $156 million. As well as big PC brands increasingly making tablets, Intel expects small manufacturers making devices for China’s domestic market to play a major part in reaching its 40 million chip goal this year, Reid said. “We’re confident, but this is by no means saying it’s in the bank.”   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
2015-03-02,-7,"Responding to a growing market in China for low-cost handsets often priced below $100, Intel announced plans for the chip, code named Sofia, in late 2013 at a meeting with investors. “We went from PowerPoint to shipping in 15 months,” said Aicha Evans, General Manager of Intel’s Platform Engineering Group. As well as smartphones, the Sofia chip fills a gap in Intel’s lineup of chips for tablets. Over 20 manufactures plan to make devices made with Sofia, with many on display at this week’s Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain, Evans said. After falling behind in mobile chips, Intel has been rushing to catch up with Qualcomm Inc and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc . Qualcomm said on Monday it will start testing its newest top-tier smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 820, with manufacturers in late 2015. In a costly strategy that elevated Intel to the No 2 spot in tablet chip market share, Intel last year paid manufacturers some of the engineering cost of developing low-end tablets using another chip, code named Bay Trail, that it originally had designed for more expensive devices. Intel has declined to say how much it paid tablet makers to use its Bay Trail chips, but it’s mobile unit had a loss of $4.2 billion last year, worse than its $3.1 billion loss in 2013. Intel believes the new Sofia chips are ideal for the fast-growing, low-end smartphone market in Asia and has said it does not plan to use costly subsidies to sell the chips this year. The Sofia chips currently shipping have 3G features for low-end phones, and 4G versions for pricier smartphones will be released later this year, the company added.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich.

In a major divergence from its core business of manufacturing chips for PCs, Intel plans to sell consumers a television set-top box that offers live programming as well as on-demand content in small bundles. It will compete with heavyweights like Apple Inc, Amazon Inc and Google Inc that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The service, announced in February, would go further than products currently offered by Apple, Netflix and others. But some media executives and analysts have been skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make the service viable. Carvill declined to comment on the progress of content negotiations other than to say Intel is engaged with partners and remains confident it will launch later this year. Intel Media, led by former BBC executive Erik Huggers, is looking for engineers experienced in cloud computing, user interface design and security. Intel also wants specialists in Hadoop, a platform used for mining vast troves of digital data. That could point toward a heavy emphasis on analyzing customers’ viewing habits. Huggers has said the product’s set-top box will include a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. One job ad on Intel’s website is for an “audience representative” who would be responsible for communicating with customers via phone, chat, email, and possibly video. Among the qualifications, “Must be weird.” "
2013-07-22,-5,"The announcement, which was made on Monday at an event with industry analysts and media, means Intel will go a step further by offering a low-power version of its powerful Xeon processor with built-in features including connectivity and memory. It also reflects the willingness of CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over in May, to make major changes to how Intel approaches its different markets. By launching lower-power chips for servers, Intel is trying to stay ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, Applied Micro Circuits Corp and other smaller rivals hoping to disrupt the top chipmaker’s dominance of the data center with upcoming components designed with low-power smartphone technology licensed from ARM Holdings. “Intel’s announcements demonstrate they will try to defend their turf against ARM-based servers and specialty processors,” said Pat Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “Up until today, it was a bit of a guessing game for Intel that today has at least 95-percent server market share.” Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, said the new component, based on the upcoming Broadwell version of Intel’s Xeon high-performance chips, will launch next year. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. The new version of Broadwell is part of Intel’s move to integrate more features onto its chips, like memory and graphics. “System on chips,” as they are known, are already widely used in smartphones and tablets, but less in the data center. Intel is also beginning to make “system on chips” for laptops. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but it was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. "
2014-05-27,4,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Tuesday it reached an agreement with Chinese mobile chipmaker Rockchip to make chips for inexpensive tablets running Google Inc’s Android platform. The deal teams Intel up with a chipmaker specializing in  low-end mobile devices that often cost less than $100 and are popular in China and other fast-growing markets. This represents a major move for the Santa Clara, California company that has struggled to gain traction in smartphones and tablets. The collaboration is unlikely to drastically increase Intel’s overall mobile chip business, but it shows the chipmaker’s determination to be successful in the mobile arena at nearly any cost, said FBR analyst Chris Rolland. “It speaks to (CEO Brian Krzanich) being willing to think somewhat out of the box and be a little more flexible in his approach,” Rolland said. Intel gains access to Rockchip’s ability to quickly launch inexpensive mobile chips as well as access to the company’s strong relationships with local Chinese manufacturers focused on the country’s fast-growing consumer market. “They’re absolutely bringing us speed and execution and proliferation for us that would not otherwise get done,” Krzanich said on a conference call. “They also bring these relationships and partnerships that go well beyond what ours are.” With sales of high-end mobile devices losing steam in North America, manufacturers have been turning their attention to lower-end tablets and smartphones designed for consumers in China. Under the agreement, Rockchip and Intel will make a quad-core mobile chip using Intel’s architecture and branding, Intel said. While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips,” or SoCs, that combine features like modems, wifi and memory. Fuzhou, China-based Rockchip and other mobile chipmakers focus on making SoCs for smartphones and tablets. Those chips typically include ARM processor technology that competes against Intel’s technology. “It’s to some degree an acknowledgement of Intel’s limited capability in SoCs and very limited presence in China, particularly as you get cheaper and cheaper tablets,” Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree said of the agreement with Rockchip. Intel said the agreement with Rockchip does not include an investment between the two companies. Intel said the chip will include 3G connectivity and be available in the first half of 2015. Shares of Intel were up 1.22 percent at $26.60, in line with trading levels ahead of the announcement.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang and Cynthia Osterman)"
2014-03-27,3,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Thursday it made a significant investment in Cloudera and will make the fast-growing startup its preferred distributor of software for crunching Big Data. The top chipmaker said its equity investment in Cloudera makes it the company’s single largest strategic shareholder and it comes as Intel looks to expand its server business to make up for falling sales of personal computers. Intel said the stake in Cloudera is its largest data center technology investment ever, although it did not disclose the size of the deal. Cloudera, like rivals HortonWorks and Pivotal, focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through “Hadoop,” an open-source software system that can sort and handle the massive amounts of information, increasingly called Big Data, generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel said it will promote Cloudera’s Hadoop platform and transition away from its own customized version that it had been promoting as optimal for Intel server chips. Cloudera will now engineer its Hadoop offerings to work best with Intel’s server chip technology, which enjoys around 94 percent market share in data centers. Intel will have a seat on the board of directors of Cloudera, which is widely expected to go public this year. Shares of Intel were unchanged at $25.38. Intel hopes that encouraging more companies to leap into Big Data analysis will lead to higher sales of its high-end Xeon server processors. With Intel’s core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming a larger component of the company’s profits. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Big Data is also a key part of the Internet of Things, a term referring to the increasing connectivity of everyday devices from cars to smoke alarms. Finding ways to analyze and make use of vast amounts of data collected by those smart devices is becoming a major opportunity for IT companies including Intel. After falling behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel aims to make sure it is a major player in the Internet of Things by supplying processors used in new devices as well as the server hardware and software used to analyze the  data those devices create. “Hadoop, as the data platform, and the investment we are making together to make sure it’s the platform of choice, becomes the connection between those two major initiatives at Intel: the Internet of Things and the data center,” Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, said on a webcast. Intel’s investment comes after Cloudera said last week raised $160 million from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and other investors.    (Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Andrew Hay)"
2012-12-04,-2,"Intel was offering the bonds in a range of maturities from five years to 30 years, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit. Intel said in a filing it plans to use proceeds of the debt sale for general corporate purposes and for stock buybacks under its existing share authorization. “We believe the action should likely prove prudent given low debt borrowing costs,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said of the debt offer in a note to clients. “In our view the raise will likely support increased buybacks.” Intel’s stock has dropped 18 percent over the past year as investors worried about slow PC sales and the company’s failure to expand into mobile gadgets. It’s shares were up 2.3 percent at $20.00 on Tuesday. “The cost of money is relatively inexpensive and we have an excellent credit rating. It’s sound financial planning,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy."

The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart AMD by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC and Lenovo  for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. "
2012-12-11,0,"The Atom chip rolled out on Tuesday uses much less electricity than Intel’s previous processors for servers and comes as Intel’s rivals also eye the low-power server niche. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money, and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. But Internet giants like Facebook, Amazon.Com and Google have been experimenting with ways to use low-power chips to make their data centers more efficient. At an Intel event launching the Atom chips, a Facebook infrastructure executive said the social network has found that low-power chips excel at processing the 4.5 billion updates, likes, posts and comments its 1 billion active users add to the site every day. “We do face unprecedented scale at Facebook, and that’s one of the reasons we’re so highly motivated to figure out the most efficient way to scale infrastructure efficiently and support all the people using Facebook,” said Frank Frankovsky, Facebook’s VP of hardware design and supply chain. He did not say whether Facebook expects to buy Intel’s new chips. Frankovsky said “wimpy” low-power chips in some cases can do the same work as Intel’s “brawny” Xeon chips while consuming half or a third as much power. “How much useful work can you get done per watt per dollar? That’s the only metric that matters,” Frankovsky said. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. In October, ARM unveiled new chip designs aimed at microservers. ARM believes servers using low-power chips based on its designs could account for a fifth of data centers by 2020. Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, declined to say how large Intel believes the microserver market could become. She said the Atom chips have been chosen for over 20 upcoming products focused on microservers, storage and communications."
2013-02-17,3,"Intel’s exports, which rose 109 percent from $2.2 billion in 2011, were boosted by the start of production of chips using 22 nanometre technology at its Kiryat Gat plant in southern Israel, which is now operating at full capacity. Intel, the world’s No. 1 chipmaker, will build chips over the next two to three years with features measuring just 14 nm in Ireland and the United States but the company is already thinking about where it will produce 10 nm chips. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. Intel Israel executives said they would like to see 10 nm production in Israel. “The average life of a technology is two to six years so we need to be busy to get the next technology, 10 nanometre,” Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told a news conference on Sunday. “We need to get a decision far enough in advance to be able to upgrade the plant. So for 10 nanometre, decisions will need to be made this year.” Fassberg said upgrading the existing Fab 28 plant in Israel would require a lower investment than building a new plant but would still involve several billion dollars. Intel Israel has in the past received government grants to help with the costs of its investments and Fassberg told Reuters the company was “constantly in talks with the government”. Intel has invested $10.5 billion in Israel in the past decade, including $1.1 billion in 2012, and has received $1.3 billion in government grants. The company accounted for 20 percent of Israel’s high-tech exports last year and 10 percent of its industrial exports, excluding diamonds. “If Intel had not increased its exports, Israel’s high-tech exports would have shrunk by 10 percent,” Intel Israel President Mooly Eden said. Most of Intel Israel’s exports - $3.5 billion - came from its chip manufacturing activities. Intel is Israel’s largest private employer, with 8,542 workers, up 10 percent from 2011. The company has two plants - in Jerusalem and Kiryat Gat - as well as four research and development centres. Eden said Intel was also committed to investing in start-ups, having invested in 64 Israeli companies since 1996. In July its global investment arm Intel Capital said it would expand its operations in Israel."
2016-03-11,-1,"The portfolio comprises companies across the globe and is part of the company’s corporate venture unit, Intel Capital, according to the report. Intel declined to comment, while UBS was not immediately available for comment.     Intel was open to selling the assets as a whole or divided by geography or sectors, the sources told Bloomberg, adding that talks over the structure were at an early stage. "
2013-08-23,-1,"Opening the offices is a sign that Intel is committed to moving ahead with the venture even though progress making deals has been slow. Some industry insiders have expressed doubts about Intel’s ability to successfully create a business to challenge traditional cable operators. “It suggests that there’s an ongoing level of interest, maybe an incremental positive to their commitment,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “They have to continue down this path or there’s no hope of being successful.” Intel plans to introduce the TV service, to be delivered through the Internet and a set-top box, this year in a phased rollout in regional markets, Carvill said. In July, Intel Media hired Moe Khosravy, a cloud-computing expert who previously worked at Microsoft Corp and VMWare Inc, as head of software and user experiences. Intel has about 375 people working on the TV business, most of them based at Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing. Some content providers have agreed with Intel about how their content would be distributed, but as of June the chipmaker had yet to sign any deals despite offering to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Carvill declined to comment on Intel’s negotiations. Intel is not the only technology company trying to revolutionize the TV industry, where Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc and DirecTV are players and have much to lose from potential new entrants. Apple Inc, Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc are believed to be working on their own new TV services and products. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, it can expect to pay a premium. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Intel Media head Erik Huggers has billed it as a premium product, with small bundles of channels and an attractive user interface rather than as a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions.

2012-05-10,-3,"Shares of Cisco, which relies on government and corporate spending on Internet gear, dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, a day after the company released its financial results. “I think John’s comments were focused on Europe in particular. We haven’t seen any change in Europe demand on the enterprise side,” Otellini said. Much of the presentations by Otellini and other Intel executives showcased the chipmaker’s long-awaited push into smartphones as well as ultra-thin laptops. Intel offered little new hope to investors concerned about languid PC sales. Otellini also forecast that Intel, with its deep pockets, would survive as one of a handful of leading-edge chip manufacturers as the sector moves toward larger and costlier factories. With the industry preparing to increase the size of the silicon wafers it uses, letting manufacturers fit more chips on each, future leading-edge factories will cost more than $10 billion each to build, compared with about $5 billion now, Otellini said. Intel, Samsung Electronics and contract manufacturer TSMC will be among the few companies able to build those larger factories and keep them working full time, experts have said. Reflecting higher costs in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, Intel is boosting its capital spending this year to $12.5 billion from about $10.8 billion in 2011. “When you see a capex of ten or twelve billion you say, ‘Oh my god.’ But you forget that our (annual) revenue is approaching $60 billion,” Otellini told an analyst who questioned Intel’s higher spending. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said he expects gross margins next year to remain at the high end of Intel’s recent historical range of 60 percent to 65 percent. Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor, and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Before declaring that Intel is a serious player in the mobile market, many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete have fueled gains in its shares in recent months. Major manufacturers like Asus and Hewlett Packard are launching ultrabooks, but some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, in charge of the ultrabook push, said the laptops are aimed at prices starting at $700. He said consumers would be willing to spend more than normal on PCs delivering premium features. Demonstrations of future gadgets, including an ultrabook with a touchscreen display, won polite applause. But analysts said they heard little to reduce concerns that Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to make ultrabooks affordable and help drive sales. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for its new Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Global PC shipments in the first quarter grew a tepid 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, according to research firm Gartner. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year. "
2013-11-21,2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on Thursday he would expand his company’s small contract manufacturing business, paving the way for more chipmakers to tap into the world’s most advanced process technology. With Intel far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, many on Wall Street have urged the company to expand its contract manufacturing business, which currently contributes little to its overall revenue, and to open its factories to high-volume clients making mobile processors. “We’re going to go much further. If we can utilize our silicon to provide the best computing, we’ll do that,” Krzanich told analysts. “People who can use our leading edge and build computing capabilities that are better than anyone else‘s, those are good candidates for our foundry service.” Intel shares jumped more than 2.5 percent by the end of trading on Thursday. At his first annual investor day since taking over as chief executive in May, Krzanich said the slumping personal computer industry, Intel’s core market, was showing signs of bottoming out. “Our view is that it’s declining but it’s beginning to show signs of stabilization,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said global PC shipments are likely to decline slightly next year as consumers in emerging markets favor tablets. Intel’s revenues next year will be flat, with lower PC sales offsetting more server sales, he said. Krzanich said that during his six-month tenure as CEO, Intel improved its chip offerings for tablet makers. He pledged to quadruple the number of tablets with Intel chips in 2014. Tablets with Intel chips would range in price from less than $100 to more than $400, he said, adding he recently gave every Intel board member a $149 Android tablet made with an Intel chip to demonstrate the progress the company was making in mobile. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Intel shareholders and its board are betting that Krzanich, a veteran from Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing operation who replaced retiring CEO Paul Otellini, will be able to steer the company back on track. “When we began our search for the CEO a year ago ... I was embarrassed that we had lost our way,” Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said at the event. Krzanich pointed to SoFIA, a low-end version, as an example of Intel’s new pragmatism and willingness to change how it does business. He said that in the interest of speed, SoFIA would initially be manufactured outside of Intel, with the goal of bringing it to market next year. Intel will later move production of SoFIA chips to its own cutting-edge 14 nanometer manufacturing lines, Krzanich said. As PC sales shrink, Krzanich sees an opportunity to fill idle production lines while earning new revenue. Thursday’s announcement shows he is much more willing than his predecessor, Otellini, to open Intel’s factories to a wide range of companies, including potential competitors. “Wow,” Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note to clients. “It’s very refreshing to see Intel make this move and could have important implications for the industry.” Intel could end up acting as manufacturing components on behalf of rivals like graphics chipmaker Nvidia or even dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm, Mosesmann wrote. Those companies currently rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, or TSMC, the leading contract chip manufacturer, known in the industry as a foundry. “In foundry, we’re extending our capabilities and we’re open for business.” said Intel President Renee James, even with competitors, she added. Otellini agreed early this year for Intel to manufacture programmable chips on behalf of Altera, a Silicon Valley neighbor it does not compete with. That deal, seen as allowing Intel to eventually take on larger customers, spurred speculation that Intel could do a much bigger deal to make iPhone or iPad chips for Apple, which currently depends on Samsung to manufacture its chips. Responding to consumer preferences, Intel plans to drastically increase its investment in chips for the fast-growing tablet market while trimming investments in the company’s core PC processor business, Smith said. Shares of Intel closed up 2.7 percent at $25.23."

2013-05-16,0,"Krzanich took over as chief executive at Intel’s annual shareholders meeting, replacing Paul Otellini, who in November unexpectedly announced his plan to retire. Under Otellini, Intel has been sidelined in smartphones and tablets while demand for its PC processors is on the wane. “Yes, we missed it, we were slow to tablets and some of the mobile computing. We do believe we have a good base,” Krzanich told shareholders at an annual meeting. Krzanich, a 30-year Intel veteran who made his name running Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing plants, said he and software honcho Renee James, who the board elevated to president, have already started meeting with manufacturing customers. “They’re all showing us - here’s where the market’s moving and here’s where we need Intel to move,” Krzanich said. “We’re going to make adjustments in our architecture and our product choices.” Intel for decades has called the shots in the personal computer industry but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Intel’s strength has traditionally come from its manufacturing prowess, and Krzanich’s promotion is seen as confirmation by the board that the company’s multibillion-dollar network of cutting-edge factories still holds the key to success. James’ promotion underscores a belief in Intel that software and other related services are also important ingredients. “I think the emphasis is important,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said of Krzanich’s remarks. “A focus on the end-customer, a focus on execution and a really strong focus on the ultra-mobile segment of the business. That’s pretty important,” Smith told Reuters. Last week, Intel unveiled the most extensive overhaul to date of its Atom mobile processors that underpin its push into smartphones and tablets. Intel’s processors have been used in a handful of smartphones in Asia, Africa and Europe but the company has yet to release Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s   iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line."

2012-09-07,-7,"* Company says forming new tablet software team * Upcoming Windows launch central to its strategy By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp  is recruiting for a new software team focused on tablets, according to a new job ad, underscoring the top chipmaker’s efforts to expand beyond the lackluster PC industry. The company plans to fill several senior positions this month on the team, which will have responsibility for technology architecture as well as marketing and dealing with suppliers and customers, according to the ad Intel posted Thursday on social networking site LinkedIn. The chipmaker’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and it trails Qualcomm Inc  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Intel spokeswoman Kathy Gill said Intel is constantly hiring and that the jobs advertised this week would expand Intel’s existing bench of tablet software experts. Although mainly a manufacturer, Intel sees focusing in-house on software as increasingly important to making sure its chips work efficiently. The company says in the ad it was looking for people with several years experience in Windows, wireless and cameras. With consumers increasingly turning to mobile devices, Intel cut its third-quarter revenue estimate on Friday, pointing to declining demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer PCs. Intel has been preparing for months for the launch of tablets running Microsoft’s new Windows 8 platform. Due for launch in late October, Windows 8 offers touch-screen features and is central to Intel’s tablet strategy. Device manufacturers are working on more than 20 potential Windows 8 tablets powered by Intel’s Clover Trail mobile chip as well as others using recently launched PC processors, Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call in July.

2014-05-29,1,"Toshiba (6502.T) this week announced six tablets and PCs with detachable screens made with Intel chips, one of which runs the Android operating system and the rest Windows. More Intel-based tablets will start hitting U.S. store shelves in June and July for back-to-school shoppers, Erik Reid, general manager of Intel’s Mobile Client Platforms unit, told Reuters in a recent interview. “It will be a new high-water mark, to be eclipsed by another high-water mark at the holidays,” said Reid, who is managing Intel’s tablet push.  With the PC industry shrinking, mobile devices and other new markets have become a top priority for Intel. Most tablets are made with chips from Samsung (005930.KS), Qualcomm and other companies that use low-power technology from ARM Holdings ARM.L. Earlier in May, CEO Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel was well on its way to reaching his goal for the company to increase its sales of tablet chips this year to 40 million units. After shipping 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter, Intel is on track to meet a target of 7.5 million such chips for the June quarter, Krzanich said. “We’re on schedule to hit that number and we’ll see if we can do better than that,” he said. Global tablet shipments from all manufacturers in 2014 will grow 12 percent to 245 million, less than a previous forecast of 261 million devices, because people are keeping their devices longer, market research firm IDC said on Thursday. Intel sold around 10 million tablet chips last year. Manufacturers have launched a handful of Windows tablets running on Intel’s newest Bay Trail chips, but those chips have been slow to appear in devices running the popular Android platform. On Tuesday, Intel announced a deal with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip to make components for entry-level Android devices aimed at local consumers in China.  Partly reflecting the financial incentives Intel is offering manufacturers to use its tablet chips, the company’s mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $929 million in the April quarter on revenue of only $156 million. As well as big PC brands increasingly making tablets, Intel expects small manufacturers making devices for China’s domestic market to play a major part in reaching its 40 million chip goal this year, Reid said.  “We’re confident, but this is by no means saying it’s in the bank.” "

Over 20 manufactures plan to make devices made with Sofia, with many on display at this week’s Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain, Evans said. After falling behind in mobile chips, Intel has been rushing to catch up with Qualcomm Inc and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. Qualcomm said on Monday it will start testing its newest top-tier smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 820, with manufacturers in late 2015. In a costly strategy that elevated Intel to the No 2 spot in tablet chip market share, Intel last year paid manufacturers some of the engineering cost of developing low-end tablets using another chip, code named Bay Trail, that it originally had designed for more expensive devices.  Intel has declined to say how much it paid tablet makers to use its Bay Trail chips, but it’s mobile unit had a loss of $4.2 billion last year, worse than its $3.1 billion loss in 2013. Intel believes the new Sofia chips are ideal for the fast-growing, low-end smartphone market in Asia and has said it does not plan to use costly subsidies to sell the chips this year. The Sofia chips currently shipping have 3G features for low-end phones, and 4G versions for pricier smartphones will be released later this year, the company added. "

2013-09-10,5,"The new line of chips, called Intel Quark, will ship next year and include an ingestible version aimed at biomedical uses, Intel’s president, Renee James, told reporters late on Monday. The Quark chips will be five times smaller and 10 times more power efficient than some of Intel’s Atom chips for tablets and smartphones, she said. “We’re very committed to not missing the next big thing,” James said. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, dominates the PC industry, but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich and James spoke on Tuesday at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, their first major public appearance since their promotion in May, when Paul Otellini stepped aside as chief executive. Intel’s focus on wearable computing -- a trend that for many Americans evokes images of Dick Tracy, the comic strip detective who sported a two-way wrist radio -- comes as Silicon Valley eyes sophisticated computerized watches with touch-screens and other high-tech features. Technology companies see wearables as a growth opportunity amid signs that explosive expansion in smartphones shipments since Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007 is receding. Last week, Samsung Electronics launched the Galaxy Gear watch, and Qualcomm, an Intel rival, launched the Toq smartwatch in a bid to showcase its technology to potential manufacturers. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran seen as the company’s manufacturing guru, has said that under his leadership Intel will give much more priority to its Atom line of mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. Processors based on technology from ARM and made by Qualcomm and Samsung account for most of the mobile market. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. The company has promised major performance improvements in its new Bay Trail chip for tablets. The Bay Trail chip is based on Intel’s new Silvermont architecture, which is the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption."
2015-06-09,2,"Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture capital arm, said it would allocate $125 million over the next few years to bring more management diversity to its start-up portfolio. Some of that sum will overlap with the previously announced $300 million, Intel said. The move comes as technology companies face heavy criticism for their overwhelmingly male and white workforces, which some argue creates a climate that discourages women and minorities from aspiring to work in technology or sticking around if they start there. Increased diversity would lead to stronger, more innovative companies, the thinking goes. The fund, spearheaded by Lisa Lambert, an African-American and a managing director at Intel Capital, is leading by example. She and her team have already spent $16.7 million on an initial four investments, including one company led by a woman. Brit Morin’s Brit & Co, an online San Francisco-based retailer sells do-it-yourself kits and tutorials. Like all the companies backed by the fund, Brit & Co fits into Intel’s broader strategy, in this case, advancing technologies such as Intel’s Galileo development board. Brit & Co is promoting the board, essentially a circuit board with an Intel chip, as a tool its “maker” community can use on projects. “We’re not doing this purely because they represent diverse teams,” Lambert said about the companies in an interview. “They’re integral to Intel’s core investments.” By funneling some diversity money through venture capital, Intel reasons it can nurture a group of role models that in turn will encourage more minorities and women to aspire to work in technology startups. That will benefit both Intel and the broader economy. The fund also led an investment in CareCloud, a Miami-based healthcare provider where the diversity quotient is less obvious given the sea of white male faces that appear on the management section of the company’s website. But women and Hispanics comprise more than half CareCloud’s workforce, Lambert said, including founder and chief strategy officer Albert Santalo. Rounding out the group are Mark One, a San Francisco-based company peddling cups that use Intel technology to automatically evaluate the calories and nutritional content of beverages poured into them, and Venafi, a Salt Lake City-based cybersecurity company. Three African-Americans sit on the executive staff of Mark One, Lambert said, while three senior women, including the chief information officer, serve at Venafi. Intel’s U.S. workforce comprises 51,118 employees, of which 24 percent are women, 31 percent are Asian, 8 percent are Hispanic or Latino, and 4 percent are African American.

2013-09-04,0,"The Santa Clara, California, company said on Wednesday the new Atom chips, which are meant for microservers, networking equipment and storage at major cloud-computing providers, perform six times better than previous versions. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry as well as servers but the company has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets. Most of those devices use low-power chips made by Qualcomm Inc and other companies using technology licensed from ARM Holdings. Advanced Micro Devices Inc and other companies now plan to use ARM’s technology to make low-power microserver chips for data centers, a market Intel is determined to defend. Intel’s new chips are made with the company’s 22-nanometer manufacturing technology, which is at least a year ahead of rivals. The chips are based on a new microarchitecture called Silvermont. “Data centers have always been a high-margin business. Microservers are a beachhead, and Intel is trying to kill the attacking army,” said Gartner analyst Sergis Mushell. In May, Intel announced Silvermont, the first overhaul of the Atom chip line since it was introduced for notebooks in 2008 and eventually expanded to include versions for mobile gadgets, data centers and car entertainment systems. The new Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used in a range of car models with different features. Silvermont is also the basis for Intel’s new 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips, shipping this month, and upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips."
2015-01-29,0,"Intel’s “vPro” processors account for a fifth of the chipmaker’s corporate PC business and that proportion is growing, Tom Garrison, Intel’s vice president and general manager of business client platforms, recently told Reuters. With a recovery in the PC industry driven in part by consumers buying cheap, low-end laptops, corporations buying top-tier devices for their workers are an important sweet spot for Intel and manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Shipments of Intel’s vPro processors, which are more profitable for the Santa Clara, California, company than many of its other PC chips, are increasing compared with overall demand for desktop and laptop computers, he said. “We’re growing at double digits from 2014 over 2013,” Garrison said. “There are 100 million vPros installed in businesses today.” Earlier in January, Intel said it expects the overall PC market to be about flat this year and for average prices to decline slightly. In its newest vPro offering, based on the company’s recently launched 5th generation Core chips and announced on Thursday, Intel is touting features aimed at eliminating time wasted at the start of conference-room meetings. vPro computers can use wifi to connect directly to overhead projectors and other large screens without having to fiddle with cables. The new chips use the similar technology to eliminate the need for docking stations used at office workstations to connect laptops to monitors and keyboards. vPro chips are used for laptops, desktops and convertible devices. Similar features are already available for consumer devices but the versions used on vPro chips offer better security and reliability, Garrison said.

2015-06-02,-3,"By Lehar Maan and Bill Rigby BANGALORE/SEATTLE, June 1 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  $17 billion purchase of programmable chip maker Altera Corp  is a costly defensive move to ward off rivals in the prized datacenter business it dominates, analysts said on Monday. Intel’s biggest acquisition ever will let the Santa Clara, California company offer twice the computing power when its Xeon processors used in servers are combined with Altera’s programmable chips. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits. “This whole deal is defensive for the datacenter,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who saw it as an admission by Intel that it was getting harder to drive performance gains. He questioned Intel’s projections for the programmable chip market, which is built on datacenter use and growing adoption of Intel chips in everyday objects connected to the Internet. “I think their growth goals are ludicrous,” he said. “They think it’s going to grow 7 percent a year, but Altera shrunk 2 percent a year in the last three years.” Still, big data companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft are all tweaking their servers to get their datacenters to run faster and more efficiently. Microsoft has tried using programmable chips combined with Intel’s Xeon processors. Altera’s chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), can be configured as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “You can put your software down into the silicon,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich told CNBC in an interview. Intel, which analysts estimate has more than 90 percent of the datacenter market, already has an agreement to use Altera chips. Its move comes as companies such as Qualcomm  Inc, using ARM Holdings -designed chips and the soon-to-be merged Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corp , also target the datacenter market. By buying Altera, Intel avoids the risk of being dropped as the smaller company’s manufacturing partner, which had been the subject of some speculation, said Gartner analyst Mark Hung. The purchase means Intel is hedging against the likelihood that the rise of FPGA chips will reduce the need for central processing unit (CPU) chips running servers, where Intel currently dominates. “This way Intel will profit if customers use FPGAs instead of CPUs,” said FBR Capital markets analyst Christopher Rolland. “Intel will be the only company that will be able to combine x86 server CPUs with FPGAs onto a single die. This could eventually be a $1 billion market, with the lion’s share going to Intel.”   (Reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore, Bill Rigby in Seattle, Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Diane Craft)"
2013-02-17,2,"Intel, the world’s No. 1 chipmaker, will build chips over the next two to three years with features measuring just 14 nm in Ireland and the United States but the company is already thinking about where it will produce 10 nm chips. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. Intel Israel executives said they would like to see 10 nm production in Israel. “The average life of a technology is two to six years so we need to be busy to get the next technology, 10 nanometer,” Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told a news conference on Sunday. “We need to get a decision far enough in advance to be able to upgrade the plant. So for 10 nanometer, decisions will need to be made this year.” Fassberg said upgrading the existing Fab 28 plant in Israel would require a lower investment than building a new plant but would still involve several billion dollars. Intel Israel has in the past received government grants to help with the costs of its investments and Fassberg told Reuters the company was “constantly in talks with the government”. Intel has invested $10.5 billion in Israel in the past decade, including $1.1 billion in 2012, and has received $1.3 billion in government grants. The company accounted for 20 percent of Israel’s high-tech exports last year and 10 percent of its industrial exports, excluding diamonds. “If Intel had not increased its exports, Israel’s high-tech exports would have shrunk by 10 percent,” Intel Israel President Mooly Eden said. Most of Intel Israel’s exports - $3.5 billion - came from its chip manufacturing activities. Intel is Israel’s largest private employer, with 8,542 workers, up 10 percent from 2011. The company has two plants - in Jerusalem and Kiryat Gat - as well as four research and development centers. Eden said Intel was also committed to investing in start-ups, having invested in 64 Israeli companies since 1996. In July its global investment arm Intel Capital said it would expand its operations in Israel. "
2013-06-07,-2,"CBS, News Corp and Viacom have reached agreements with Intel on certain details over how their content would be distributed on the service the chipmaker plans to begin later this year, one person familiar with the situation said. Comcast’s NBC Universal is continuing its talks with Intel but its negotiations are not as advanced others companies, said another source familiar with the matter. Intel has moved substantially on subscriber fees it is willing to pay since the negotiations began, one source said. It has also suggested preventing viewers from skipping commercials on the first run of a show, said another source. Representatives for Viacom, NBC, CBS, News Corp, Disney’s ABC and Time Warner declined to comment. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, and therefore has no viewers, it can expect to pay a premium, all the sources said. SNL Kagan, a research firm that measures and publishes the average subscriber fees cable and satellite TV operators pay for television networks, recorded last year’s highest fees were $5.15 per subscriber per month and were charged by Disney’s ESPN. While it was not clear exactly what amounts Intel had originally offered for specific channels, sources said the tech company was basing its 50 to 75 percent premium on listed average SNL Kagan subscriber fees. Intel needs deals with the top five or six U.S. media companies to secure most of the popular TV channels, according to one source. Intel said in February that it planned to compete with Apple, Amazon and Google and provide a set-top box and service that would offer live and on-demand programming. Erik Huggers, the head of Intel Media, has said he plans to offer customers smaller bundles of content than those currently being offered by cable and satellite operators. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Huggers has billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Higher prices for consumers would give Intel breathing room to pay more to media companies without sacrificing its own margins. Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said the chipmaker still plans to launch its TV service this year, but declined to give details of negotiations with media companies. Having missed the mobile revolution and fallen behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel senior executives are eager to be on the leading edge of future consumer technologies. Intel sees the living room as a potential battleground, where its advanced chips, used in set-top boxes and to power “cloud” data centers, can give it an advantage and help set the standard for other home entertainment products. "
2012-02-28,1,"Intel had invested in the JV in 2006 to spur growth in the then-emerging technology. NAND has since gained prominence as computing power shifts to smartphones and tablets. As part of the agreement, Micron, the largest U.S.-based maker of computer memory chips, will continue to supply NAND chips to Intel. “Micron is going to get as much as a 30 percent more capacity from the deal and they would now be able to sell a significant portion of this back to Intel at an incremental profit,” Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann told Reuters. Intel pays Micron almost $1 billion annually for flash memory. The deal is expected to give Micron better margins on at least half of these sales, without increasing supply. Wells Fargo analyst David Wong said in a note that it made sense for Intel to enter into the initial joint venture to drive growth of NAND supply, and it is now an appropriate time to exit given Micron’s lead in investing in the venture. Micron got about 40 percent of its revenue from DRAM chips -- used as primary memory in PCs -- in the last fiscal but oversupply has dented margins. Top DRAM maker Elpida Memory 6665.T filed for bankruptcy on Monday. Analysts expect Micron to buy some of Elpida’s NAND factories. As part of the sale, Intel will get half of the $600 million in cash while the rest will be deposited with Micron, to be refunded or adjusted against Intel’s future purchases. “It’s a great deal for Micron, they’re getting it for the cheap,” Raymond James’ Mosesmann said. According to Intel’s latest annual filing, the carrying value of its stake in the JV stood at $1.3 billion as of December 31. On Tuesday, the companies said Intel sold the stake at about their book value. “Intel might take a charge of as much as $700 million for this transaction,” Wells Fargo’s Wong said. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of this year, subject to certain conditions, the companies said. Boise, Idaho-based Micron will buy Intel’s stake in their Manassas, Virginia, and Singapore factories. The $3 billion Singapore facility, capable of making almost half of the JV’s capacity of flash memory, started production last April. The JV’s third manufacturing facility in Utah will continue to operate with minimal changes, the two companies said in a statement. Micron shares jumped 7 percent to $9.16, and were trading at $9.02 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq. The stock gained 7 percent on Monday after Elpida’s bankruptcy filing. Intel shares were up 1 percent at $27.27. "
2016-03-09,1,"Replay’s technology was used in the recent National Basketball Association All-Star Weekend, mainly giving fans a 360 degree view of the slam dunk contest. Intel worked with Replay’s technology to create a 3D video rendering of the court using 28 ultra high-definition cameras positioned around the arena and connected to Intel-based servers. It was also used in the National Football League’s Super Bowl. “Intel has been collaborating with Replay since 2013 to optimize their interactive, immersive video content on Intel platforms,” Intel said. “Technology now plays an unprecedented role in sports - and we’re just getting started.” Founded in 2011 Replay last month raised $13.5 million in funding round led by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTEGn.DE) to bring total fundraising to $27 million. Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, holds a stake in Replay. "
2014-11-20,-1,"Kicking off Intel’s annual investor day, Chairman Andy Bryant said he saw progress in Intel’s strategy of staking out a big chunk of market share in tablets this year by offering manufacturers subsidies to use its chips. “I’m not going to tell you I‘m proud of losing the kind of money we’re losing but I’m also going to tell you I’m not embarrassed by it like I was a year ago about where we were,” Bryant said. “This is the price you pay for sitting on the sidelines for a number of years and then fighting your way back into the market.” The Santa Clara, California company said it expects gross margins in 2015 to be 62 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points. Analysts on average expected 63 percent gross margins for 2015 and 2014. Capital spending next year will be about $10.5 billion, the company said, compared to about $11 billion expected in 2014. A global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s launch of the iPad four years ago has stabilized in recent months, in part due to companies replacing employees’ older laptops. Krzanich said a plan disclosed this week to merge Intel’s mobile unit with its PC group was in line with manufacturing customers that see their own product lineups of smartphones, tablets and laptops merging.   He said Intel was on track to exceed its goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year. That strategy made Intel the No 2 tablet chip supplier in the June quarter, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, but it cost the company billions of dollars in subsidies. Intel has made much less progress in chips for smartphones. Intel’s stock was up 2.9 percent at $35.34.  "
2012-07-03,-9,"The fine, which represented 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover versus a possible maximum of 10 percent, was the biggest ever levied on a company. A panel of five judges at the General Court in Luxembourg, Europe’s second highest, will hear arguments from both the EU watchdog and Intel during the four-day hearing, in which the company wants its conviction and fine thrown out or reduced. The Commission did not have sufficient evidence of any wrongdoing by Intel and relied too much on subjective comments by the company’s customers, Intel’s lawyer Nicholas Green told the court. “The quality of evidence relied on by the Commission is profoundly inadequate. The analysis is hopelessly and irretrievably defective,” he said. “The Commission’s case turns on what customers’ subjective understanding is,” Green said. U.S. No.2 PC maker Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC, world No.2 PC maker Lenovo and German retail chain Media Saturn Holding received rebates from Intel during the period investigated by the regulator. Lawyers for the Commission said this was at the core of Intel’s illegal business practice. “These kind of rebates can only be intended to tie customers and put competitors in an unfavourable position,” Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan told judges. He said contract wording also showed that “Intel carefully camouflaged its anti-competitive practices”. Intel gained backing from the European Ombudsman, who censured the Commission for procedural errors in its investigation. In his non-binding report issued five months after the regulatory finding, the Ombudsman said he had found “maladministration” because the regulator had failed to make a proper note of a meeting with Dell during its probe. The Association for Competitive Technology, a lobby group representing more than 3,000 small software developers and information technology firms, supported Intel. French consumer organisation Que choisir is backing the Commission’s position. The General Court is expected to rule in the coming months. Companies can appeal to the highest court, the EU Court of Justice, if they take their case further. The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission. "
2013-08-23,-1,"Setting up shop in Los Angeles’ Santa Monica and New York’s Nolita brings Intel closer to the major TV networks and production studios that the world’s biggest chipmaker must strike deals with to gather content for its live and on-demand service, Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said. Opening the offices is a sign that Intel is committed to moving ahead with the venture even though progress making deals has been slow. Some industry insiders have expressed doubts about Intel’s ability to successfully create a business to challenge traditional cable operators. “It suggests that there’s an ongoing level of interest, maybe an incremental positive to their commitment,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “They have to continue down this path or there’s no hope of being successful.” Intel plans to introduce the TV service, to be delivered through the Internet and a set-top box, this year in a phased rollout in regional markets, Carvill said. In July, Intel Media hired Moe Khosravy, a cloud-computing expert who previously worked at Microsoft Corp and VMWare Inc, as head of software and user experiences. Intel has about 375 people working on the TV business, most of them based at Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing. Some content providers have agreed with Intel about how their content would be distributed, but as of June the chipmaker had yet to sign any deals despite offering to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Carvill declined to comment on Intel’s negotiations. Intel is not the only technology company trying to revolutionize the TV industry, where Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc and DirecTV are players and have much to lose from potential new entrants. Apple Inc , Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc are believed to be working on their own new TV services and products. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, it can expect to pay a premium. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Intel Media head Erik Huggers has billed it as a premium product, with small bundles of channels and an attractive user interface rather than as a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions."
2014-03-31,1,"The chipmaker’s investment values the startup, expected to go public later this year, at about $4.1 billion. In the release, Cloudera announced the completion of a $900 million round of funding, which it said includes Intel’s previously undisclosed stake and another $160 million that was announced earlier in March from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and others. Intel said last Thursday it had made a “significant” investment in Cloudera and that it would make the fast-growing startup its preferred distributor of “Hadoop” data management software. Like rivals HortonWorks and Pivotal, Cloudera focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through Hadoop, an open-source software system that can sort and analyze massive amounts of information, increasingly called Big Data, generated through the Internet and mobile devices. As part of the deal, Intel will transition away from its own customized version of Hadoop that it had been promoting as optimal for Intel server chips. The size of Intel’s investment in Cloudera and the end of its own Hadoop customization underscores a willingness by CEO Brian Krzanich to move decisively since taking over a year ago with the personal computer industry in a tailspin. Cloudera is only one of several Silicon Valley startups to receive multibillion-dollar valuations from investors recently, a trend that has some on Wall Street concerned about lofty prices. Last week, Facebook Inc raised eyebrows when it said it would pay $2 billion for Oculus VR, a two-year-old virtual reality startup that has yet to put a product on the market. Intel hopes that encouraging more companies to leap into Big Data analysis will lead to higher sales of its high-end Xeon server processors. The chipmaker believes that hitching its wagon to Cloudera’s version of Hadoop, instead of pushing its own version, will make that happen faster. With Intel’s core PC market shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming a larger component of the company’s profits. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Big Data is a key part of the Internet of Things, a term referring to the increasing connectivity of everyday devices from cars to smoke alarms. Finding ways to analyze and make use of vast amounts of data collected by those smart devices is becoming a major opportunity for IT companies including Intel. The global market for Big Data technology and services is expected to expand at a 27 percent annual rate to $32 billion through 2017, according to market research firm IDC. After falling behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel aims to make sure it is a major player in the Internet of Things by supplying processors used in new devices as well as the server hardware and software used to analyze the data those devices create. Intel’s bet on the success of Cloudera dwarfs its previous investments focused on data center technology. In 2007, Intel invested $218 million in VMWare, giving it a 2.5 percent stake in that data center software maker.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
2013-03-07,0,"Such a move may also offer a backdoor of sorts into large-scale production of chips for mobile devices, where Intel has made little headway after underestimating the impact of the iPhone and iPad and falling behind more nimble rivals. Intel said last week it will open up its prized manufacturing technology to make chips designed by fellow chipmaker Altera -- snagging its first sizeable customer in a contract manufacturing, or “foundry”, business expected to grow. That has spurred talk of an Apple deal. A source close to one of the companies says Intel and Apple executives have discussed the issue in the past year but no agreement has been reached. “If you can have a strategic relationship where you’re making chips for one of the largest mobile players, you should definitely consider that. And for Apple, that gets them a big advantage.” said Pat Becker Jr, of Becker Capital Management, which owned about $39 million worth of Intel shares at the end of last year. Intel’s plan entails heavy capital spending, even as it struggles in its core market and has yet to find enough new demand to fill future fabrication plants. It would also mean getting into a foundry sector that, because it depends on volume to drive business, is highly vulnerable to economic swings and could compress Intel’s industry-leading margins. But it is a bet that analysts say is necessary if Intel wants to remain a top player. The company believes that taking on more contract manufacturing business will not only help fill an upcoming generation of production lines, but help pay for the cost of research to upgrade them. After Intel upped its capital spending budget by $2 billion to $13 billion this year, speculation grew that Apple could ink a deal to use Intel’s leading process technology to make better chips for its iPad and iPhone. Doing so could help Apple end its foundry relationship with Samsung, which has become a fierce competitor with its own smartphones and tablets. Sunit Rikhi, vice president and general manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters last week his group is ready to take on a potential large, unidentified mobile customer, although he declined to discuss Apple specifically. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the chipmaker is in constant discussions with Apple, which buys its PC chips, but he would not comment on negotiations about a potential foundry relationship. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. While Otellini has said he expects to be replaced by an Intel insider, the board of directors has recently increased its focus on potential outside candidates, according to two sources. Whomever the board chooses must face fundamental decisions about Intel’s still-small contract manufacturing business, like how much and how quickly to expand and whether it should supply to Apple, which designs its mobile chips using technology Intel competes with. “This is potentially huge,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “The new CEO will have a very large opportunity to take this to the next level. Those discussions about taking on Apple as a foundry customer are going to be very complex and very contentious.” Intel’s chip-manufacturing technology is at least two years ahead of Taiwanese foundry TSMC’s or Samsung‘s. But critics say Intel’s “x86” chip architecture is better suited to PCs and servers than to mobile gadgets, which prize low power-consumption and portability. Making Apple’s chips however would come at a price for Intel. Such a move could be seen as a capitulation of Intel’s own smartphone and tablet chip designs, which are gradually becoming more efficient but have yet to be accepted for use in any major devices. Complicating a possible deal is that the iPhone maker designs its mobile chips with technology licensed from ARM Holdings. ARM’s architecture competes against Intel’s and is ubiquitous in mobile gadgets, where Intel’s own technology has not caught on. Santa Clara, California-based Intel has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. Intel’s gross margins are expected to be about 60 percent this year, down from 62 percent in 2012 but still more attractive than TSMC’s gross margins of around 48 percent. “They have a business-model question they have to answer. That’s something the new CEO will have to wrestle with,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets that require much less intensive computing. Its market share for smartphones stands at less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm, Samsung and others. Concerns on Wall Street about slowing PC sales and Intel’s lack of progress in mobile have pushed the chipmaker’s shares down about 19 percent over the past year. In Intel’s favor is the fact that the sheer amount of investment involved in new generations of semiconductor manufacturing technology has led most chipmakers in recent decades to give up running their own capital-intensive fabrication plants, turning instead to foundries like TSMC. Intel’s agreement with Altera followed deals with minor chipmakers to use Intel’s fabs. Otellini in December said “a lot of stuff” was in the pipeline. Shifting production of iPhone and iPad chips to Intel could lead to an additional $4.2 billion in revenue in 2015, with a gross margin of around 50 percent, according to Macquarie analyst Shawn Webster. “They’ve got to have a foundry component to the business, just so they can get the best return on investment for all that capital they’re spending,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “The next CEO is the guy or gal who’s going to execute that strategy.” "
2013-09-10,6,"The new line of chips, called Intel Quark, will ship next year and include an ingestible version aimed at biomedical uses, Intel’s president, Renee James, told reporters late on Monday. The Quark chips will be five times smaller and 10 times more power efficient than Intel’s Atom chips for tablets and smartphones, she said. “We’re very committed to not missing the next big thing,” James said. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich and James spoke on Tuesday at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, their first major public appearance since their promotion in May, when Paul Otellini stepped aside as chief executive. Krzanich said tablets made with Intel chips and priced at less than $100 would be on store shelves in time for this year’s holiday season. He was flanked by rows of Android and Windows 8 tablets, many of them with attachable keyboards - an effort by Intel to show conference attendees it has made progress in mobile. Intel said the first chips made on its cutting-edge 14 nanometer technology would start production late this year and be available in 2014, helping it extend its competitive lead in manufacturing. Intel’s most advanced chips are currently made with 22 nanometer production technology, which is already more advanced than production lines at Intel rivals like Samsung and TSMC. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry, but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Technology companies see wearables as a growth opportunity amid signs that explosive expansion in smartphones shipments since Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007 is receding. Last week, Samsung Electronics launched the Galaxy Gear watch, and Qualcomm, an Intel rival, launched the Toq smartwatch in a bid to showcase its technology to potential manufacturers. Krzanich showed off a prototype watch and clunky bracelet made with the Quark chips. ”The idea is not to bring these to market but to come up with devices that our partners can use to develop their own products in this open ecosystem, he said. A three-decade Intel veteran seen as the company’s manufacturing guru, Krzanich has said that under his leadership Intel will give much more priority to its Atom line of mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. Processors based on technology from ARM and made by Qualcomm and Samsung account for most of the mobile market. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. The company has promised major performance improvements in its new Bay Trail chip for tablets. The Bay Trail chip is based on Intel’s new Silvermont architecture, which is the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption. Also on Tuesday, Intel launched a new line of its brawny Xeon chips for servers, a market it almost completely dominates. The new server chips have up to 50 percent better performance than previous versions and 45 percent more energy efficiency, Intel said. Intel recently began shipping a low-power line of data center chips based on the Silvermont architecture, part of its strategy to defend its territory from smaller chipmakers hoping to use ARM technology widely used in smartphones to push into the servers.

2012-02-09,-25,"* Judge had narrowed state’s case in December * No admission of wrongdoing * Intel still appealing European regulatory fine By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel Feb 9 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to pay just $6.5 million to resolve an antitrust lawsuit in which New York’s attorney general accused the world’s largest chipmaker of threatening computer makers and paying billions of dollars of kickbacks to maintain its market dominance. The settlement ends a November 2009 Delaware case brought by Andrew Cuomo, then New York’s attorney general and now governor. Eric Schneiderman, the current attorney general, took over the case when he succeeded Cuomo in that position. Intel’s $6.5 million payment represents less than five hours of profit for the Santa Clara, California-based company, based on reported net income of $12.94 billion for 2011. Cuomo had accused Intel of violating state and federal antitrust law through a “systematic worldwide campaign” to bully customers into buying its personal computer chips, at the expense of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But the lawsuit lost much of its punch when U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark said the state could not seek triple damages, and was allowed to pursue claims over just three years of computer purchases, not four or six as it had sought. Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said the state’s lawyers still believe their substantive claims have merit, but that “in light of the court’s decision believe that no purpose is served by pursuing the matter further.” Intel said it was pleased to settle, and that the accord did not require it to admit to any allegations or violation of law, or make any changes to its business. “We have always said that Intel’s business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” General Counsel Doug Melamed said in a statement. Cuomo had contended that Intel bribed or coerced computer makers such as Dell Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and International Business Machines Corp, and threatened retaliation. Emails showed that top Intel officers including Chief Executive Paul Otellini were aware of some of the improper activity, Cuomo alleged. Intel has long faced allegations of anticompetitive conduct, and is still appealing a 1.06 billion euro (now US$1.41 billion) fine imposed in 2009 by European regulators. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a case in which it accused Intel of unlawfully stifling competition in microprocessors. The same year, a different Delaware federal judge approved a settlement with shareholders that called for Intel to make more than 40 corporate governance changes, including the creation of a compliance committee to monitor antitrust litigation. And in November 2009, barely a week after Cuomo sued, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25 billion to settle all outstanding legal disputes with its smaller rival. Intel is incorporated in Delaware. The case is New York v. Intel Corp, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 09-00827."
2014-08-29,7,"Faintuch, who previously oversaw Qualcomm’s networking and connectivity businesses as president of Qualcomm Atheros, is joining Intel as a senior vice president and co-general manager of the Platform Engineering Group, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said on Friday.  He will be among Intel’s dozen or so most senior executives and will co-manage the Platform Engineering Group with Josh Walden, a manufacturing technology expert who previously led the group. Mulloy told Reuters that in addition to strong network skills, Faintuch brings experience designing “system on chips,” or SoCs, which combine features like modems, Wi-Fi and memory.  While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing SoCs, which are widely used in smartphones and tablets. “We want to accelerate our success rate with SoCs and get the designs aligned and the roadmaps aligned to do that,” Mulloy said. “We’ve made good progress but there’s more to be done. Amir has extensive management experience and a strong resume.” A Qualcomm spokesman had no comment beyond confirming Faintuch’s departure. Bringing in Faintuch, which was announced in an email to Intel employees on Friday, is the latest move by the company to accelerate progress in mobile gadgets, where it trails Qualcomm. Since taking over in 2013, CEO Brian Krzanich has made a number of sweeping changes designed to counteract a slump in PC sales, including opening Intel’s cutting-edge factories to other chipmakers willing to pay for access to them. In May, Intel reached an agreement with Chinese SoC specialist Rockchip to make chips for inexpensive tablets running Google Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Android platform. As Intel struggles with declining PC sales and slow progress in mobile, Qualcomm, whose smartphone chips lead the industry, has been viewed by many engineers in recent years as a potentially more attractive place to work.  In 2012, senior executive Anand Chandrasekher, a 25-year Intel veteran, jumped over to Qualcomm to become the San Diego company’s chief marketing officer. "
2014-06-12,0,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, June 12 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp  on Thursday raised its outlook for the second quarter and the full year, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers used by businesses. Shares of Intel jumped more than 4 percent in extended trade as the chipmaker’s improved forecast lifted hopes for a PC industry that been shrinking due to consumers’ preferences for tablets and smartphones. Intel said it now expects second-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Intel had previously forecast revenue of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The chipmaker said it expects “some” revenue growth for the full year, compared with its previous forecast of flat revenue. The Santa Clara, California company also raised the mid-point of its gross margin forecast range for the second quarter, which ends at the end of June, by 1 point to 64 percent. With personal computer shipments falling for eight straight quarters through March, some analysts have suggested the industry’s decline is close to hitting bottom, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile and wearable devices. Demand from companies for PCs likely received a boost recently due to Microsoft’s winding down of support in April for its Windows XP operating system, analysts say. “PCs have been getting less bad for a while,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But if it’s all business PCs then the question is going to be sustainability.” Intel’s revised revenue and gross margin forecasts for the June quarter could translate to earnings per share of 52 cents, RBC analyst Doug Freedman said in a note to clients. For the second quarter, analysts on average had expected EPS of 47 cents and revenue of $13.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel is expected to report its second-quarter results on July 15. Shares of Intel jumped 4.97 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.11 percent at $27.96 on Nasdaq.

2016-04-21,1,"While revenue for its flagship cloud services business Azure more than doubled last quarter, the company said in Thursday’s earning report, the “intelligent cloud” division that includes it saw just 3 percent revenue growth in the period. And operating profits for the division dropped by 14 percent, in part reflecting non-cloud products included under its umbrella, such as traditional server software.       Chipmaker Intel has a less clear path to growth for its cloud operations, and investors have remained skeptical.   The company’s  share price is down about 1 percent over the last year, as software maker Microsoft’s stock rose about 30 percent. Microsoft’s market capitalization of around $440 billion is almost three times Intel’s at $151 billion, compared to about double five years ago. “Wintel” computers running Windows on Intel chips dominated the personal-computing era, which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops. Both Intel and Microsoft, run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella, are betting their businesses on the cloud. Graphic on Intel and Microsoft market value: here     At Intel, in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as it shifts away from the PC, data-center business revenue rose 9 percent to $4 billion. That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers, where the company says it is doing well. “There’s this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this (cloud) trend,” said Dan Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio. “Intel is still more drowned out,” meaning not as high-profile.  Microsoft’s best-known play in the cloud is Azure, a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers.  Azure is gaining ground on Amazon’s AWS unit, the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services. Azure commands about 10 percent of the $23 billion market, estimates Synergy Research, compared with AWS’ 31 percent.  Much of the difference in the companies’ fortunes boils down to Microsoft’s fundamental business as a software company versus Intel’s as a hardware company, said Nick Sturiale, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners.  Clients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel’s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group.  “The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,” said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest. Intel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips. In a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel’s “top to bottom” understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead.  “Always paranoid about the competition, always driving,” he said.  “And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.”	  Intel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off.   And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come.  Much of its “intelligent cloud” business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment’s name “is to align to the ambition” of  building the cloud. Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term “cloud” came up 59 times. In Intel’s call this week, it came up 11 times. "
2013-11-25,-3,"Intel declined to comment on the report. Intel’s project, called OnCue, has faced challenges getting off the ground since it was officially launched in February. The chipmaker’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided Intel could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters last week. While Intel came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say.

2014-07-16,0,"At least 19 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock to $29-$45, while two brokerages raised their ratings to an equivalent of “buy”. The broker actions came after Intel forecast on Tuesday third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters that PC sales had stabilized, easing fears about the four-year decline in computer sales as consumers turn increasingly to tablets and smartphones. Intel also raised its share buyback program by $20 billion. “The company is showing clear growth in its PC segment and acceleration in data center growth, suggesting, we think, better growth potential in Intel’s end markets than many investors expect,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso, however, said it would be tough to sustain the near-term strength in PC and data center demand. He maintained his “neutral” rating on the stock. Of the 46 analysts covering Intel, 18 have a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock, while 23 have a “hold” or equivalent rating. Intel’s shares were up 6.5 percent at $33.78 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The stock has gained more than 32 percent in the 12 months to Tuesday’s close.

2012-09-07,-20,"* Cuts 3rd-qtr revenue view to $13.2 billion * Shares down 3.4 pct * Pulls back capital spending By Noel Randewich and Nicola Leske SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp cut its third-quarter revenue estimate more than expected on Friday due to a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer personal computers. Intel also said it was scaling back capital spending as a result of the business slowdown. Intel’s stock fell 3.6 percent, and shares of ASML  and other companies that make chip-manufacturing equipment also lost ground. A revision of Intel targets had been anticipated by some analysts after PC makers Hewlett Packard and Dell Inc  warned of slow demand last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the 8 percent reduction in the top chipmaker’s revenue outlook was much more severe than expected. Intel also withdrew its full-year forecast. The scaled-back outlook comes just days ahead of a major event where Intel will tout a new generation of processors that consume less power, central to its strategy of reinvigorating a stagnant PC industry. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the size of the Intel cut was surprising and was a worrying new sign that the company is seeing weakness in PC sales to businesses and governments, known as enterprise sales. “They also have weakness in enterprise PCs in emerging markets. In the last six to eight quarters, consumers have been weak but the enterprise was strong. Now the enterprise is weak,” Rasgon said. Intel has been banking on the Windows 8 release in October to help slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. While a major Windows release normally boosts computer sales, analysts believe it might not help as much this time. At the forum, Intel is expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Along with concerns about consumer demand being hurt by the weak economy, manufacturers are reluctant to commit their resources until they have a better idea of which kinds of new devices will become hits with consumers. “You’re trying to decide are people going to buy ... a tablet that slots into a keyboard, or are they going buy traditional notebooks or ultrabooks,” MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum said. “In the absence of knowing what to sell, there’s a clear reluctance to build any sort of further inventory.” Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel. Intel said it now expects third-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from its previous forecast of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $14.2 billion. The company is due to report its third-quarter results in October. Intel processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and others in the PC industry have been hit by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. Intel lowered its full-year revenue forecast in July, saying consumer spending in Europe and the United States had been weaker than it expected. The company on Friday said full-year capital spending is expected to fall short of its previous forecast of $12.1 billion to $12.9 billion. It expects gross margin of 62 percent for the third quarter, plus or minus one percentage point, down from its previous expectation of 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel shares were down 3.6 percent to $24.18 in midday trading. AMD was off 4.6 percent at $3.49.

2012-07-03,-15,"* Lawyers say regulator’s evidence “profoundly inadequate” * EU says Intel “carefully camouflaged anti-competitive practices” * Judges set to rule in coming months By Foo Yun Chee LUXEMBOURG, July 3 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators relied on “profoundly inadequate” evidence in their case against Intel, the U.S. chipmaker said in court on Tuesday in a bid to quash a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.33 billion) fine. The European Commission penalised the world’s No.1 chipmaker three years ago for hindering arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices , after an eight-year investigation. The fine, which represented 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover versus a possible maximum of 10 percent, was the biggest ever levied on a company. A panel of five judges at the General Court in Luxembourg, Europe’s second highest, will hear arguments from both the EU watchdog and Intel during the four-day hearing, in which the company wants its conviction and fine thrown out or reduced. The Commission did not have sufficient evidence of any wrongdoing by Intel and relied too much on subjective comments by the company’s customers, Intel’s lawyer Nicholas Green told the court. “The quality of evidence relied on by the Commission is profoundly inadequate. The analysis is hopelessly and irretrievably defective,” he said. “The Commission’s case turns on what customers’ subjective understanding is,” Green said. U.S. No.2 PC maker Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co , Japan’s NEC, world No.2 PC maker Lenovo  and German retail chain Media Saturn Holding received rebates from Intel during the period investigated by the regulator. Lawyers for the Commission said this was at the core of Intel’s illegal business practice. “These kind of rebates can only be intended to tie customers and put competitors in an unfavourable position,” Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan told judges. He said contract wording also showed that “Intel carefully camouflaged its anti-competitive practices”. Intel gained backing from the European Ombudsman, who censured the Commission for procedural errors in its investigation. In his non-binding report issued five months after the regulatory finding, the Ombudsman said he had found “maladministration” because the regulator had failed to make a proper note of a meeting with Dell during its probe. The Association for Competitive Technology, a lobby group representing more than 3,000 small software developers and information technology firms, supported Intel. French consumer organisation Que choisir is backing the Commission’s position. The General Court is expected to rule in the coming months. Companies can appeal to the highest court, the EU Court of Justice, if they take their case further. The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission. "

2013-11-06,-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has set up a business division aimed at making money out of a new technology wave that can link up a host of electronic devices. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker and other technology companies are betting that what they call the ‘Internet of Things’ - a trend toward connecting everything from bathroom scales to skyscraper ventilation systems via the Internet - will create massive demand for new electronics and software. As Intel strives to make sure it’s not caught off-guard by future technology trends, its new ‘Internet of Things Solutions Group’ will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, according to Doug Davis, the group’s general manager. “Krzanich is saying, ‘I want a higher level of focus on this to help us grow it and put the level of attention on it that it deserves,'” Davis told Reuters on Tuesday. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the personal computer industry but was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. A three-decade Intel manufacturing veteran who took over as CEO in May, Krzanich has made developing mobile chips a higher priority within Intel. In September, Krzanich announced that Intel was working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, along with an ingestible version for biomedical uses. The new solutions group combines an existing Intel business focused on chips for commercial and industrial devices with Intel’s Wind River subsidiary, which sells software for commercial and industrial devices. “We’re pulling together a couple of pieces that are already doing well and we want to accelerate those efforts. This creates a primary focus around ‘Internet of Things,'” Davis said."
2014-05-14,-6,"In recent weeks, close to 40 marketing employees have accepted voluntary incentive packages to leave, said two people close to the company who were not authorized to comment. Marketing vice presidents Kevin Sellers and Nancy Bhagat, who would have reported to Fund, are also leaving the chipmaker, the two sources said. The reductions come as the world’s largest chipmaker struggles to revitalize a brand associated with a crumbling PC market. CEO Brian Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion in February that Intel needed to revamp its marketing to get back some of its “coolness.” Morale among many on the marketing team is at an “all-time low” and contributed to some employees’ decisions to leave, one of the sources told Reuters. The chipmaker’s marketing department has struggled over the past year or two to captivate consumers with new ultrathin laptops and two-in-one tablets. “We all know there’s a problem. If you look at the Interbrand numbers you can see it,” said a third person familiar with Intel’s marketing department. “It was smart to go external, bring in someone with fresh thinking.” Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined to confirm how many people had left, but he said they fall within a previously announced plan to trim the chipmaker’s workforce by 5 percent this year. But he said they were not leaving as a reaction to specific problems in the marketing department. Intel’s marketing department had more than 300 employees spread around different business units and offices prior to the cuts, one of the sources estimated. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. But Intel’s brand has lost a little of its glitter in recent years. In 2013, Intel was No. 9 on consulting firm Interbrand’s global ranking, down from No. 7 in 2011. Marketing employees have been split over Krzanich’s decision to hire a new marketing chief from outside the company, unusual for the culturally insular chipmaker.

He said the Atom chips became available this quarter and offer features useful in industrial machines, like error correction and the ability to withstand high temperatures. A smaller, scaled down chip, part of Intel’s recently announced Quark line of very low-power components, is due to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2014. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. The Santa Clara, California company is now scrambling to tap into new markets to help it keep its multi-billion dollar fabrication plants humming near full capacity and protect its enviable 63-percent gross margins. Steenman declined to say when he expects chips aimed at the Internet of Things to deliver meaningful sales for Intel, which had revenue of $53 billion last year. He also declined to say how much Intel would charge for the chips. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, estimated that the Atom chips likely sell for between $20 and $50 each, while the Quark chips may be priced near $5 a piece. By comparison, Intel’s powerful, and highly profitable, Xeon chips for servers typically sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each. "

The Santa Clara, California-based company for decades has called the shots in the personal computer industry, but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics, which have been using chip architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Early last month, Intel unveiled the most extensive overhaul to date of its Atom mobile processors that underpin its push into smartphones and tablets. Intel is also betting on other developments in the industry and its Intel Capital unit announced on Tuesday a $100 million fund to invest in gesture-control and “perceptual” computing companies. “I‘m very bullish on perceptual computing. Not just touch and voice, as you get things like 3D camera solutions...how you can interact with technology, how a child can interact with a book on a computer and on 3D gesture driven mode. I think it’s going to be popular in time,” he said. Intel also unveiled its fourth generation processor on Tuesday, which is built to be used in 2-in-1 designs like those used for convertible computers that can go from a notebook to a tablet. Intel says the new processor, based on its flagship 22-nanometer Haswell microarchitecture, can provide a 50 percent improvement in battery life and provide twice the graphics capability. Intel said in April its current-quarter revenue would decline as much as 8 percent and it trimmed its 2013 capital spending plans as personal computer sales drop due to the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.

2014-01-17,-16,"* Job reductions to include attrition, other options By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp plans to reduce its global workforce of 107,000 by about 5 percent this year as the chipmaker, struggling with falling personal-computer sales, shifts focus to faster-growing areas, a company spokesman said on Friday. The announcement, equivalent to over 5,000 positions, comes a day after Intel posted a fourth-quarter earnings report that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. “This is part of aligning our human resources to meet business needs,” spokesman Chris Kraeuter said. The job reductions may include retirements, voluntary programs and other options, Kraeuter said, adding that Intel’s typical annual attrition worldwide is about 4 percent. He declined to say whether details of the changes had been announced internally. On a conference call with analysts on Thursday after the earnings release, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith alluded to a reduction in employment this year and said that Intel would increase investments in areas such as data center technology, low-power chips and tablets. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. “If they’ve got a bunch or resources in a market that may not be dead but is not growing a ton, it probably makes sense to reprioritize those investments in areas where there are fast-growing markets,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Intel has both added and shed significant numbers of jobs over the past decade. Struggling to fend off a challenge by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in 2006, Intel announced it would reduce its workforce by over 10,000 positions, but its overall number of employees has grown since then. The chipmaker is also not the only tech company to trim its workforce because of slowing demand for PCs since Apple’s  iPad started to cut into demand for laptops in 2010. Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a years-long internal restructuring that would ultimately see it shed 34,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce, through fiscal 2014. Dell succeeded last year in taking itself off public markets, allowing CEO and founder Michael Dell to restructure away from Wall Street’s scrutiny. That overhaul is expected to encompass layoffs. Earlier this week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. In its report on Thursday, Intel forecast March-quarter restructuring charges of $200 million, a portion of which could be earmarked for severance pay. Last September, Intel said it would close an old factory in Massachusetts, eliminating about 700 jobs. Intel has said it plans to quadruple tablet chip volume this year to 40 million units and aggressively stake out market share ahead of future mobile chip launches. Essentially buying its way into tablets, Intel plans to subsidize its customers’ engineering and manufacturing expenses, effectively reducing its gross margins in 2014 by 1.5 percentage points. Shares of Intel closed 2.6 percent lower at $25.85 on the Nasdaq on Friday. They earlier traded down as low as $25.25."
2013-05-06,2,"“We have not only reduced the power in a significant manner but it comes with significant performance,” Perlmutter said. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry but the company has struggled to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm. The Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used a range of car models with different features, Perlmutter said. He said it offers up to three times more computing performance than current chips and as much as five times lower power consumption. Qualcomm and other mobile chipmakers design their processors using power-efficient technology licensed from Intel-rival ARM Holdings. Intel introduced its Atom mobile processors for netbooks in 2008 and they have so far failed to be widely adopted in smartphones and tablets despite improvements made to them. Silvermont will be the basis for Intel’s 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips due out later this year and Intel says it will more than double the performance of its current tablet chips. It will also be used in Intel’s upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips and Avoton chips for microservers. While Silvermont improves the performance of Intel’s processors, the Santa Clara, California company faces other major challenges in mobile. It has fallen behind in launching chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line. "
2015-07-16,-7,"But analysts looked past the short-term benefits for the world’s largest chipmaker. “(The delay) will force investors to question INTC’s (Intel‘s) hitherto unassailable manufacturing dominance,” Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a note. Intel has now twice delayed the launch of 10 nm technology and its smaller and faster chips. The technology had been set for launch this year. “The other foundries have thus far maintained aggressive plans for future process nodes and INTC will likely face serious questions if these schedules aren’t pushed,” Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a note. Rivals, TSMC and Samsung Electronics plan to launch their 10 nm chip nodes in late 2016 and early 2017, respectively. At least two brokerages raised their ratings on Intel. The median price target is $35. "
2012-09-07,-14,"A revision of Intel targets had been expected by some analysts after PC makers Hewlett Packard Co and Dell Inc warned of slow demand last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the 8 percent reduction in the top chipmaker’s revenue outlook was much more severe than expected. Intel also withdrew its full-year forecast. The scaled-back outlook comes just days ahead of a major event where Intel will tout a new generation of processors that consume less power, central to its strategy of reinvigorating a stagnant PC industry. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the size of the Intel cut was surprising. Weakness in PC sales to businesses and governments, known as enterprise sales, cited by Intel also raised concerns. “In the last six to eight quarters, consumers have been weak but the enterprise was strong. Now the enterprise is weak,” Rasgon said. Intel has been banking on the Windows 8 release in October to help slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. While a Windows release normally boosts computer sales, analysts believe it might not help as much this time. At the forum, Intel is expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Along with concerns about consumer demand being hurt by the weak economy, manufacturers are reluctant to commit their resources until they have a better idea of which kinds of new devices will become hits with consumers. “In the absence of knowing what to sell, there’s a clear reluctance to build any sort of further inventory.” Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel. Intel said it now expects third-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from its previous forecast of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $14.2 billion. The company is due to report third-quarter results in October. Intel processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt chips for smartphones and tablets and now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Intel’s new Medfield processor, showcased in phones launched this year in Russia, India and the United Kingdom, surprised some critics who believed the chips would consume too much power. Motorola Mobility, owned by Google Inc, is expected to unveil an Intel-based smartphone in London on September 18, the first of a multi-device agreement with the chipmaker. “They have a respectable seat at the (mobile) table because they surprised a lot of people with Medfield and just how well that did perform,” said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Their big chance to get more credibility will come with Motorola.” The company said on Friday that full-year capital spending is expected to fall short of its previous forecast of $12.1 billion to $12.9 billion. It expects gross margin of 62 percent for the third quarter, plus or minus 1 percentage point, down from its previous expectation of 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel shares were down 3.7 percent at $24.16 on Friday afternoon. AMD was off 4.9 percent at $3.48. PC graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp was down 1.9 percent at $13.47. ASML’s Nasdaq-traded shares were down 1.7 percent at $56.88, and stock of chip gear maker Applied Materials Inc was down 0.7 percent at $11.83. "
2016-04-19,-5,"Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits. Intel’s shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Most of Intel's factories are in the United States, although it did not identify where cuts would be focused geographically. It said it would record a pretax restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and expected annual savings of $1.4 billion per year starting mid-2017. (bit.ly/1WDPfBm) The company also said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Intel said it would begin a formal search process for a new CFO. Smith said that Intel now expects the PC market to decline by a percentage in the high single digits in 2016 versus a prior forecast of a mid single-digit decline. Declines in China and other emerging markets are also leading to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. “PC demand, at least in the eyes of Intel, is expected to be weaker than the industry originally anticipated,” said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P Capital Global Market Intelligence. He added that although the industry has already seen some of the weakness experienced by Intel, the company’s comments dashed any hope of recovery. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data center business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market. Intel has also made inroads into the mobile devices market, although competitors Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Samsung Electronics Co(005930.KS) dominate there. Intel said in a statement the job cuts would be carried out by mid-2017 and the restructuring would “accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.” Sales of products for the data center and the Internet of things accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the majority of operating profit, it added. Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann, who rates Intel “under perform” said the problems leading to the job cuts were likely more about Intel than the broader tech industry.  “The bigger issue is the restructuring and will it be enough for the company to properly adapt to a changing environment where cloud and IoT competitive dynamics are quite different,” Mosesmann added. On a per share basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from 41 cents a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion. Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents. Up to Tuesday’s close, Intel’s shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year, compared with a slight gain in the broader semiconductor index .SOX. "
2014-01-06,1,"With PC sales falling and smartphone growth tapering off, Intel and other technology companies are betting that movement-sensing bracelets, biometric patches and other wearable electronic devices may catch on with consumers and become major markets. The evolving category is a major theme at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with several companies expected to unveil their own versions of intelligent and connected clothing. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. The company has struggled in past attempts to expand beyond the PC arena. A years-long project to provide consumer TV services was shelved last year with its technology put up for sale and the company’s mobile processors have barely made a dent in the global smartphone market even after major improvements to them. After replacing former CEO Paul Otellini in May, Krzanich, a chip manufacturing and operations guru, created a new division focused on identifying future technology trends and making sure Intel is not caught off-guard again. In his keynote presentation at the technology show, Krzanich introduced some of that group’s early results, including sample gadgets that Intel is promoting to consumer device manufacturers. “We’re looking at a broad ecosystem of wearables, not just the device or the silicon,” he said. The company unveiled a tiny computer built with Intel’s low-power Quark technology and packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products. Luxury department store Barneys New York is collaborating with Intel to develop smart bracelets that look like they were created by a fashion designer and not by an engineer. At the event, Krzanich also showed off Intel’s take on stereo earbuds for exercise enthusiasts that - as well as playing music - measure the wearer’s heartbeat through their ears. While other companies have launched similar pulse-taking audiophones, Intel’s are powered through a microphone jack that connects to the user’s smartphone, instead of a separate power source. In addition, integrated software can automatically change the music being played in order to encourage the wearer to speed up or slow down their workout depending on their heart rate. Intel also showed off a Bluetooth earpiece and microphone that the chipmaker says improves the responsiveness of personal assistant smartphone software like Apple’s Siri. The gadget features always-on technology that makes it easier to ask questions of the device and also monitors the user’s environment in order to avoid interrupting. “The real key here is seamless, no buttons, always listening, but it still has that low-power capability,” Krzanich said. Krzanich also showed a smartwatch meant for kids with “geo-fencing” capabilities that alert parents if their children stray from established walking routes to and from home or school or don’t arrive on time. "
2012-02-09,-22,"Intel’s $6.5 million payment represents less than five hours of profit for the Santa Clara, California-based company, based on reported net income of $12.94 billion for 2011. Cuomo had accused Intel of violating state and federal antitrust law through a “systematic worldwide campaign” to bully customers into buying its personal computer chips, at the expense of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But the lawsuit lost much of its punch when U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark said the state could not seek triple damages, and was allowed to pursue claims over just three years of computer purchases, not four or six as it had sought. Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said the state’s lawyers still believe their substantive claims have merit, but that “in light of the court’s decision believe that no purpose is served by pursuing the matter further.” Intel said it was pleased to settle, and that the accord did not require it to admit to any allegations or violation of law, or make any changes to its business. “We have always said that Intel’s business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” General Counsel Doug Melamed said in a statement. Cuomo had contended that Intel bribed or coerced computer makers such as Dell Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and International Business Machines Corp, and threatened retaliation. Emails showed that top Intel officers including Chief Executive Paul Otellini were aware of some of the improper activity, Cuomo alleged. Intel has long faced allegations of anticompetitive conduct, and is still appealing a 1.06 billion euro (now US$1.41 billion) fine imposed in 2009 by European regulators. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a case in which it accused Intel of unlawfully stifling competition in microprocessors. The same year, a different Delaware federal judge approved a settlement with shareholders that called for Intel to make more than 40 corporate governance changes, including the creation of a compliance committee to monitor antitrust litigation. And in November 2009, barely a week after Cuomo sued, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25 billion to settle all outstanding legal disputes with its smaller rival. Intel is incorporated in Delaware. The case is New York v. Intel Corp, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 09-00827. "
2012-03-06,3,"* Effort to stay in lead as data centers mushroom * HP, Dell and others to announce servers - Intel By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  took the wraps off its newest “Xeon” server chip on Tuesday, seeking to capitalize on an explosion of Internet traffic sparked by Web-based cloud computing, social networking and growing smartphone and tablet computer use. The company’s “Xeon E5-2600” family of processors delivers up to 80 percent better performance than previous platforms while consuming less energy, Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, told reporters. It is designed to support the servers and workstations that handle what Intel estimates will be 33 percent annual growth of  data traffic through 2015. Intel has already shipped its new platform to a host of server manufacturers. It said several - including Hewlett-Packard Co, Dell Inc, IBM, Oracle Corp and Cisco Systems Inc - are expected to announce Xeon-based server platforms on Tuesday. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is also stepping up investments in enterprise processors. Last week, the perennial runner-up to Intel announced that it would buy micro-server player SeaMicro for $334 million, getting into an emergent, power-efficient server technology. AMD has lost ground to Intel in the server market in past years but hopes SeaMicro can help its expansion into low-power solutions in massive data centers. But Intel executives said their own Xeon E5 platform can improve energy efficiency by more than 50 percent in some cases versus the previous generation. “We did look at SeaMicro’s fabric technology. There are probably very few people they didn’t come to and shop their solution to,” Bryant said. “We were not impressed. We declined and very soon after our competitor acquired them.” While Intel lags Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics  in selling processors for smartphones and tablets, Intel executives have pointed to their server business as key to capitalizing on fast growth in the mobile market. The popularity of smartphones and other mobile gadgets has increased the need for massive computer centers that store data and feed email, videos and other information to those devices. UBS expects spending on data centers to surge 49 percent this year, driven by the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google. At Tuesday’s event, Intel trotted out a variety of clients to demonstrate how its new platform might be employed. German automaker BMW said it was using Xeon-based servers to keep its luxury cars linked to the Internet. “Soon we will have more than 10 million vehicles connected and that will lead us to 1 terabyte of data volume per day,” said Mario Muller, BMW vice president of IT infrastructure."
2013-06-07,-2,"But Intel has yet to close any programming deals, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. CBS, News Corp and Viacom have reached agreements with Intel on certain details over how their content would be distributed on the service the chipmaker plans to begin later this year, one person familiar with the situation said. Comcast’s NBC Universal is continuing its talks with Intel but its negotiations are not as advanced others companies, said another source familiar with the matter. Intel has moved substantially on subscriber fees it is willing to pay since the negotiations began, one source said. It has also suggested preventing viewers from skipping commercials on the first run of a show, said another source. Representatives for Viacom, NBC, CBS, News Corp, Disney’s ABC and Time Warner declined to comment. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, and therefore has no viewers, it can expect to pay a premium, all the sources said. SNL Kagan, a research firm that measures and publishes the average subscriber fees cable and satellite TV operators pay for television networks, recorded last year’s highest fees were $5.15 per subscriber per month and were charged by Disney’s ESPN. While it was not clear exactly what amounts Intel had originally offered for specific channels, sources said the tech company was basing its 50 to 75 percent premium on listed average SNL Kagan subscriber fees. Intel needs deals with the top five or six U.S. media companies to secure most of the popular TV channels, according to one source. Intel said in February that it planned to compete with Apple , Amazon and Google and provide a set-top box and service that would offer live and on-demand programming. Erik Huggers, the head of Intel Media, has said he plans to offer customers smaller bundles of content than those currently being offered by cable and satellite operators. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Huggers has billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Higher prices for consumers would give Intel breathing room to pay more to media companies without sacrificing its own margins. Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said the chipmaker still plans to launch its TV service this year, but declined to give details of negotiations with media companies. Having missed the mobile revolution and fallen behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel senior executives are eager to be on the leading edge of future consumer technologies. Intel sees the living room as a potential battleground, where its advanced chips, used in set-top boxes and to power “cloud” data centers, can give it an advantage and help set the standard for other home entertainment products."

2016-03-21,0,"Grove was Intel’s first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practical-minded member of a triumvirate that eventually led “Intel Inside” processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers. With his motto “only the paranoid survive,” which became the title of his best-selling management book, Grove championed an innovative environment within Intel that became a blueprint for successful California startups. Grove, who was named man of the year by Time magazine in 1997, encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers - or opportunities - for Intel. In doing so, he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay. Grove’s overhaul of Intel’s business - switching from digital memory to processors - was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them. ”It’s not that you shouldn’t plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen,” Grove said. While Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry, Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products. He was responsible for driving growth in Intel’s profits and stock price through the 1980s and 1990s.     Grove went to work in 1963 at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips. At Fairchild, he also met chip visionaries Noyce and Moore, who left to found Intel in 1968. Grove quickly joined them, running research and manufacturing. He became Intel’s president in 1979, CEO in 1987 and chairman and CEO in 1997. He gave up his CEO title in 1998 and stayed on as chairman until 2004.  In its early years, Intel focused on making DRAM memory chips. When Japanese competition soared, Grove made the fateful decision to reinvent Intel as a manufacturer of microprocessors – the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices. As the personal computer industry took off in the 1980s, Intel supplied its processors to IBM and then to Compaq and other manufacturers making “IBM clone” PCs.  Intel’s chips, along with Microsoft’s Windows operating system, quickly became an industry standard in the exploding PC industry, with Grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors. Under his stewardship, the Pentium brand and “Intel Inside” logo became widely recognized by consumers. Intel remains one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies but the PC chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets. Grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the United States, arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products - like batteries or televisions - meant U.S. companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs. Intel still makes most of its chips in U.S. plants. During his time at Intel in the 1990s Grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in Fortune magazine, criticizing the medical establishment’s treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research. In later life, Grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on Parkinson’s disease, a condition he suffered from. He also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry. Grove and his wife, Eva, who married a year after meeting while working at a resort in New Hampshire in 1957, had two daughters. "
2016-05-26,0,"By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday became the title sponsor of the most prestigious U.S. science competition for high school students, taking the baton from chipmaker Intel Corp . Regeneron pledged $100 million to support the Science Talent Search and related programs through 2026, and doubled awards for the top 300 scientists and their schools, to $2,000 each. Regeneron’s two top executives competed in the annual event during the 1970s and went on to build one of the world’s biggest biotech companies, with cutting-edge drugs for fighting macular degeneration, cancer and cholesterol. The fast-growing biotech company will take over as named sponsor from Intel, whose chips were helping build the personal computer industry in 1998 when it took over as sponsor from Westinghouse. That storied electronics and industrial giant had sponsored the talent search from 1942 to 1997. The competition, overseen by the nonprofit Society for Science & the Public, receives applications annually from more than 1,800 high school seniors, along with their original research in all areas of science, including mathematics. The field is winnowed to 300 young scientists, among whom 40 become finalists for a competition in Washington, D.C. Regeneron Chief Executive Len Schleifer competed in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search in 1970 with a project on Euclidian geometry. Company research chief George Yancopoulos was a top winner in 1976 for research that involved cutting protozoans in half to see what factors enabled the tiny organisms to regenerate. The young scholars stuck to the regeneration theme when Schleifer started Regeneron in 1988, with Yancopoulos its founding scientist. The company focused on discovering nerve-growth proteins that could regenerate neurons. They hoped to find cures for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Those lofty efforts failed, but the company kept the Regeneron name as it changed course and focused on other diseases. A teacher at Forest Hills High School, in Queens, New York, encouraged Schleifer to enter the Westinghouse competition and gave him inspiration that has lasted a lifetime. “It taught me the value of having a teacher who really cared and served as my mentor,” said Schleifer. He expressed concern that many fine young scientific minds have been lost over recent decades to more-glamorous fields like investment banking, but said the Regeneron Science Talent Search will hopefully keep many others on track. Intel in March said its sponsorship would be ending but provided no details. Company executives declined further comment on Wednesday, including whether the discontinued sponsorship was related to austerity moves as Intel moves forward with 12,000 planned job cuts globally.

2016-04-17,-2,"Investors who do not own stock in Intel should wait until after the earnings call to buy shares, it added.  Intel has struggled to grow as demand for personal computer chips has dried up, Barron’s said, but growth in the company’s data center group, which includes server chips, could eventually bring in more revenue.  The gap between the two businesses has closed over the past five years.  Last year, the data center business’s operating profit was $7.8 billion, slightly below the $8.2 billion earned by Intel’s client computing division, which includes chips for desktop and notebook computers. In 2010, the data center division brought in just $4.4 billion, compared to the personal computer business’s $13 billion.  Meanwhile, the company’s Internet of Things division, which includes chips for cars, medical devices and factories, composed just 4 percent of revenue last year but is growing at a high-single-digit pace.

2013-06-28,8,"SAN FRANCISCO, June 28 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s new CEO said on Friday he would speed up the rollout of chips for smartphones, tablets and wearable devices as consumers move away from personal computers. Brian Krzanich, an Intel manufacturing guru who took over as chief executive officer in May, also took a cautious tone about the top chipmaker’s planned foray into television and said Intel continues to look at the business model. “We believe we have a great user interface and the compression-decompression technology is fantastic,” Krzanich said. “But in the end, if we want to provide that service it comes down to content. We are not big content players.” In their first sit-down with reporters since their promotions in May, Krzanich and Intel President Renee James said wearable computing devices would become a key battleground for mobile industry players. Krzanich, who mentioned he had Google’s Glass wearable device in his knapsack, said computing in the next few years would focus more on items for eyes and ears, as well as wristbands and watches. “I think you’ll start to see stuff with our silicon toward the end of the year and the beginning of next year,” Krzanich said. “We’re trying to get our silicon into some of them, create some ourselves, understand the usage and create an ecosystem.” The world’s biggest chipmaker dominates the PC industry, but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Intel is anxious to make sure it does not fall behind in future technology trends. Krzanich and James said that under their leadership, Intel will give much more priority to its Atom mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. “We see that Atom is now at the same importance, it’s launching on the same leading edge technology, sometimes even coming before Core (Intel’s line of PC chips),” said Krzanich. “We are in the process of looking at all of our roadmaps and evaluating the timing of some of those products. It’s fair to say there are things we would like to accelerate.” Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and other smartphone manufacturers favor processors designed with architecture licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc , a trend Intel would like to reverse. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s iPhone chips. “If there was a great customer that we had a great relationship with laptops and other mobile devices, and they said look, we’d really love you to build our ARM-based product, we’d consider it. It depends on how strategic they are,” Krzanich said. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, said he changes laptops and smartphones about once a month to try new ones out. He is currently using a Samsung Galaxy phone and a Lenovo Helix laptop with a detachable keyboard. Under previous CEO Paul Otellini, Intel embarked on a plan to launch an Internet television service with live and on-demand content, entering a hotly competitive race outside its core chip business. While Intel has said it expects to launch its service later this year, as of earlier this month it had not yet finalized programming deals with major content companies. It faces competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, as well as traditional cable companies. “We’re being cautious. We’re experts in silicon, we’re experts in mobility, in driving Moore’s law,” Krzanich said. “But we are not experts in the content industry and we’re being careful.” Processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O>, Samsung and Nvidia Corp account for most of the mobile market. But Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. Samsung has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time. And last month, the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption that some experts believe might help it compete better against Qualcomm."
2013-05-16,1,"“Yes, we missed it, we were slow to tablets and some of the mobile computing. We do believe we have a good base,” Krzanich told shareholders at an annual meeting. Krzanich, a 30-year Intel veteran who made his name running Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing plants, said he and software honcho Renee James, who the board elevated to president, have already started meeting with manufacturing customers. “They’re all showing us - here’s where the market’s moving and here’s where we need Intel to move,” Krzanich said. “We’re going to make adjustments in our architecture and our product choices.” Intel for decades has called the shots in the personal computer industry but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Intel’s strength has traditionally come from its manufacturing prowess, and Krzanich’s promotion is seen as confirmation by the board that the company’s multibillion-dollar network of cutting-edge factories still holds the key to success. James’ promotion underscores a belief in Intel that software and other related services are also important ingredients. “I think the emphasis is important,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said of Krzanich’s remarks. “A focus on the end-customer, a focus on execution and a really strong focus on the ultra-mobile segment of the business. That’s pretty important,” Smith told Reuters. Last week, Intel unveiled the most extensive overhaul to date of its Atom mobile processors that underpin its push into smartphones and tablets. Intel’s processors have been used in a handful of smartphones in Asia, Africa and Europe but the company has yet to release Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line. "
2013-11-20,-9,"The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project said Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer, as first reported by the AllThingsD website. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc Google Inc Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in Feburary 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC, CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.” "
2013-09-04,0,"The Santa Clara, California, company said on Wednesday the new Atom chips, which are meant for microservers, networking equipment and storage at major cloud-computing providers, perform six times better than previous versions. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry as well as servers but the company has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets. Most of those devices use low-power chips made by Qualcomm Inc and other companies using technology licensed from ARM Holdings. Advanced Micro Devices Inc and other companies now plan to use ARM’s technology to make low-power microserver chips for data centers, a market Intel is determined to defend. Intel’s new chips are made with the company’s 22-nanometer manufacturing technology, which is at least a year ahead of rivals. The chips are based on a new microarchitecture called Silvermont. “Data centers have always been a high-margin business. Microservers are a beachhead, and Intel is trying to kill the attacking army,” said Gartner analyst Sergis Mushell. In May, Intel announced Silvermont, the first overhaul of the Atom chip line since it was introduced for notebooks in 2008 and eventually expanded to include versions for mobile gadgets, data centers and car entertainment systems. The new Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used in a range of car models with different features. Silvermont is also the basis for Intel’s new 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips, shipping this month, and upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips. "
2014-09-22,0,"The U.S. chip giant plans to hire close to 1,000 more workers at the plant in the southern town of Kiryat Gat by 2023, in addition to the 2,500 that already work there. “Intel’s investment is a strategic asset for Israel’s industry,” Finance Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement. “This is the biggest investment by a foreign company ever in Israel and is further proof that Israel is at the forefront of technology and innovation.” Intel submitted the investment plan in May and it is widely believed to be aimed at shifting to new 10 nanometer technology. The finance ministry said the plant would be the most advanced chip facility in the world. A company spokesman declined to comment. Intel had said January that it would decide on the location of a 10 nanometer plant this year. Israel was one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant.  Intel Israel’s exports, mainly from its Fab 28 plant in Kiryat Gat, amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centers and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people in the Jewish state. "
2012-11-21,2,"Intel came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, insisting that emerging markets would prop up growth while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand, and orchestrating a push on “Ultrabook” laptops that have so far failed to excite consumers. A future leader not steeped in Intel’s insular culture could potentially open the chipmaker’s prized factories for the first time to outside customers like Apple Inc or pursue other new strategies to expand into tablets and smartphones, said analyst Nathan Brookwood of Insight 64, a consulting firm. But any investor hoping Intel will hire an outsider with a dramatic solution to the top chipmaker’s PC plight may be out of luck, experts say. While the idea of an iconic visionary like Steve Jobs stepping in to lift Intel into the mobile market - its Achilles heel - may sound attractive, it could open the chipmaker to new risks should it waver from its traditional focus on hard-core manufacturing. Gurus with the experience to run a company with $53 billion a year in sales, a $10 billion capital spending budget and cutting-edge chip manufacturing plants are few and far between - and even rarer outside of Intel, which is struggling with falling PC sales and meager progress in mobile computing. “If you bring someone in who hasn’t run chip companies it’s going to be very difficult because Intel is somewhat unique,” said Patrick Henry, CEO of Entropic Communications, which makes chips for home entertainment. “It would probably surprise me if they didn’t hire one of the internal guys.” Silicon Valley peer Hewlett-Packard Co exemplifies the risks of a poorly thought-out external hire, recruiters and analysts say. During his tumultuous 11-month tenure, former software CEO Leo Apotheker engineered the widely panned $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, which HP accused this week of accounting wrongdoing enroute to swallowing an $8.8 billion charge. [ID:nL4N0902ZH] He also presided over several quarters of lackluster financial results. “I don’t think (Intel) needs a 180-degree transformation. You don’t want somebody like a Leo Apotheker coming on and being your complete undoing,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “Because of how badly things have gone for HP, the most probable scenario for (Intel) at the end of all this in May is that it looks very much the same.” But Mel Connet, a tech industry executive recruiter at Heritage Search Partners in Menlo Park, California, said Intel’s culture needs a shakeup that justifies looking for an outside candidate, while being mindful of the HP example. “My only advice would be not to use the same search firm that HP used,” said Connet, whose firm has not been contracted by Intel for its search. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith is well known by financial analysts and many favor him, believing he is the best bet for keeping Intel stable. The company’s other executive vice presidents are Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani; and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile. They are well respected but are mentioned less often as potential picks. Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said a CEO hired from the ranks would have instant credibility among the company’s tight-knit workforce, which includes over 4,000 PhDs. “There’s no silver bullet. The issue here is not any sort of miss-execution on their part,” said Rasgon. “Their market is changing beneath their feet.” Otellini’s decision to retire, announced Monday, caught the board unprepared to replace him, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy has said. All of Intel’s previous CEO successions were planned long in advance, leaving no room for instability. While Intel said it would include external candidates in its search for a new CEO, it also announced the promotion of Krzanich, Smith and James to executive vice presidents, suggesting that they remain serious potential candidates. Mulloy has said Intel veterans will have a natural advantage in winning the CEO position because they are familiar with the company’s manufacturing-intensive business model and insular, engineering culture. Its cutting-edge fabrication plants are the envy of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), and helped it cement its leadership over decades. But more recently, Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, and Wall Street increasingly worries the chipmaker may be left behind in the fast-growing mobile market. It has pinned its mobile hopes on its superior manufacturing technology, but that strategy has yet to pay off. To date Intel’s market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc and Samsung. Since all but a handful of U.S. chipmakers have shuttered their fabrication plants in the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running advanced plants that cost nearly $10 billion each to build. “The perfect choice, which I don’t think exists right now, is somebody who can manage massive fabs - and also mobility. They don’t exist outside of Samsung, and that’s just not going to happen. There’s a culture clash,” said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy. Insight 64’s Brookwood believes a “Lou Gerstner-type” of executive with a fresh approach could shake up Intel but said such a candidate need not come from outside. Gerstner left RJR Nabisco to run International Business Machines Corp in 1993 and is widely seen as saving the struggling technology giant by focusing on IT services instead of products, in a radical shift. Intel believes its manufacturing strength is its key to succeeding in mobile computing, even if it takes a while for that strategy to pay off. Gauna said Intel’s future CEO should stick to that strategy, although it would be good for that person to have better ties to the mobile world as well as software companies seen as vital for tablets and smartphones. For example, Intel-based smartphones running the Android platform debuted just this year but could have been launched sooner had Otellini been more aggressive, Gauna said. “How they weave in the software strategy and the partnerships within the software and (manufacturing customer) marketplace - that’s where it gets really interesting,” Gauna said. “If I could paint a picture of what it needs to look like I’d put my hat in the ring myself.” "
2013-10-30,-4,"Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp is having second thoughts about getting into the television business and is in talks with Verizon Communications Inc to take over its Internet TV initiative, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The news was first reported on tech website All Things D, citing anonymous sources. While discussions are in the advanced stages, it was still unclear if Verizon plans to take full control of Intel’s media unit or if Intel would maintain a stake in the unit, the report said. Representatives from Intel and Verizon both declined to comment. Earlier this year, Intel decided to launch an Internet TV service with live and on-demand content in a bid to find an alternative revenue stream as its core business of providing chips to computer makers erodes. It hired hundreds of workers and opened offices in Los Angeles and New York to work on the project. The field of players competing for in-home entertainment audiences is increasingly crowded. Apple Inc, Google Inc, Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp  are jockeying for position to own the living room through TV, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s  streaming video services have millions of subscribers. Verizon already has a streaming product as part of a joint venture with Redbox, which focuses mostly on streaming movies and not on TV shows, according to its website. That product competes with Netflix. Intel has struggled to reach content deals with media companies even though it offered to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, which is far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing."

2014-05-05,-2,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 5 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has hired senior Staples executive Steven Fund to oversee its global marketing, a novel pick that the chipmaker hopes will improve its profile in an industry where laptops have become blase compared to tablets and smartphones. As chief marketing officer, Fund will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, in line with other changes Krzanich has made to have more senior executives report directly to him since taking over the top management post last year. Intel’s previous CMO, Deborah Conrad, reported to the general manager of sales and marketing, Tom Kilroy, who is currently on medical leave. Fund is Krzanich’s first senior hire but only his latest shakeup at the chipmaker, which has been struggling with a shrinking PC industry and a lack of progress selling its products to makers of smartphones and tablets. “As our industry and our business is changing, we need to change the way we develop, build, and market our products, and Steve is going to be a key asset for us as we move forward,” Krzanich said in a statement on Monday. Fund, who was senior vice president of global marketing at Staples, also helped build brands at Procter & Gamble and at Pepsi-Cola, according to the statement. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. But Intel’s brand has lost a little of its shine in recent years. In 2013, Intel was No. 9 on consulting firm Interbrand’s global ranking, down from No. 7 in 2011. Conrad, a 27-year Intel veteran, left in March after Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion that the company needed to get some of the “coolness” back in its marketing. Intel in recent years has led personal computer makers in marketing sleek “ultrabook” laptops and two-in-one notebooks that convert into tablets. But those new gadgets have made little headway in stopping a decline in PC sales. Within days of being promoted to CEO last May, Krzanich reorganized Intel so that its main product groups would report directly to him. Kilroy is on leave fighting cancer and his duties are being covered by Greg Pearson, general manager of World Wide Sales and Operations.

2012-09-07,-6,"The chipmaker’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but the company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and it trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Intel spokeswoman Kathy Gill said Intel is constantly hiring and that the jobs advertised this week would expand Intel’s existing bench of tablet software experts. Although mainly a manufacturer, Intel sees focusing in-house on software as increasingly important to making sure its chips work efficiently. The company says in the ad it was looking for people with several years experience in Windows, wireless and cameras. With consumers increasingly turning to mobile devices, Intel cut its third-quarter revenue estimate on Friday, pointing to declining demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer PCs.

The gap between the two businesses has closed over the past five years.  Last year, the data center business’s operating profit was $7.8 billion, slightly below the $8.2 billion earned by Intel’s client computing division, which includes chips for desktop and notebook computers. In 2010, the data center division brought in just $4.4 billion, compared to the personal computer business’s $13 billion.

2014-04-08,-8,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel, struggling with a shrinking personal computer market, is shutting its assembly and test operation in Costa Rica and eliminating 1,500 jobs, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The closure of the site, which is a significant contributor to Costa Rica’s exports, falls within a larger plan announced by the chipmaker earlier this year to cut spending as it attempts to grow beyond PCs into the mobile market. “It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Still, Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded.

Increased spending may further pressure margins and leave Intel with even more idle capacity if PC sales keep falling. But others believe that Intel’s top priority must be maintaining its technological edge, a costly but necessary endeavor that may even pay off in the long run with market share gains. Moving up the technology ladder can also deliver cost savings, helping safeguarding Intel’s margins as it tries to catch up to rivals in smartphones and tablets. “That’s the bet they’re making and they’re all in,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “If you stop, TSMC and Samsung close the gap - and you’re toast.” Of Intel’s $13 billion capex this year, $2 billion will go toward expanding a fabrication plant, or fab, in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 mm - about the size of a large pizza. The other $11 billion goes toward more immediate improvements in Intel’s manufacturing technology, letting it build chips over the next two or three years with features measuring just 14 nanometers, and then 10 nm. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. The newest fabs currently use 300 mm wafers, about the size of a vinyl record. Moving up in size will make room for more than twice as many chips to be etched on each, leading to cost savings. Lowering costs will be a serious priority for Intel as it ventures into the tablet and phone markets, where chips sell for much less than in the PC industry. Intel, which has yet to make meaningful progress in mobile, stresses that its most advanced fabs have the lowest cost per chip produced. “One of reasons why Intel is so aggressive on capital spending is to maximize the chances it has of protecting its gross margins as it moves into smaller and lower priced CPUs,” Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney said. Investors in the past have criticized Amazon.com Inc for splurging on costly warehouses and other shipping facilities, investments that eventually paid off and contributed to rich stock valuations. While the size of Intel’s capex increase alarmed investors, the chipmaker since 2011 has been spending heavily. Intel normally pours 12 to 16 percent of its revenue into capex, but spending has been closer to 20 percent in the past two years and will probably be higher this year, Feeney estimated. The costs of developing the new technology to use 450 mm fabs are so high that just a few companies, such as Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan’s TSMC, are expected to have the scale to make the jump worthwhile. Building 450 mm plants from the ground up is expected to cost $10 billion or more. It’s not just a matter of creating bigger silicon wafers. Most of the high-tech equipment - sold by the likes of Applied Materials - used in chip manufacturing has to be redesigned as well. The transition from 300 mm to 450 mm is so expensive and complicated that the world’s biggest chipmakers and tool makers are collaborating to establish new standards and timing new technology. Intel made a $3 billion strategic equity investment last year in chip equipment supplier ASML to help fund the development of future lithography tools for 450 mm fabs, a move followed by rivals Samsung and TSMC. Intel’s Oregon plant will lead the effort to produce chips on 450 mm wafers, with other larger Intel plants upgraded in the future, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters on Thursday. Rasgon said Intel’s long-term investments in manufacturing will mean more pressure on its margins over the next few years, but that its spending will help ensure it remains a major player in the chip industry over the next decade - though there’s no guarantee. “If there’s any company I can look at five years from now, they’ll be here and they’ll be really successful at whatever they’re doing. But I don’t know what they’ll look like,” Rasgon said. “They have to do this, but it doesn’t mean I want to own the stock while they’re doing it.” "
2013-02-12,0,"He said hundreds of Intel employees and their families are already testing a set-top box the company will sell as part of the service. Intel’s move puts it into competition with heavyweights like Apple, Amazon and Google that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The chipmaker plans to offer consumers smaller bundles of content than those currently offered by cable operators, Erik Huggers, vice president and general manager of Intel Media, told the AllThingsDigital “Dive into Media” conference on Tuesday. Asked if Intel has inked any content deals, Huggers said he is working with providers and is confident Intel will have a compelling product to launch this year. “We have been working for (the past) year to set up Intel media, a new group focused on developing an Internet platform,” Huggers said. “It’s not a value play, it’s a quality play where we’ll create a superior experience for the end user.” Intel has struggled to get its virtual television service off the ground due to unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let the company unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay, according to sources. Silicon Valley has been taking aim at the U.S. cable television market - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. Technology companies see opportunities due to reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to mounting programming costs. “There is an opportunity to offer a bundle that can be curated by the consumer, an opportunity to create smarter bundles,” Huggers said. Intel’s set-top-box will also have a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. “There’s a scenario where the TV recognizes that it’s you and says ‘Hey, I know what you like. I know what you want to watch’, versus the environment we’re in today where the TV literally is not interested in you at all,” Huggers told Reuters In an interview. Some media executives are skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make its service viable. That view was shared by Bernard Gershon, head of digital consultancy GershonMedia and a former Disney senior vice president for strategic planning who helped develop Disney’s online strategy. “The chance that Intel launches is zero,” Gershon, who speaks with media and digital executives, told Reuters at the conference. “They haven’t cut any deals with any content companies, and they are not offering something that differentiates itself enough on service or price to get the deals done.” Analysts see Intel’s leap into Internet television, along with its growing focus on smartphones and tablets, as a way to diversify beyond the slowing PC market. “The question you have to ask with Intel is, Is anything they do big enough to move the needle?” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “You’re not going to make or break the company on something like this.” Huggers said in the interview that Intel employees are testing the device’s user interface, sound and picture quality and other features. “We’re actively testing it in the field with employees. It’s not the final product, but it’s certainly functional,” he said. Industry insiders have said Apple may unveil a TV-based device that has the potential to shake up the cozy television content and distribution industry the way the iPod and iPhone disrupted music and mobile content. Sources say Apple, which already sells a $99 set top box called Apple TV that streams Netflix and other content, has opened discussions with providers but it is unclear how much headway it has made, despite its reputation as a tough negotiator. Huggers previously worked at Microsoft and the BBC, where in 2007 he launched iPlayer, an online service letting viewers catch up with programs they missed on regular television. “The model we envision is a model where live television and catch-up television live in the same paradigm,” Huggers said. Intel’s shares closed up 0.76 percent, at $21.19. "
2013-07-17,-2,"The soft-spoken manufacturing guru, who took over as CEO in May and faces falling PC sales and a hyper-competitive mobile market, was quick to acknowledge Intel’s past errors. He said the top chipmaker would aggressively speed up the rollout of new Atom mobile chips. “Intel was slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trends,” Krzanich said. “We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology.” Within days of taking over in May, Krzanich launched a sweeping company reorganization. He has also been spending a lot of time with manufacturing customers, meetings that will quickly lead to more mobile business for Intel, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to make its chips suitable for smartphones and tablets. Smith said that in the fast-expanding mobile market, where Qualcomm (QCOM.O) is the leading chip supplier, customers want more options. “They want alternatives in a market kind of becoming dominated by one player and they see us as being a very capable supplier,” Smith said. “They wanted to look Brian in the eye, and now he’s looking back and saying ‘We’re going to double our efforts here.'” Smith, said in an earlier interview on CNBC that the chipmaker had seen softer sales in China than it had anticipated. Faced with slow demand, Intel said it was cutting 2013 capital spending to $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The cut follows a similar reduction from $13 billion to $12 billion in April. Intel said it expects 2013 revenue to be flat from the year before. Last quarter Intel forecast a low single digit percentage increase in 2013. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon compared Intel’s reduction of expectations on Wednesday to a similar “reset” in 2012. Global shipments of personal computers dropped 11 percent in the second quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline in a market that has been devastated by the popularity of tablets. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is eager to build on. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time. And in May, the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption that some experts believe might help it compete better against Qualcomm. Shares of Intel have risen about 16 percent this year and trade at the equivalent of 12 times expected earnings, a valuation similar to that of Qualcomm’s stock. Krzanich left open the possibility of opening Intel’s factories to more customers making chips designed with architectures that differ from Intel’s own, a side business that so far has remained very small. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhone chips. “We are taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders,” he said. Intel posted second-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion and said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.896 billion in revenue for the second quarter and $13.732 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the second quarter, Intel reported net earnings of $2.0 billion, or 39 cents a share, in line with expectations. That compared with $2.827 billion, or 54 cents, in the same quarter last year. Shares of Intel fell about 4 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.41 percent at $24.15 on the Nasdaq. "
2015-01-29,0,"With a recovery in the PC industry driven in part by consumers buying cheap, low-end laptops, corporations buying top-tier devices for their workers are an important sweet spot for Intel and manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell.  Shipments of Intel’s vPro processors, which are more profitable for the Santa Clara, California, company than many of its other PC chips, are increasing compared with overall demand for desktop and laptop computers, he said. “We’re growing at double digits from 2014 over 2013,” Garrison said. “There are 100 million vPros installed in businesses today.” Earlier in January, Intel said it expects the overall PC market to be about flat this year and for average prices to decline slightly. In its newest vPro offering, based on the company’s recently launched 5th generation Core chips and announced on Thursday, Intel is touting features aimed at eliminating time wasted at the start of conference-room meetings. vPro computers can use wifi to connect directly to overhead projectors and other large screens without having to fiddle with cables. The new chips use the similar technology to eliminate the need for docking stations used at office workstations to connect laptops to monitors and keyboards. vPro chips are used for laptops, desktops and convertible devices. Similar features are already available for consumer devices but the versions used on vPro chips offer better security and reliability, Garrison said. "
2016-04-21,2,"Chipmaker Intel has seen its share price drop 2 percent over the last year, as software maker Microsoft’s stock has risen 30 percent. Microsoft’s market capitalization of around $439.68 billion is almost three times Intel’s at $150.96 billion, compared to about double five years ago. “Wintel” computers running Windows on Intel chips dominated the personal-computing era, which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops. Both Intel and Microsoft, run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella, are betting their businesses on the cloud. Microsoft’s cloud business, a combination of services and software catering to corporations moving computing functions to remote data centers run by outside providers, is growing strongly, although analysts want more clarity. A category it calls “intelligent cloud,” which includes traditional server software, grew 3 percent over the last year to $9.46 billion. At Intel, in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as it shifts away from the PC, data-center business revenue rose 9 percent to $4 billion. That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers, where the company says it is doing well. “There’s this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this (cloud) trend,” said Dan Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio. “Intel is still more drowned out,” meaning not as high-profile. Microsoft’s best-known play in the cloud is Azure, a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers. Azure is gaining ground on Amazon’s AWS unit, the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services. Azure commands about 10 percent of the $23 billion market, estimates Synergy Research, compared with AWS’s 31 percent. Intel has done well in its category, dominating the market for processor chips that are the brains of data center computers, but the business faces major pressures. Much of the difference in the companies’ fortunes boils down to Microsoft’s fundamental business as a software company versus Intel’s as a hardware company, argues Nick Sturiale, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners. Clients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel’s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group. “The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,” said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest. Intel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips. In a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel’s “top to bottom” understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead. “Always paranoid about the competition, always driving,” he said. “And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.” Intel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off. And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come.  Much of its “intelligent cloud” business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment’s name “is to align to the ambition” of  building the cloud. Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term “cloud” came up 59 times. In Intel’s call this week, it came up 11 times.

2013-03-18,3,"In a major divergence from its core business of manufacturing chips for PCs, Intel plans to sell consumers a television set-top box that offers live programming as well as on-demand content in small bundles. It will compete with heavyweights like Apple Inc, Amazon Inc and Google Inc that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The service, announced in February, would go further than products currently offered by Apple, Netflix and others. But some media executives and analysts have been skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make the service viable. Carvill declined to comment on the progress of content negotiations other than to say Intel is engaged with partners and remains confident it will launch later this year. Intel Media, led by former BBC executive Erik Huggers, is looking for engineers experienced in cloud computing, user interface design and security. Intel also wants specialists in Hadoop, a platform used for mining vast troves of digital data. That could point toward a heavy emphasis on analyzing customers’ viewing habits. Huggers has said the product’s set-top box will include a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. One job ad on Intel’s website is for an “audience representative” who would be responsible for communicating with customers via phone, chat, email, and possibly video. Among the qualifications, “Must be weird.” "
2014-01-26,0,"“Intel will take its decision as late as possible. Until it needs to, it won’t make a decision,” Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told a news conference. “If we’re looking at the next technology it has to come this year, but we don’t know when.” Intel has already held talks with the Israeli government, which must offer incentives to be competitive, said Fassberg, manager of Intel’s Fab 28 plant in the southern town of Kiryat Gat. “There is no certainty it will be in Israel. The jury is still out; we are in the game,” said Mooly Eden, president of Intel Israel and general manager of perceptual computing. Intel Israel’s exports amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. Eden said the 2012 number was inflated by inventory carried over from 2011 as the plant upgraded to improved technology. “Overall I believe we have a healthy growth,” Eden said. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centers and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people. It received grants totaling 28 percent of its investment when it built Fab 18, which started operating in Israel in 1999. This amount fell to 15 percent for Fab 28 in 2008, and when it upgraded Fab 28, the grant amounted to only 7 percent, she said. “Together with the Israeli government we will do what needs to be done to stay competitive,” Fassberg said.

2014-04-08,-5,"“It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Still, Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. Shares of Intel closed 1.60 percent higher at $26.91 on Nasdaq. "
2012-12-04,-2,"The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said in a filing it plans to use proceeds of the debt sale for general corporate purposes and for stock buybacks under its existing share authorization. “We believe the action should likely prove prudent given low debt borrowing costs,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said of the debt offer in a note to clients. “In our view the raise will likely support increased buybacks.” Intel’s stock has dropped 18 percent over the past year as investors worried about slow PC sales and the company’s failure to expand into mobile gadgets. In the September quarter, Intel spent $1.165 billion on stock buybacks, bringing its repurchases so far in 2012 to $3.765 billion. At the end of that quarter, Intel had another $6.3 billion available for share repurchases under its existing authorization. Some investors have pointed to Intel’s willingness to return cash to investors as a reason to own its stock. It paid $1.1 billion in dividends in the third quarter and its dividend yield stands at about 4.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Intel shares rose 2.19 percent on Tuesday to settle at $19.97. “The cost of money is relatively inexpensive and we have an excellent credit rating. It’s sound financial planning,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. "

2015-05-29,-7,"* Deal would offer 15 pct premium * Deal would be Intel’s largest acquisition * Altera shares up 4.6 pct   (Adds analyst comment and background, updates share movement) By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker May 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has resumed talks to buy programmable-chip maker Altera Corp and is close to a $16 billion deal, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, paving way for the third mega semiconductor-chip deal this year. The price for Altera could be as much as $54 per share, according to one of the people. This would be a 15 percent premium over the stock’s Thursday close of $46.97. If the deal were to go through, it would be Intel’s largest, topping its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It would also underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry - the company’s mainstay - loses steam. The deal will allow Intel to bundle its own server chips with Altera’s line of programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers and are customized for functions such as providing quicker web-searches. “It’s a good deal essentially because it sews up Intel’s data center supremacy even more,” Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said. Intel, since 2013, had been manufacturing chips for Altera, which does not have a foundry. The partnership was unusual for Intel, which has traditionally been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology. Intel made an unsolicited $54 per share offer for Altera in April, but was rejected, sources had told Reuters. “I think Altera was essentially trying to exploit the fact that Intel really needed them,” Sundararajan said. Intel and Altera signed a standstill agreement earlier this year that expires on June 1, giving the world’s largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, Reuters reported last month. News of the renewed takeover attempt comes on the heels of Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion offer for Broadcom Corp  - the largest merger of chipmakers ever. The fragmented chip industry has been expected to consolidate since NXP Semiconductors said in March it would buy Freescale Semiconductor for $12 billion. Altera shares were up 4.6 percent at $49.18 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Intel shares were up 1.3 percent. The deal could be reached in the coming days, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement was certain and asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Intel and Altera did not respond to requests for comment. The New York Post first reported late Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks. "
2013-10-08,-3,"Intel and other technology companies are betting that what they call the “Internet of Things” -- a trend toward connecting everything from bathroom scales, to factory robots and skyscraper ventilation systems to the Internet - will create massive demand for new electronics and software over the next several years. Close to a dozen electronics manufacturers have started using Intel’s new Atom E3800 chip, a variant of Intel’s low-power mobile processors, Ton Steenman, general manager of Intel’s Intelligent Systems Group, told reporters at an event. “It will allow us to reach into a whole new set of applications and billions of devices we have never been able to delve into before,” Steenman said of the new chip. He said the Atom chips became available this quarter and offer features useful in industrial machines, like error correction and the ability to withstand high temperatures. A smaller, scaled down chip, part of Intel’s recently announced Quark line of very low-power components, is due to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2014. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. The Santa Clara, California company is now scrambling to tap into new markets to help it keep its multi-billion dollar fabrication plants humming near full capacity and protect its enviable 63-percent gross margins. Steenman declined to say when he expects chips aimed at the Internet of Things to deliver meaningful sales for Intel, which had revenue of $53 billion last year. He also declined to say how much Intel would charge for the chips. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, estimated that the Atom chips likely sell for between $20 and $50 each, while the Quark chips may be priced near $5 a piece. By comparison, Intel’s powerful, and highly profitable, Xeon chips for servers typically sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each."
2012-09-20,0,"The companies are in talks for Intel to invest more than 30 billion yen ($383 million) in Sharp, possibly making it Sharp’s top shareholder, Japan’s Mainichi newspaper reported on Friday, without citing sources. They could reach a deal as early as next month, although Sharp will also continue its capital tie-up discussions with Hon Hai, the paper added. Intel is attracted by Sharp’s technology for small and midsize liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, the report said. ($1 = 78.2450 Japanese yen) "
2014-10-14,-1,"Intel said in a statement on Tuesday that demand for its chips was in good shape. “The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycles,” Intel said. The recovering PC industry has helped push Intel’s shares 24 percent higher in 2014, making it the top performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. “The telling thing will be next year. Do we continue to get a healthier, more stable PC market?,” said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. “I think the enterprise refresh largely plays out by the end of 2014 and then next year the PC industry returns to modest annual declines.”  Tuesday’s results, the first from a major technology company this earnings season, came after Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip (MCHP.O) warned last Thursday of weak demand in China that would soon become visible across the chip industry, sparking a broad selloff in chip stocks. Intel said its gross margins would likely slip to 64 percent in the current quarter from 65 percent in the third quarter. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and has been spending heavily to catch up to Qualcomm (QCOM.O).  For the third quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion on revenue of $1 million, reflecting subsidies Intel has been paying to persuade tablet makers to use its chips. Intel posted third-quarter net income of $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as demand for personal computers stabilized. Analysts on average expected EPS of 65 cents. Third-quarter revenue was $14.6 billion, up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.  Analysts on average expected third-quarter revenue of $14.44 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $14.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel were up 2.05 percent in extended trade after closing up 2.13 percent at $32.14 on Nasdaq. "
2014-09-26,10,"The U.S. semiconductor company, more known for chips used in personal computers, has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market. The landmark deal would give Intel a greater foothold in the Chinese mobile chip market, which has become a nexus of the global smartphone industry. Conversely, the deal would provide two Chinese chipmakers support from a U.S. semiconductor giant on chip design and development, an area deemed to be of vital strategic importance by the government in Beijing. “It has become a national priority of China to grow its semiconductor industry,” said Tsinghua Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo in a statement released by Intel on Friday. “The strategic collaboration between Tsinghua Unigroup and Intel ranges from design and development to marketing and equity investments, which demonstrate Intel’s confidence in the Chinese market and strong commitment to Chinese semiconductor industry.” Speculation of the deal has been rife in the Chinese press for several weeks. The announcement confirmed a report by Reuters earlier Friday. Intel’s stake will be via a newly created holding company that owns the units Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics, Unigroup said, adding that the deal is still waiting for government approval. Unigroup is controlled by the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. The institution counts China’s President Xi Jinping as one of its alumni. The government in Beijing has said in published policy papers that it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically. INTEL‘S NEW CEO Since Brian Krzanich took the helm last year, Intel has pursued an array of deals and strategies to ensure its chip technology gets into more smartphones and tablets. The newest investment comes less than six months after Intel reached an agreement with Chinese chip maker Rockchip to make inexpensive tablet chips with Intel’s architecture and branding. The CEO has also opened the chipmaker’s prized, cutting-edge factories to paying customers. More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group FOSL.O and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing. “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, before the announcement. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.” While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilization of demand for personal computers. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus to China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Spreadtrum is one of several chipmakers that specialize in turnkey smartphone platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. "
2013-11-22,-6,"Investors wanted the company at the vanguard of personal-computer technology to lay out a plan to get higher-margin chips into tablets and smartphones, which are rapidly eroding sales of traditional PCs. Executives on Thursday acknowledged that they had understimated the impact of the mobile revolution, and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich outlined plans to begin manufacturing semiconductors for other companies and develop microchips for cheaper tablets. But some analysts warn the latter was a margin-eroding move, arguing Intel still had no technology to dominate next-generation smartphones that run on 4G LTE standards. ”There was a lack of real, confidence-inspiring color on mobility,“ said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. ”It is about bringing something different to the table in mobility that can sustain their gross margin structure. “That’s what we didn’t get from the analysts’ day, to really convince us that they’re going to get back to growth.” On Thursday, Intel projected flat revenue and gross margins for 2014 - slightly below market projections for about 2 percent growth in sales. While analysts said the new CEO may be setting a low bar, others saw that as highlighting an uncertain 2014 and the difficulty of expanding margins as the PC market continues to shrink. The “2014 guidance gave investors their first hints of the potholes in store on the journey,” Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon wrote on Friday. “Intel is trying to buy their way into the tablet market at great near-term cost, and outlook for flat revenue, gross margins ... was disappointing.” Intel stock was down 4.8 percent at $24.02 at midday.

2012-09-07,-8,"Wall Street is reassessing its outlook for the top chipmaker after Hewlett-Packard Co and Inc warned last month of weak demand for PCs. At least eight analysts have reduced their revenue estimates for the dominant PC chipmaker since August 23, pointing to poor economies in Europe, the United States and China, as well as the growing popularity of mobile gadgets. “The risk of a (negative) preannouncement is extremely high at this point,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “I think the supply chain is reeling at the elevated levels of inventory out there.” The top chipmaker is banking on Microsoft Corp’s  much anticipated launch of its Windows 8 platform in October to help slow the growing numbers of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. But in a further sign of growing investor caution, the ratio of put options for Intel shares to call options has risen close to highs not seen since 2006, said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners. Fears of slowing global PC shipments have helped push Intel’s shares down about 11 percent since the end of April. At the forum, Intel’s next-generation PC processor, codenamed Haswell, will be front and center, with executives talking up improved power performance letting future laptops stay on longer without needing a recharge. Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to slash electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel. Intel is also expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the Santa Clara, California company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. The combined market for PCs, smartphones and tablets is expected to almost double over the next four years, but Intel’s share of the processors used in them will dip from 35 percent to 29 percent, according to a report this week from IHS iSuppli. Underscoring mobile gadgets’ heft in the tech industry, Apple on Wednesday will become a distraction for participants at Intel’s forum when it holds a nearby event where it is expected to launch its newest iPhone. Previous versions of Windows worked only with “x86” chips made by Intel and smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices. “The issue is, can we have x86- and ARM-based systems? That’s still a question mark,” Rakesh said. “And then, what is the pricing of these systems versus the iPads and Kindles and other tablets that are out there?” Intel’s new Medfield processor, showcased in phones launched this year in Russia, India and the United Kingdom, surprised some critics who believed the chips would consume too much power. Motorola Mobility, owned by Google Inc, is expected to unveil an Intel-based smartphone in London on September 18, the first of a multi-device agreement with the chipmaker. “They have a respectable seat at the (mobile) table because they surprised a lot of people with Medfield and just how well that did perform,” said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Their big chance to get more credibility will come with Motorola.”"

The impact of Intel favoring equipment built by ASML would not be immediate, but could begin to show up in results as the next generation of etching equipment is introduced over the next couple of years, an analyst told Reuters, on condition he was not identified. Chipmaking equipment accounts for around one-tenth of sales at the Japanese company, which is better known for its cameras. Rival camera maker Canon (7751.T) also makes steppers, although they account for a much smaller proportion of its business. Canon shares rose 0.8 percent in morning trade. "

The message is then sent to the recipient, who can play it, complete with the avatar’s head movements, smiles and blinks.  In an interview, Bell described the app, which is free on Android smartphones and iPhones, as a way to demonstrate facial tracking technology that could appear on future Intel platforms such as laptops or tablets. “Rather than let it sit in a lab and languish, we thought ‘wouldn’t it be cool to show people,'” Bell said of the technology. “It’s fun and easy to explain what it does, but it’s actually pretty complex behind the scenes.” Intel’s core market, the PC industry, is languishing and the chipmaker is far behind rivals such as Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm in mobile chips. "
2014-05-14,-6,"Marketing vice presidents Kevin Sellers and Nancy Bhagat, who would have reported to Fund, are also leaving the chipmaker, the two sources said. The reductions come as the world’s largest chipmaker struggles to revitalize a brand associated with a crumbling PC market. CEO Brian Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion in February that Intel needed to revamp its marketing to get back some of its “coolness.” Morale among many on the marketing team is at an “all-time low” and contributed to some employees’ decisions to leave, one of the sources told Reuters. The chipmaker’s marketing department has struggled over the past year or two to captivate consumers with new ultrathin laptops and two-in-one tablets. “We all know there’s a problem. If you look at the Interbrand numbers you can see it,” said a third person familiar with Intel’s marketing department. “It was smart to go external, bring in someone with fresh thinking.” Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined to confirm how many people had left, but he said they fall within a previously announced plan to trim the chipmaker’s workforce by 5 percent this year. But he said they were not leaving as a reaction to specific problems in the marketing department. Intel’s marketing department had more than 300 employees spread around different business units and offices prior to the cuts, one of the sources estimated. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. But Intel’s brand has lost a little of its glitter in recent years. In 2013, Intel was No. 9 on consulting firm Interbrand’s global ranking, down from No. 7 in 2011. Marketing employees have been split over Krzanich’s decision to hire a new marketing chief from outside the company, unusual for the culturally insular chipmaker. Fund has helped build brands at Procter & Gamble and at Pepsi-Cola. Some Intel staff questioned his lack of technology experience while others at the company said they looked forward to working with him. "
2013-02-25,-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has agreed to make chips on behalf of Altera, a significant step toward opening its prized manufacturing technology to customers on a larger scale, potentially including Apple . Sharing its manufacturing plants, or fabs, to strategic customers could help the world’s top chipmaker offset the growing costs of developing new technology and help keep the plants running near capacity as Intel’s traditional PC business loses steam. Intel will make Altera’s programmable chips using its upcoming 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology, the most notable agreement of its kind announced so far by the chipmaker. “It’s a step in terms of building into a business level we wish to achieve,” Sunit Rikhi, Vice President and General Manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters on Monday. “There’s no doubt in my mind the foundry will be a significant player in the future.” Building new generations of chip manufacturing plants is becoming more and more expensive, and Intel has said in the past it was willing to open its facilities to carefully selected customers - as long as doing so does not its help competitors. Intel has announced agreements to manufacture on behalf of Achronix Semiconductor Corp and other small chipmakers but Monday’s announcement with Altera, one of two leading programmable chipmakers, is potentially much larger. “They’ve crossed over the line from it just being a questionable experiment to - we’re going to do this for tier-1 customers,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. With Intel struggling to find its footing in smarpthones and tablets with its own processor designs, some investors believe Intel may eventually agree to make Apple’s processors for the iPhone and iPad. “If and when we are called upon to serve large mobile customers who can drive a lot more volume, we could serve them today in terms of capability,” Rikhi said. “I‘m confident we have a very strong platform of offering upon which we can scale.” He declined to discuss Apple specifically. Intel has kept its own fabs and invested heavily in them over decades, resulting in a lead in manufacturing know-how that allows it to make chips that in some respects are more advanced than products from rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Altera Chief Executive John Daane told Reuters in a phone interview that Altera, which depends on communications infrastructure for about half of its business, is the only major programmable chipmaker that will have access to Intel’s plants. “We are essentially getting access like an extra division of Intel. As soon as they’re making the technology available to their various groups to do design work, we’re getting the same,” he said. Daane said Intel’s manufacturing technology will give Altera’s chips a several-year advantage against Xilinx, its main competitor in programmable chips. He said Altera would continue to make other chips with TSMC, its long-time foundry. Shares of Altera were unchanged in extended trading after closing down 0.96 percent at $35.01. Xilinx was down about 0.9 percent at $37, versus a close of $37.30 on the Nasdaq. Intel’s stock was up 0.49 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.93 percent at $20.23."

2013-11-20,-6,"By Noel Randewich, Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker Nov 20 (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project said Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer, as first reported by the AllThingsD website. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc,  Amazon.com Inc  Google Inc Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in Feburary 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something  that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC  , CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc  and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.”   (Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco, Ron Grover in Los Angeles and Liana B.

2016-05-26,-1,"Regeneron’s two top executives competed in the annual event during the 1970s and went on to build one of the world’s biggest biotech companies, with cutting-edge drugs for fighting macular degeneration, cancer and cholesterol. The fast-growing biotech company will take over as named sponsor from Intel, whose chips were helping build the personal computer industry in 1998 when it took over as sponsor from Westinghouse. That storied electronics and industrial giant had sponsored the talent search from 1942 to 1997. The competition, overseen by the nonprofit Society for Science & the Public, receives applications annually from more than 1,800 high school seniors, along with their original research in all areas of science, including mathematics.  The field is winnowed to 300 young scientists, among whom 40 become finalists for a competition in Washington, D.C. Regeneron Chief Executive Len Schleifer competed in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search in 1970 with a project on Euclidian geometry. Company research chief George Yancopoulos was a top winner in 1976 for research that involved cutting protozoans in half to see what factors enabled the tiny organisms to regenerate. The young scholars stuck to the regeneration theme when Schleifer started Regeneron in 1988, with Yancopoulos its founding scientist. The company focused on discovering nerve-growth proteins that could regenerate neurons. They hoped to find cures for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Those lofty efforts failed, but the company kept the Regeneron name as it changed course and focused on other diseases. A teacher at Forest Hills High School, in Queens, New York, encouraged Schleifer to enter the Westinghouse competition and gave him inspiration that has lasted a lifetime. “It taught me the value of having a teacher who really cared and served as my mentor,” said Schleifer. He expressed concern that many fine young scientific minds have been lost over recent decades to more-glamorous fields like investment banking, but said the Regeneron Science Talent Search will hopefully keep many others on track. Intel in March said its sponsorship would be ending but provided no details. Company executives declined further comment on Wednesday, including whether the discontinued sponsorship was related to austerity moves as Intel moves forward with 12,000 planned job cuts globally. "
2013-01-18,0,"The top chipmaker’s shares slumped nearly 7 percent on Friday, a day after executives said the company would increase 2013 capital spending from an already dizzying $11 billion. Some analysts decried the move, saying adding new capacity should be far from Intel’s mind in a waning personal computer market. Increased spending may further pressure margins and leave Intel with even more idle capacity if PC sales keep falling. But others believe that Intel’s top priority must be maintaining its technological edge, a costly but necessary endeavor that may even pay off in the long run with market share gains. Moving up the technology ladder can also deliver cost savings, helping safeguarding Intel’s margins as it tries to catch up to rivals in smartphones and tablets. “That’s the bet they’re making and they’re all in,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “If you stop, TSMC  and Samsung close the gap - and you’re toast.” Of Intel’s $13 billion capex this year, $2 billion will go toward expanding a fabrication plant, or fab, in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 mm - about the size of a large pizza. The other $11 billion goes toward more immediate improvements in Intel’s manufacturing technology, letting it  build chips over the next two or three years with features measuring just 14 nanometers, and then 10 nm. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. The newest fabs currently use 300 mm wafers, about the size of a vinyl record. Moving up in size will make room for more than twice as many chips to be etched on each, leading to cost savings. Lowering costs will be a serious priority for Intel as it ventures into the tablet and phone markets, where chips sell for much less than in the PC industry. Intel, which has yet to make meaningful progress in mobile, stresses that its most advanced fabs have the lowest cost per chip produced. “One of reasons why Intel is so aggressive on capital spending is to maximize the chances it has of protecting its gross margins as it moves into smaller and lower priced CPUs,” Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney said. Investors in the past have criticized Amazon.com Inc  for splurging on costly warehouses and other shipping facilities, investments that eventually paid off and contributed to rich stock valuations. While the size of Intel’s capex increase alarmed investors, the chipmaker since 2011 has been spending heavily. Intel normally pours 12 to 16 percent of its revenue into capex, but spending has been closer to 20 percent in the past two years and will probably be higher this year, Feeney estimated. The costs of developing the new technology to use 450 mm fabs are so high that just a few companies, such as Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan’s TSMC, are expected to have the scale to make the jump worthwhile. Building 450 mm plants from the ground up is expected to cost $10 billion or more. It’s not just a matter of creating bigger silicon wafers. Most of the high-tech equipment - sold by the likes of Applied Materials - used in chip manufacturing has to be redesigned as well. The transition from 300 mm to 450 mm is so expensive and complicated that the world’s biggest chipmakers and tool makers are collaborating to establish new standards and timing new technology. Intel made a $3 billion strategic equity investment last year in chip equipment supplier ASML to help fund the development of future lithography tools for 450 mm fabs, a move followed by rivals Samsung and TSMC. Intel’s Oregon plant will lead the effort to produce chips on 450 mm wafers, with other larger Intel plants upgraded in the future, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters on Thursday. Rasgon said Intel’s long-term investments in manufacturing will mean more pressure on its margins over the next few years, but that its spending will help ensure it remains a major player in the chip industry over the next decade - though there’s no guarantee. “If there’s any company I can look at five years from now, they’ll be here and they’ll be really successful at whatever they’re doing. But I don’t know what they’ll look like,” Rasgon said. “They have to do this, but it doesn’t mean I want to own the stock while they’re doing it.”"

2014-09-22,0,"TEL AVIV, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Israel’s finance and economy ministries on Monday approved a plan by Intel Corp to invest $6 billion in the upgrade of its chip manufacturing plant, in what would be the largest single investment by a foreign company in the country. Intel will receive a government grant of $300 million over five years and will be eligible to pay a corporate tax rate of only 5 percent for a 10-year period, the ministries said. The U.S. chip giant plans to hire close to 1,000 more workers at the plant in the southern town of Kiryat Gat by 2023, in addition to the 2,500 that already work there. “Intel’s investment is a strategic asset for Israel’s industry,” Finance Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement. “This is the biggest investment by a foreign company ever in Israel and is further proof that Israel is at the forefront of technology and innovation.” Intel submitted the investment plan in May and it is widely believed to be aimed at shifting to new 10 nanometer technology. The finance ministry said the plant would be the most advanced chip facility in the world. A company spokesman declined to comment. Intel had said January that it would decide on the location of a 10 nanometer plant this year. Israel was one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant. Intel Israel’s exports, mainly from its Fab 28 plant in Kiryat Gat, amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centres and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people in the Jewish state.

2013-06-28,8,"“We believe we have a great user interface and the compression-decompression technology is fantastic,” Krzanich said. “But in the end, if we want to provide that service it comes down to content. We are not big content players.” In their first sit-down with reporters since their promotions in May, Krzanich and Intel President Renee James said wearable computing devices would become a key battleground for mobile industry players. Krzanich, who mentioned he had Google’s Glass wearable device in his knapsack, said computing in the next few years would focus more on items for eyes and ears, as well as wristbands and watches. “I think you’ll start to see stuff with our silicon toward the end of the year and the beginning of next year,” Krzanich said. “We’re trying to get our silicon into some of them, create some ourselves, understand the usage and create an ecosystem.” The world’s biggest chipmaker dominates the PC industry, but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Intel is anxious to make sure it does not fall behind in future technology trends. Krzanich and James said that under their leadership, Intel will give much more priority to its Atom mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. “We see that Atom is now at the same importance, it’s launching on the same leading edge technology, sometimes even coming before Core (Intel’s line of PC chips),” said Krzanich. “We are in the process of looking at all of our roadmaps and evaluating the timing of some of those products. It’s fair to say there are things we would like to accelerate.” Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other smartphone manufacturers favor processors designed with architecture licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc, a trend Intel would like to reverse. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s iPhone chips. “If there was a great customer that we had a great relationship with laptops and other mobile devices, and they said look, we’d really love you to build our ARM-based product, we’d consider it. It depends on how strategic they are,” Krzanich said. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, said he changes laptops and smartphones about once a month to try new ones out. He is currently using a Samsung Galaxy phone and a Lenovo Helix laptop with a detachable keyboard. Under previous CEO Paul Otellini, Intel embarked on a plan to launch an Internet television service with live and on-demand content, entering a hotly competitive race outside its core chip business. While Intel has said it expects to launch its service later this year, as of earlier this month it had not yet finalized programming deals with major content companies. It faces competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, as well as traditional cable companies. “We’re being cautious. We’re experts in silicon, we’re experts in mobility, in driving Moore’s law,” Krzanich said. “But we are not experts in the content industry and we’re being careful.” Processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O>, Samsung and Nvidia Corp account for most of the mobile market. But Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. Samsung has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time. And last month, the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption that some experts believe might help it compete better against Qualcomm.

2014-04-08,-7,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel, struggling with a shrinking personal computer market, is shutting its assembly and test operation in Costa Rica and eliminating 1,500 jobs, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The closure of the site, which is a significant contributor to Costa Rica’s exports, falls within a larger plan announced by the chipmaker earlier this year to cut spending as it attempts to grow beyond PCs into the mobile market. “It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Costa Rica President Elect Luis Guillermo Solis met with Intel executives on Tuesday morning and they assured him the decision had nothing to do with the election of his new government on Sunday, according to a statement from Guillermo’s office. “The decision bears no relation to the election of the new Costa Rica government or the market conditions for...potential foreign investment,” the statement said. Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers, finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. Shares of Intel closed 1.60 percent higher at $26.91 on Nasdaq.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler, Diane Craft and Ken Wills)"
2013-11-20,-9,"The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project said Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer, as first reported by the AllThingsD website. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc Google Inc Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in February 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC, CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.” "
2012-11-21,2,"Intel came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, insisting that emerging markets would prop up growth while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand, and orchestrating a push on “Ultrabook” laptops that have so far failed to excite consumers. A future leader not steeped in Intel’s insular culture could potentially open the chipmaker’s prized factories for the first time to outside customers like Apple Inc or pursue other new strategies to expand into tablets and smartphones, said analyst Nathan Brookwood of Insight 64, a consulting firm. But any investor hoping Intel will hire an outsider with a dramatic solution to the top chipmaker’s PC plight may be out of luck, experts say. While the idea of an iconic visionary like Steve Jobs stepping in to lift Intel into the mobile market - its Achilles heel - may sound attractive, it could open the chipmaker to new risks should it waver from its traditional focus on hard-core manufacturing. Gurus with the experience to run a company with $53 billion a year in sales, a $10 billion capital spending budget and cutting-edge chip manufacturing plants are few and far between - and even rarer outside of Intel, which is struggling with falling PC sales and meager progress in mobile computing. “If you bring someone in who hasn’t run chip companies it’s going to be very difficult because Intel is somewhat unique,” said Patrick Henry, CEO of Entropic Communications, which makes chips for home entertainment. “It would probably surprise me if they didn’t hire one of the internal guys.” Silicon Valley peer Hewlett-Packard Co exemplifies the risks of a poorly thought-out external hire, recruiters and analysts say. During his tumultuous 11-month tenure, former software CEO Leo Apotheker engineered the widely panned $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, which HP accused this week of accounting wrongdoing enroute to swallowing an $8.8 billion charge. [ID:nL4N0902ZH] He also presided over several quarters of lackluster financial results. “I don’t think (Intel) needs a 180-degree transformation. You don’t want somebody like a Leo Apotheker coming on and being your complete undoing,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “Because of how badly things have gone for HP, the most probable scenario for (Intel) at the end of all this in May is that it looks very much the same.” But Mel Connet, a tech industry executive recruiter at Heritage Search Partners in Menlo Park, California, said Intel’s culture needs a shakeup that justifies looking for an outside candidate, while being mindful of the HP example. “My only advice would be not to use the same search firm that HP used,” said Connet, whose firm has not been contracted by Intel for its search. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith is well known by financial analysts and many favor him, believing he is the best bet for keeping Intel stable. The company’s other executive vice presidents are Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani; and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile. They are well respected but are mentioned less often as potential picks. Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said a CEO hired from the ranks would have instant credibility among the company’s tight-knit workforce, which includes over 4,000 PhDs. “There’s no silver bullet. The issue here is not any sort of miss-execution on their part,” said Rasgon. “Their market is changing beneath their feet.” Otellini’s decision to retire, announced Monday, caught the board unprepared to replace him, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy has said. All of Intel’s previous CEO successions were planned long in advance, leaving no room for instability. While Intel said it would include external candidates in its search for a new CEO, it also announced the promotion of Krzanich, Smith and James to executive vice presidents, suggesting that they remain serious potential candidates. Mulloy has said Intel veterans will have a natural advantage in winning the CEO position because they are familiar with the company’s manufacturing-intensive business model and insular, engineering culture. Its cutting-edge fabrication plants are the envy of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), and helped it cement its leadership over decades. But more recently, Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, and Wall Street increasingly worries the chipmaker may be left behind in the fast-growing mobile market. It has pinned its mobile hopes on its superior manufacturing technology, but that strategy has yet to pay off. To date Intel’s market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc and Samsung. Since all but a handful of U.S. chipmakers have shuttered their fabrication plants in the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running advanced plants that cost nearly $10 billion each to build. “The perfect choice, which I don’t think exists right now, is somebody who can manage massive fabs - and also mobility. They don’t exist outside of Samsung, and that’s just not going to happen. There’s a culture clash,” said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy. Insight 64’s Brookwood believes a “Lou Gerstner-type” of executive with a fresh approach could shake up Intel but said such a candidate need not come from outside. Gerstner left RJR Nabisco to run International Business Machines Corp in 1993 and is widely seen as saving the struggling technology giant by focusing on IT services instead of products, in a radical shift. Intel believes its manufacturing strength is its key to succeeding in mobile computing, even if it takes a while for that strategy to pay off. Gauna said Intel’s future CEO should stick to that strategy, although it would be good for that person to have better ties to the mobile world as well as software companies seen as vital for tablets and smartphones. For example, Intel-based smartphones running the Android platform debuted just this year but could have been launched sooner had Otellini been more aggressive, Gauna said. “How they weave in the software strategy and the partnerships within the software and (manufacturing customer) marketplace - that’s where it gets really interesting,” Gauna said. “If I could paint a picture of what it needs to look like I’d put my hat in the ring myself.” "
2014-07-16,0,"The broker actions came after Intel forecast on Tuesday third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate.  Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters that PC sales had stabilized, easing fears about the four-year decline in computer sales as consumers turn increasingly to tablets and smartphones. Intel also raised its share buyback program by $20 billion. “The company is showing clear growth in its PC segment and acceleration in data center growth, suggesting, we think, better growth potential in Intel’s end markets than many investors expect,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note.  Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso, however, said it would be tough to sustain the near-term strength in PC and data center demand. He maintained his “neutral” rating on the stock. Of the 46 analysts covering Intel, 18 have a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock, while 23 have a “hold” or equivalent rating.  Intel’s shares were up 6.5 percent at $33.78 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The stock has gained more than 32 percent in the 12 months to Tuesday’s close. "
2013-02-25,0,"Intel says its latest processor for mainstream smartphones, dubbed Clover Trail+, delivers up to double the computing performance and three times the graphics horsepower of its first smartphone chip, which was used last year in devices sold in Europe, Africa, China and India. Intel dominates the PC industry but shipments have been falling due to the growing popularity of smarpthones and tablets - markets the chipmaker underestimated. The company has been rushing to catch up with Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung, which design chips with technology licensed from ARM Holdings. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker has made progress improving the power-efficiency and computing power of its mobile processors. The Clover Trail+ chips, built with two cores and launched ahead of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday, have been chosen by Lenovo to power an upcoming smartphone for China, Intel said in a press release. Intel’s single-core Medfield smartphone processor was launched last year and have been used in 10 handsets across 20 countries, although the company’s global market share in smartphone chips remains below 1 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. After delays, Intel expects in the next few months to start shipping phone chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S3. Intel-powered phones with LTE, which allows for faster downloads of movies, songs and other content, could appear in stores next year. CEO Paul Otellini has often described Intel’s strategy for expanding into mobile as “a marathon, not a sprint”, but the cut-throat market for smartphone chips increasingly appears to be a three-man race between Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm. Samsung and Apple together accounted for 51 percent of the smartphone market in the December quarter, compared to 46 percent in the same period the year before, according to IDC. Samsung manufactures processors for the iPhone and iPad on behalf of Apple and also increasingly makes its own smartphone chips. Top mobile chipmaker Qualcomm’s stock market value overtook Intel’s for the first time in November. “The issue is the customer environment. Apple and Samsung make their own and the rest of the world has gone Qualcomm,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “They (Intel) need LTE and they need to show that their products aren’t just a little better. They have to be massively better.” In January, Intel announced a new processor platform, codenamed Lexington, targeted at low-priced smartphones in emerging markets like Latin America and Asia where Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung are less dominant and LTE is not a must-have. With Wall Street increasingly worried about slowing PC sales and Intel’s lack of market share in mobile, the chipmaker’s stock has lost a quarter of its value over the past 12 months."
2012-06-08,-7,"* Media heavyweights to work with Intel * Plans call for year-end launch; still no content deals By Yinka Adegoke and Noel Randewich NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, June 8 (Reuters) - Intel is counting on facial-recognition technology for targeted ads and a team of veteran entertainment dealmakers to win over reluctant media partners for its new virtual television service. But so far it’s proving a challenge to get the service off the ground, thanks to an unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business. According to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising. The set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said. Intel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc.  - is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs. While none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices. “If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. Intel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age. For its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners. “They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks. An Intel representative declined to comment for this story. Chip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted. BEYOND PCs While Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential. According to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smarpthones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers -- which typically also use Intel chips. Intel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. According to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component. The biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners. Intel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license. “Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. To change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney. In addition to Huggers and Ancier, sources said, two other names prominent in TV circles have emerged as consultants for Intel: entertainment lawyer Ken Ziffren and former MTV executive Nicole Browning. Browning, who previously negotiated on the other side of the table for MTV, has been handling some of the talks with partners, sources said. Ziffren built his reputation representing Hollywood talent - he was instrumental in negotiating the deal that returned the “Tonight Show” to Jay Leno. Lesser known is his firm’s work negotiating deals for DirecTV’s video-on-demand service and carriage agreements for pay-TV network Starz. But even that quartet of executives may not be enough to resolve an intractable problem, which is that content companies have little incentive to offer their channels to Intel at a discount and Intel is loathe to pay a premium. “They’d love a better deal but they won’t get one,” said Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin of Intel. “The industry has always worked on volume discounts.” Underscoring the difficulty insurgent tech companies face in securing content, Microsoft in January indefinitely postponed plans for its own online TV subscription service after deciding that licensing costs were too high, according to people familiar with those discussions. And therein lies that dilemma that Intel and other insurgent over-the-top providers must tackle before their big plans can be realized."
2015-07-23,-5,"“The chip deal to end all chip deals,” says Cowen and Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, would give Intel’s smartphone chip making business a much-needed boost. It would also allow Intel to expand its footprint in the key Chinese market. Other suitors for Qualcomm’s chip business, valued at $30 billion-$40 billion, could include a consortium backed by the Chinese government and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that it was weighing a possible separation of its two businesses, a move prompted by activist shareholder Jana Partners, which had a 1.7 percent stake in the company as of March 31. The maker of computing and communication chips for mobile devices has been losing ground to Asian rivals such as MediaTek Inc, whose cheaper versions have given them an edge in the price-conscious Asian market. Longtime customer Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon has added to the company’s woes. A deal with Intel, which has its own foundries, will help Qualcomm cut costs and price its chips more competitively. “... This would catapult Intel into the leadership position and give it diversity away from PCs that it very much needs,” Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Cody Acree said. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. Cowen’s Timothy Arcuri said the business could be worth about $20 per share — less than a third of Qualcomm’s current share price — and Intel could offer $25 per share.     Qualcomm funnels licensing profits into the chip business and a possible split raises questions about the unit’s ability to sustain itself as an independent entity. “... We worry that the loss of its golden goose would seriously harm (the chip unit‘s) ability to dramatically out-spend competitors on research and development,” Arcuri said. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington said Qualcomm was unlikely to go through with the split, but if it did, Intel would be a good fit. “I can’t see how they can possibly segregate the two. Whatever short term gain is derived, would be more than made up with permanent loss of market share in ... two to three years,” he said, adding that Qualcomm could instead look to partner with Intel or smaller Chinese and Korean companies.

2014-04-08,-4,"“It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Costa Rica President Elect Luis Guillermo Solis met with Intel executives on Tuesday morning and they assured him the decision had nothing to do with the election of his new government on Sunday, according to a statement from Guillermo’s office. “The decision bears no relation to the election of the new Costa Rica government or the market conditions for...potential foreign investment,” the statement said. Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers, finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. Shares of Intel closed 1.60 percent higher at $26.91 on Nasdaq. "
2013-06-10,-1,"June 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s talks to buy content from media companies for its new TV service are advancing, and the chipmaker is offering to pay as much as 75 percent more than traditional cable rates, people familiar with the talks said. But Intel has yet to close any programming deals, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. CBS, News Corp and Viacom have reached agreements with Intel on certain details over how their content would be distributed on the service the chipmaker plans to begin later this year, one person familiar with the situation said. Comcast’s NBC Universal is continuing its talks with Intel but its negotiations are not as advanced others companies, said another source familiar with the matter. Intel has moved substantially on subscriber fees it is willing to pay since the negotiations began, one source said. It has also suggested preventing viewers from skipping commercials on the first run of a show, said another source. Representatives for Viacom, NBC, CBS, News Corp, Disney’s ABC and Time Warner declined to comment. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, and therefore has no viewers, it can expect to pay a premium, all the sources said. SNL Kagan, a research firm that measures and publishes the average subscriber fees cable and satellite TV operators pay for television networks, recorded last year’s highest fees were $5.15 per subscriber per month and were charged by Disney’s ESPN. While it was not clear exactly what amounts Intel had originally offered for specific channels, sources said the tech company was basing its 50 to 75 percent premium on listed average SNL Kagan subscriber fees. Intel needs deals with the top five or six U.S. media companies to secure most of the popular TV channels, according to one source. Intel said in February that it planned to compete with Apple , Amazon and Google and provide a set-top box and service that would offer live and on-demand programming. Erik Huggers, the head of Intel Media, has said he plans to offer customers smaller bundles of content than those currently being offered by cable and satellite operators. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Huggers has billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Higher prices for consumers would give Intel breathing room to pay more to media companies without sacrificing its own margins. Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said the chipmaker still plans to launch its TV service this year, but declined to give details of negotiations with media companies. Having missed the mobile revolution and fallen behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel senior executives are eager to be on the leading edge of future consumer technologies. Intel sees the living room as a potential battleground, where its advanced chips, used in set-top boxes and to power “cloud” data centers, can give it an advantage and help set the standard for other home entertainment products."
2016-05-26,-1,"Regeneron’s two top executives competed in the annual event during the 1970s and went on to build one of the world’s biggest biotech companies, with cutting-edge drugs for fighting macular degeneration, cancer and cholesterol. The fast-growing biotech company will take over as named sponsor from Intel, whose chips were helping build the personal computer industry in 1998 when it took over as sponsor from Westinghouse. That storied electronics and industrial giant had sponsored the talent search from 1942 to 1997. The competition, overseen by the nonprofit Society for Science & the Public, receives applications annually from more than 1,800 high school seniors, along with their original research in all areas of science, including mathematics.  The field is winnowed to 300 young scientists, among whom 40 become finalists for a competition in Washington, D.C. Regeneron Chief Executive Len Schleifer competed in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search in 1970 with a project on Euclidian geometry. Company research chief George Yancopoulos was a top winner in 1976 for research that involved cutting protozoans in half to see what factors enabled the tiny organisms to regenerate. The young scholars stuck to the regeneration theme when Schleifer started Regeneron in 1988, with Yancopoulos its founding scientist. The company focused on discovering nerve-growth proteins that could regenerate neurons. They hoped to find cures for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Those lofty efforts failed, but the company kept the Regeneron name as it changed course and focused on other diseases. A teacher at Forest Hills High School, in Queens, New York, encouraged Schleifer to enter the Westinghouse competition and gave him inspiration that has lasted a lifetime. “It taught me the value of having a teacher who really cared and served as my mentor,” said Schleifer. He expressed concern that many fine young scientific minds have been lost over recent decades to more-glamorous fields like investment banking, but said the Regeneron Science Talent Search will hopefully keep many others on track. Intel in March said its sponsorship would be ending but provided no details. Company executives declined further comment on Wednesday, including whether the discontinued sponsorship was related to austerity moves as Intel moves forward with 12,000 planned job cuts globally. "
2014-02-18,-2,"With Intel’s core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming increasingly important. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, told reporters on Tuesday the new Xeon chip is aimed at customers like retailers, airlines, stock exchanges and credit card companies keen to instantly crunch growing troves of data. The new Xeon chip is twice as efficient as its previous generation and allows more data to be held in memory instead of on hard drives so that it can be quickly analyzed. “The Xeon E7 v2 will give a highly anticipated boost to enterprise IT, giving them the ability to deploy new capabilities that were previously impossible,” Bryant said. In the quarter ended in December, the Data Center Group’s sales grew 7 percent, below the company’s expectations due to slow spending by enterprise, a category that includes corporations and governments. However, demand from Web-based companies was robust. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said in January that weak demand from enterprise customers meant the Data Center Group’s revenues this year would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. While Intel’s laptop and desktop chips typically sell for prices in the low hundreds of dollars, its top-of-the-line server processors may sell for thousands of dollars each, boosting the company’s profit margins. Bryant said the new Xeon server chips will make it easier for credit card companies to instantly analyze past transactions and send useful data to retailers looking to sell products to customers in their stores. As another example of a growing field known as Big Data, Bryant said airlines have begun to use predictive analytics to head off unscheduled maintenance needs and reduce the number of flight cancellations."
2015-06-01,0,"Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera’s close on Friday. Altera’s shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading. That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies. Intel’s shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86. The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It seems very high to me,” Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. “The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn’t turn out very well for Broadcom.” The deal price is unchanged from Intel’s unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April. The integration of Altera’s chips with Intel’s will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “That’s the piece that’s pretty exciting about it,” he said. Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said. The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry’s biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp BRCM.O for $37 billion. NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N for $12 billion. It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company’s mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers. Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner. Net revenue from Intel’s PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue. The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks. Up to Friday’s close, Altera’s shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel’s shares rose 14.6 percent. J.P.

2015-06-09,2,"The move comes as technology companies face heavy criticism for their overwhelmingly male and white workforces, which some argue creates a climate that discourages women and minorities from aspiring to work in technology or sticking around if they start there. Increased diversity would lead to stronger, more innovative companies, the thinking goes. The fund, spearheaded by Lisa Lambert, an African-American and a managing director at Intel Capital, is leading by example. She and her team have already spent $16.7 million on an initial four investments, including one company led by a woman. Brit Morin’s Brit & Co, an online San Francisco-based retailer sells do-it-yourself kits and tutorials. Like all the companies backed by the fund, Brit & Co fits into Intel’s broader strategy, in this case, advancing technologies such as Intel’s Galileo development board. Brit & Co is promoting the board, essentially a circuit board with an Intel chip, as a tool its “maker” community can use on projects. “We’re not doing this purely because they represent diverse teams,” Lambert said about the companies in an interview. “They’re integral to Intel’s core investments.” By funneling some diversity money through venture capital, Intel reasons it can nurture a group of role models that in turn will encourage more minorities and women to aspire to work in technology startups. That will benefit both Intel and the broader economy. The fund also led an investment in CareCloud, a Miami-based healthcare provider where the diversity quotient is less obvious given the sea of white male faces that appear on the management section of the company’s website.  But women and Hispanics comprise more than half CareCloud’s workforce, Lambert said, including founder and chief strategy officer Albert Santalo. Rounding out the group are Mark One, a San Francisco-based company peddling cups that use Intel technology to automatically evaluate the calories and nutritional content of beverages poured into them, and Venafi, a Salt Lake City-based cybersecurity company. Three African-Americans sit on the executive staff of Mark One, Lambert said, while three senior women, including the chief information officer, serve at Venafi. Intel’s U.S. workforce comprises 51,118 employees, of which 24 percent are women, 31 percent are Asian, 8 percent are Hispanic or Latino, and 4 percent are African American. "
2014-03-31,1,"In the release, Cloudera announced the completion of a $900 million round of funding, which it said includes Intel’s previously undisclosed stake and another $160 million that was announced earlier in March from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and others. Intel said last Thursday it had made a “significant” investment in Cloudera and that it would make the fast-growing startup its preferred distributor of “Hadoop” data management software. Like rivals HortonWorks and Pivotal, Cloudera focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through Hadoop, an open-source software system that can sort and analyze massive amounts of information, increasingly called Big Data, generated through the Internet and mobile devices. As part of the deal, Intel will transition away from its own customized version of Hadoop that it had been promoting as optimal for Intel server chips. The size of Intel’s investment in Cloudera and the end of its own Hadoop customization underscores a willingness by CEO Brian Krzanich to move decisively since taking over a year ago with the personal computer industry in a tailspin. Cloudera is only one of several Silicon Valley startups to receive multibillion-dollar valuations from investors recently, a trend that has some on Wall Street concerned about lofty prices. Last week, Facebook Inc raised eyebrows when it said it would pay $2 billion for Oculus VR, a two-year-old virtual reality startup that has yet to put a product on the market. Intel hopes that encouraging more companies to leap into Big Data analysis will lead to higher sales of its high-end Xeon server processors. The chipmaker believes that hitching its wagon to Cloudera’s version of Hadoop, instead of pushing its own version, will make that happen faster. With Intel’s core PC market shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming a larger component of the company’s profits. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Big Data is a key part of the Internet of Things, a term referring to the increasing connectivity of everyday devices from cars to smoke alarms. Finding ways to analyze and make use of vast amounts of data collected by those smart devices is becoming a major opportunity for IT companies including Intel. The global market for Big Data technology and services is expected to expand at a 27 percent annual rate to $32 billion through 2017, according to market research firm IDC. After falling behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel aims to make sure it is a major player in the Internet of Things by supplying processors used in new devices as well as the server hardware and software used to analyze the data those devices create. Intel’s bet on the success of Cloudera dwarfs its previous investments focused on data center technology. In 2007, Intel invested $218 million in VMWare, giving it a 2.5 percent stake in that data center software maker. "
2014-10-14,0,"Third-quarter revenue was $14.6 billion, up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.

2012-10-14,-6,"But in the fast-growing and cut-throat mobile world, Intel is struggling - its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may become much more ordinary. When the company reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, one key figure to watch is gross margin, which analysts forecast at 62 percent. While that is still the envy of smaller chipmakers, it has been declining from a record 67.5 percent in late 2010, a trend analysts expect to continue. “If we’re moving to mobile, which is a low-margin business, it’s difficult to see where the high-margin business is going to be for Intel,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management. “That’s why we own Qualcomm and we don’t own Intel.” Shares of Intel have fallen about 7 percent over the past year. Qualcomm, a leader in providing “logic chips” or processors for tablets, has gained 12 percent. It is not all gloom for Intel. Its highly profitable server chip business, now almost a quarter of revenue, is growing quickly as Internet companies like Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc build more “cloud” data centers to offer services to consumers using mobile gadgets. Shipments of cloud servers are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 31 percent through 2015, much faster than overall server shipments, according to IHS iSuppli. Pointing to an indirect benefit of mobile computing, Intel estimates that for every 600 new smartphones or 120 new tablets bought by consumers, an additional server is needed. Still, the 44-year-old founding member of the Silicon Valley technology industry is struggling to find its place in a world moving quickly to mobile gadgets and social networks. Analysts say emerging markets and business customers will fuel Intel’s growth for the next several years but not at the explosive rates it has often enjoyed in the past. Intel’s revenue is forecast to be roughly flat this year with 2011 and to grow 4 percent next year, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That compares with 24 percent annual growth in the past two years. Intel was slow to recognize how big a threat tablets would become, with executives describing them as complementary to PCs - a view shared by many others. Increasingly, people are changing their tune. Global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft Windows. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. Intel declined to comment. That shortfall was underscored when Intel warned in September of weak demand and cut its own forecast for third-quarter revenue by more than even the most pessimistic analysts expected. The release of Intel’s new Ivy Bridge processor this year was meant to speed up sales of Ultrabooks. But with premium-features like solid-state drives and touch displays, many models went for $1,000 or more - well above the $600-$700 price tag that analysts say is needed to gain traction with consumers. Pointing to those high prices, IHS iSuppli recently slashed its forecast for 2012 shipments of Ultrabooks from 22 million units to 10.3 million units, with half of those expected in the next three months, coinciding with the launch of Windows 8. “The only way it’s going to work is if the PC world can achieve better economies of scale and get those prices down,” said Longbow Research analyst Joanne Feeney. Determined to protect its profit margins, Intel in the past has suggested it will not reduce chip prices to make Ultrabooks more affordable. Intel’s dominance has long allowed it to charge aggressive prices for its processors - unlike many competitors, Intel both designs and manufacturers its own chips. But even with that advantage, along with technological improvements and growing economies of scale, Intel may be hard pressed to preserve margins as it moves further into mobile, where processors sell for much less, analysts said. Gross margins on smartphone processors typically work out to 50 percent, according to D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Aalok Shah. “We believe the post-PC era has arrived,” Piper Jaffray analyst Gus Richard wrote in a recent note to investors. “Moreover, $120 Intel CPUs are being replaced by $25 ARM-based CPUs as PCs are being cannibalized by tablets.” Microsoft also plans to launch a tablet/laptop hybrid using Intel’s processors, aimed at corporate customers looking for a device compatible with business software that does not currently run on the iPad or Android tablets. If nothing else, Intel’s depressed share price has made investors like Capital Advisors fund manager Channing Smith take a closer look. “Obviously the stock is extremely cheap and it has a very attractive dividend yield, but there’s a good reason the stock is where it is, and that’s mainly because strategically they’ve really missed out on mobile,” Smith said. "
2015-01-20,3,"But focusing too hard on the pipeline, a frequent tactic of technology firms seeking to change their workforce, will benefit the chipmaker less than working on what happens inside Intel, diversity advocates say. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich surprised a mostly male crowd at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas by unveiling a 2020 goal for Intel to employ more women and minorities. Diversity has become a major corporate issue in the United States as companies look to improve their images and for ways to boost productivity by tapping new groups of potential employees. Intel’s effort is one of the largest to date by cash spent. Silicon Valley has a dismal track record employing those groups, and Intel is no exception: just a quarter of its U.S. employees in 2013 were women and 12 percent were Hispanic or African American, it said. By comparison, about one-third of bachelor degrees granted in computers and math go to women, according to the National Science Foundation. Krzanich described plans for educational initiatives, an area where Intel already spends $100 million annually with an undisclosed but small portion focusing on women and minorities. He also broadly promised to improve hiring and retention. A shortfall of women and minorities receiving technology-oriented education is often seen as the leading barrier to a diverse workforce in Silicon Valley. An opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle said Intel’s plans “hinge on the available talent produced by a limited educational pipeline.” Prominent venture capitalist Paul Graham told online publication the Information last year that the lack of women technology entrepreneurs and programmers was a problem “10 years upstream of us.” Diversity advocates say seizing on the supply issue can obscure other causes. “They are blaming the pipeline for their own faults,” said Vivek Wadhwa, author of “Innovating Women,” noting that many technology companies no longer consider degrees of any sort, including computer science (CS), a requirement for employment. “If male flunkies can join (tech companies), why do women need to have CS degrees?” he asked. “This is an excuse.” He and others say technology companies should look inward, working on making themselves attractive to qualified women and minority candidates who avoid or abandon technology careers. Of all science and engineering graduates, only about 31 percent of males and 15 percent of females work in related occupations, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Just 17 percent of African Americans with science and engineering degrees go on to work in related jobs. To draw women and minorities, Intel should make managers accountable to specific diversity goals and measure progress through employee surveys, said Katherine Kimpel, a lawyer specializing in discrimination at Sanford Heisler Kimpel LLP. Intel CEO Krzanich said he would tie executive compensation to hitting diversity targets. The company also plans to factor diversity into year-end bonuses, a spokeswoman said. Lori Nishiura Mackenzie, executive director of Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, said Intel should spend the bulk of its cash on what she called “the frozen middle” just below the top executives. EBay has a workforce that is 42 percent female, compared with around 30 percent for most technology companies. A spokeswoman said women in leadership positions rose 30 percent annually after eBay launched a gender initiative, including mentorship of five women per senior executive, at the end of 2010. Telle Whitney, chief executive officer of the Anita Borg Institute, which focuses on women and technology, said that the best return on investment is for companies to combat unconscious bias: unintentional discrimination that comes out in words and actions. Many technology companies now offer managers training in this area, including Google Inc and Microsoft Corp . Intel already has unconscious bias training and plans more, the spokeswoman said. Avivah Wittenberg-Cox, who runs a diversity consultancy called 20-First, said Intel should focus on improving diversity in its top three management layers, through steps such as encouraging different departments to compete on goals. Intel President Renee James is female, but the chipmaker has no Hispanics or blacks at its highest levels. Silicon Valley is still seen as a nerdy boys club that is not interested in diversity, Wittenberg-Cox said. “Until that image and mindset changes, the numbers will not follow.”    (Reporting by Noel Randewich and Sarah McBride; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)"
2014-01-07,-10,"“I’ve been begging them to drop the brand or fix the product,” McAfee said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. He did not speculate on a reason for the move, which was not completely unexpected. Last June, McAfee appeared in a profanity-laced video attacking the quality of the software produced by the company, which he founded in the late 1980s. He said he frequently gets emails from customers who complain that it degrades the performance of their computers and is difficult to remove. Intel has repeatedly said the attacks on the quality of its software are “ludicrous” and without merit. Its chief technology officer, Michael Fey, said on Tuesday that the company was not concerned about the video, partly because customers knew that John McAfee had not worked for the company in some 20 years. “Everybody realized the man was trying to get a laugh or make a joke. It is far from something that most buyers took seriously,” he said. “We didn’t really feel much pressure.” Still, he said, it would be a relief to be able to ignore John McAfee’s antics once Intel stopped using his name. “As an employee I am happy to stop having to answer that,” Fey said. Questions about Intel’s plans for keeping the McAfee brand first surfaced in late 2012, when John McAfee, to much publicity, left the Central American nation of Belize after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. He said he was framed for a murder he did not commit. John McAfee fled to the United States in December 2012 and is developing technology dubbed D-Central that he says will help keep Internet communications safe from government snooping. Then in his video attacking the software, the millionaire fires a gun into a computer. He was undressed and pawed by a group of young women. McAfee said he did it all to mock the media’s unfair portrayal of him as unhinged. “I am who I am. I‘m sorry I live on the edge and enjoy life and don’t care what people think of me,” he said on Tuesday, when asked how he felt about Intel dumping his name. “I‘m sorry that the software has my name.” "
2014-01-06,0,"The evolving category is a major theme at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with several companies expected to unveil their own versions of intelligent and connected clothing. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. The company has struggled in past attempts to expand beyond the PC arena. A years-long project to provide consumer TV services was shelved last year with its technology put up for sale and the company’s mobile processors have barely made a dent in the global smartphone market even after major improvements to them. After replacing former CEO Paul Otellini in May, Krzanich, a chip manufacturing and operations guru, created a new division focused on identifying future technology trends and making sure Intel is not caught off-guard again. In his keynote presentation at the technology show, Krzanich introduced some of that group’s early results, including sample gadgets that Intel is promoting to consumer device manufacturers. “We’re looking at a broad ecosystem of wearables, not just the device or the silicon,” he said. Luxury department store Barneys New York is collaborating with Intel to develop smart bracelets that look like they were created by a fashion designer and not by an engineer. At the event, Krzanich also showed off Intel’s take on stereo earbuds for exercise enthusiasts that - as well as playing music - measure the wearer’s heartbeat through their ears. While other companies have launched similar pulse-taking audiophones, Intel’s are powered through a microphone jack that connects to the user’s smartphone, instead of a separate power source. In addition, integrated software can automatically change the music being played in order to encourage the wearer to speed up or slow down their workout depending on their heart rate. Intel also showed off a Bluetooth earpiece and microphone that the chipmaker says improves the responsiveness of personal assistant smartphone software like Apple’s Siri. The gadget features always-on technology that makes it easier to ask questions of the device and also monitors the user’s environment in order to avoid interrupting. “The real key here is seamless, no buttons, always listening, but it still has that low-power capability,” Krzanich said. Krzanich also showed a smartwatch meant for kids with “geo-fencing” capabilities that alert parents if their children stray from established walking routes to and from home or school or don’t arrive on time.

2014-09-25,6,"By Gerry Shih and Noel Randewich BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  is close to announcing an investment in Chinese-government affiliated mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics, its latest move to catch up in a smartphone chip industry led by Qualcomm Inc , according to two sources with knowledge of the plan. It was unclear how much Intel is paying or what portion of the companies the U.S. chipmaker is buying. The acquisition could be made through Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the sources said. Tsinghua Unigroup owns Spreadtrum and RDA. Intel, which has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market, recently has sought to partner with mobile chipmakers in the hope they can help it gain the market dominance it has enjoyed with personal computers. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Tsinghua Unigroup did not respond immediately to a request for comment. This week there have been several reports in China of a potential deal, including one on the sina.com.cn news portal quoting unnamed sources as saying Intel would get 20 percent of Tsinghua Unigroup for $1.5 billion. The Beijing government has said in published policy papers it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically. China is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer and smartphone market. Intel, under Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, has pursued an array of deals and strategies to ensure its chip technology gets  into more smartphones and tablets. The newest investment comes less than six months after Intel reached an agreement with Chinese chip maker Rockchip to make inexpensive tablet chips with Intel’s architecture and branding. Since taking over as Intel’s CEO last year, Krzanich has also opened the chipmaker’s prized, cutting-edge factories to paying customers. More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group  and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing. “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.” While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilization of demand for personal computers. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus to China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Spreadtrum is one of several chipmakers that specialize in “turnkey” smartphone platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. Intel’s shares were down 1.47 percent at $34.24 in late-afternoon, in tandem with U.S. stock markets.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich and Gerry Shih; Editing by Peter Henderson and Steve Orlofsky)"

2012-05-10,-4,"* Talks up ultrabooks, smarpthones * Investors eye languid PC sales * CFO sees gross margins staying high By Noel Randewich SANTA CLARA, California, May 10 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  Chief Executive Paul Otellini said that he was not seeing unexpected weakness in enterprise technology spending that Cisco Systems Inc CEO John Chambers cited when he forecast quarterly earnings below estimates. “This quarter is playing out as we thought. The enterprise is good, it’s not fantastic, so we don’t see a change in that,” Otellini said in answer to a question at Intel’s annual investor day on Thursday. Shares of Cisco, which relies on government and corporate spending on Internet gear, dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, a day after the company released its financial results. “I think John’s comments were focused on Europe in particular. We haven’t seen any change in Europe demand on the enterprise side,” Otellini said. Much of the presentations by Otellini and other Intel executives showcased the chipmaker’s long-awaited push into smartphones as well as ultra-thin laptops. Intel offered little new hope to investors concerned about languid PC sales. Otellini also forecast that Intel, with its deep pockets, would survive as one of a handful of leading-edge chip manufacturers as the sector moves toward larger and costlier factories. With the industry preparing to increase the size of the silicon wafers it uses, letting manufacturers fit more chips on each, future leading-edge factories will cost more than $10 billion each to build, compared with about $5 billion now, Otellini said. Intel, Samsung Electronics and contract manufacturer TSMC will be among the few companies able to build those larger factories and keep them working full time, experts have said. Reflecting higher costs in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, Intel is boosting its capital spending this year to $12.5 billion from about $10.8 billion in 2011. “When you see a capex of ten or twelve billion you say, ‘Oh my god.’ But you forget that our (annual) revenue is approaching $60 billion,” Otellini told an analyst who questioned Intel’s higher spending. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said he expects gross margins next year to remain at the high end of Intel’s recent historical range of 60 percent to 65 percent. Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor, and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Before declaring that Intel is a serious player in the mobile market, many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete have fueled gains in its shares in recent months. Major manufacturers like Asus and Hewlett Packard  are launching ultrabooks, but some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, in charge of the ultrabook push, said the laptops are aimed at prices starting at $700. He said consumers would be willing to spend more than normal on PCs delivering premium features. Demonstrations of future gadgets, including an ultrabook with a touchscreen display, won polite applause. But analysts said they heard little to reduce concerns that Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to make ultrabooks affordable and help drive sales. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for its new Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Global PC shipments in the first quarter grew a tepid 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, according to research firm Gartner. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year."
2015-03-27,-2,"March 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel’s biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector. The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers, the military and other industrial applications, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, the world’s biggest chipmaker has been slower than its rivals to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. Earlier this month, Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast to $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers. Shares of Altera shot up about 28 percent after the talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, closing at $44.39 per share on the Nasdaq. Intel shares also gained on the news, rising 6.4 percent to $32. Shares of Xilinx, Altera’s main rival, closed up 6 percent. “On the surface, Altera is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margins than Intel, and with about two-thirds of its revenue from telecom, wireless, military/aerospace, it definitely fits the bill of diversifying revenue beyond Intel’s legacy computer markets,” said Cowen & Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, in a note to clients. Intel declined to comment on the report. An Altera spokesman also declined to comment. Any deal for Altera, valued at $10.4 billion at Thursday’s close and more than $13 billion after trading ended on Friday, would easily surpass Intel’s previous biggest deal, its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. Altera’s value to Intel is its programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers, where they are customized for specialized functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has already been manufacturing chips on behalf of the smaller company since 2013, a major change for Intel, which traditionally has been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology. Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry. Features such as WiFi or Bluetooth that once required chips sold by separate companies can now be squeezed onto single pieces of silicon. Deals in the chip sector have been expected after NXP Semiconductors’ $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor was announced earlier this month. Worldwide semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data show. In the 12 months through March 2, 472 chip M&A deals were made worldwide, up from 383 in the previous year. Unlike typical semiconductors, programmable chips made by Altera can be customized after they are manufactured to suit different purposes.

2015-07-23,-5,"“The chip deal to end all chip deals,” says Cowen and Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, would give Intel’s smartphone chip making business a much-needed boost. It would also allow Intel to expand its footprint in the key Chinese market. Other suitors for Qualcomm’s chip business, valued at $30 billion-$40 billion, could include a consortium backed by the Chinese government and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). Qualcomm said on Wednesday that it was weighing a possible separation of its two businesses, a move prompted by activist shareholder Jana Partners, which had a 1.7 percent stake in the company as of March 31. The maker of computing and communication chips for mobile devices has been losing ground to Asian rivals such as MediaTek Inc (2454.TW), whose cheaper versions have given them an edge in the price-conscious Asian market. Longtime customer Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon has added to the company’s woes. A deal with Intel, which has its own foundries, will help Qualcomm cut costs and price its chips more competitively. “... This would catapult Intel into the leadership position and give it diversity away from PCs that it very much needs,” Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Cody Acree said. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. Cowen’s Timothy Arcuri said the business could be worth about $20 per share — less than a third of Qualcomm’s current share price — and Intel could offer $25 per share.     Qualcomm funnels licensing profits into the chip business and a possible split raises questions about the unit’s ability to sustain itself as an independent entity. “... We worry that the loss of its golden goose would seriously harm (the chip unit‘s) ability to dramatically out-spend competitors on research and development,” Arcuri said. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington said Qualcomm was unlikely to go through with the split, but if it did, Intel would be a good fit. “I can’t see how they can possibly segregate the two. Whatever short term gain is derived, would be more than made up with permanent loss of market share in ... two to three years,” he said, adding that Qualcomm could instead look to partner with Intel or smaller Chinese and Korean companies.

2016-04-19,-5,"Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits. Intel’s shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Most of Intel's factories are in the United States, although it did not identify where cuts would be focused geographically. It said it would record a pretax restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and expected annual savings of $1.4 billion per year starting mid-2017. (bit.ly/1WDPfBm) The company also said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Intel said it would begin a formal search process for a new CFO. Smith said that Intel now expects the PC market to decline by a percentage in the high single digits in 2016 versus a prior forecast of a mid single-digit decline. Declines in China and other emerging markets are also leading to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. “PC demand, at least in the eyes of Intel, is expected to be weaker than the industry originally anticipated,” said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P Capital Global Market Intelligence. He added that although the industry has already seen some of the weakness experienced by Intel, the company’s comments dashed any hope of recovery. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data center business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market. Intel has also made inroads into the mobile devices market, although competitors Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Samsung Electronics Co(005930.KS) dominate there. Intel said in a statement the job cuts would be carried out by mid-2017 and the restructuring would “accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.” Sales of products for the data center and the Internet of things accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the majority of operating profit, it added. Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann, who rates Intel “under perform” said the problems leading to the job cuts were likely more about Intel than the broader tech industry.  “The bigger issue is the restructuring and will it be enough for the company to properly adapt to a changing environment where cloud and IoT competitive dynamics are quite different,” Mosesmann added. On a per share basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from 41 cents a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion. Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents. Up to Tuesday’s close, Intel’s shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year, compared with a slight gain in the broader semiconductor index .SOX. "
2013-01-07,0,"At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Intel said new energy-efficient processors for tablets and laptops are available now, and it outlined features like voice recognition and drastically improved battery life on future PCs. “Absolutely all-day battery life where you just don’t have to bring your power brick at all anymore,” Kirk Skaugen, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group, said of laptops built with the company’s upcoming Haswell processor. While macroeconomic troubles have weighed on sales for several quarters, the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones is seen as an existential threat to the PC industry. Anxious to breath new life into PCs and prove a recent slump in sales is not permanent, Intel and PC manufactures in Las Vegas this week will display a range of ultra thin laptops, dubbed Ultrabooks, and hybrid devices that convert into tablets. On a stage flanked by dozens of tablets and laptops with rotatable and detachable screens, Skaugen said Intel’s newly available chip based on its current Ivy Bridge architecture sips just 7 watts of energy, more efficient than a previously planned 10 watts of power. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for batttery-powered smartphones and tablets, a fast-growing market led by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , ARM Holdings Plc and others. Mike Bell, who co-heads Intel’s mobile and wireless business, introduced a new processor platform, code named Lexington, targeted at low-priced smartphones in emerging markets like Latin America and Asia. “It’s designed to be a no-excuses multimedia phone,” he said. Acer, Safaricom and Lava have already agreed to use the new chips in future phones, Bell said. A handful of manufacturers and telecom carriers in Europe and Asia have already launched smartphones using Intel’s Medfield processors this year. Google’s Motorola Mobility in September launched the Razr i in Europe and Latin America as the first handset of a multi-device agreement between the two groups. But Intel is fighting an uphill battle in a market where chips made using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. Intel also has yet to release a chip for 4G telephone networks, keeping it out of the running for major smartphone design wins in the United States. Sales of smartphone processors soared 58 percent in the third quarter, but Intel had just 0.2 percent of that market, according to a recent report from Strategy Analytics. By comparison, worldwide PC shipments fell 8.6 percent in the third quarter, according to IDC. Intel said 3D cameras would be integrated in future Ultrabooks to allow consumers to use gestures and facial recognition to control their devices. Upcoming Ultrabooks will also include voice interaction, Skaugen said. “We’re basically going to give the PC the same human senses we’ve all had,” he said. Intel and other tech companies are increasingly looking for ways to let PCs and other devices use cameras, GPS chips, microphones and other kinds of sensors to predict their users’ needs. “It’s this combination of computer devices doing things before you ask them to do it, in that they’re smart enough to know based on their sensors,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy."
2013-10-15,-3,"But preparations for the Broadwell chip, which will succeed Haswell, have fallen behind projections by about three months due to technical setbacks, Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call following Intel’s quarterly report on Tuesday. He said production of the Broadwell chips, based on the 14 nanometer technology that is ahead of rivals’ technology, will not begin until the first quarter. “We and our (manufacturing) partners have a strong desire to get Broadwell to the market,” Krzanich said. “This is a small blip in the schedule.” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the delay would not affect gross margins in the fourth quarter or impact the competitiveness of Intel’s product lineup. “We’re not happy with the one-quarter push but it does point to how difficult these problems are to solve,” he told Reuters. Much of Intel’s strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Broadwell’s delay should have little impact on Intel’s sales, said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, although he added that investors were sensitive to any hint of technology trouble at the chipmaker. “For these guys, their competitive advantage is based on manufacturing. It’s certainly a small setback. You don’t want to screw with timetables, and you don’t want to screw with Moore’s law,” Rolland said. With consumers increasingly favoring tablets and smartphones, Intel is wrestling with a slowdown in its core PC market while trying to make inroads in low-power mobile devices. Adapting to the slow PC industry, Intel also trimmed its 2013 capital expenditure target to $10.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, from $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Since taking the helm in May, Krzanich has pushed to improve Intel’s offering of chips for mobile devices. It recently announced a lineup of ultra-small chips for wearable devices, which are growing more popular. Intel dominates the PC industry but it was slow to adapt its chips for low-power mobile gadgets like smartphones and tablets. Krzanich has promised Intel’s new Bay Trail mobile chip would find its way into a slew of tablets, but it is still unclear how much progress is being made and how much those mobile chips, which sell for less than Intel’s latest PC chips, may affect its gross margins. Some analysts believe the PC industry’s troubles are already baked into the price of Intel’s stock, which has risen about 14 percent in 2013, less than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 20 percent. Intel shares trade at 12 times expected earnings, only slightly less than rival Qualcomm Inc’s at 14 times earnings. The company said its gross margin in the third quarter was 62.4 percent, and it forecast 61 percent for the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected 60.92 percent for the third quarter and 60.98 percent for the fourth quarter. Intel posted net earnings of $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared to $2.97 billion, or 58 cents share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 53 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $13.48 billion, barely changed from $13.46 billion in the year-ago quarter. Intel forecast revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million for the current fourth quarter.

2013-10-15,-2,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  third-quarter results modestly beat expectations on Tuesday, but its current-quarter revenue outlook fell short and it warned that production of its upcoming Broadwell processors was delayed. The world’s top chipmaker is betting that its current Haswell PC processor with improved battery life will boost sales for the rest of 2013, beyond the typically strong third quarter when PC manufacturers buy chips in anticipation of holiday demand. But preparations for the Broadwell chip, which will succeed Haswell, have fallen behind projections by about three months due to technical setbacks, Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call following Intel’s quarterly report on Tuesday.

2013-11-22,-6,"Executives on Thursday acknowledged that they had underestimated the impact of the mobile revolution, and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich outlined plans to begin manufacturing semiconductors for other companies and develop microchips for cheaper tablets. But some analysts warn the latter was a margin-eroding move, arguing Intel still had no technology to dominate next-generation smartphones that run on 4G LTE standards. ”There was a lack of real, confidence-inspiring color on mobility,“ said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. ”It is about bringing something different to the table in mobility that can sustain their gross margin structure. “That’s what we didn’t get from the analysts’ day, to really convince us that they’re going to get back to growth.” On Thursday, Intel projected flat revenue and gross margins for 2014 - slightly below market projections for about 2 percent growth in sales. While analysts said the new CEO may be setting a low bar, others saw that as highlighting an uncertain 2014 and the difficulty of expanding margins as the PC market continues to shrink. The “2014 guidance gave investors their first hints of the potholes in store on the journey,” Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon wrote on Friday. “Intel is trying to buy their way into the tablet market at great near-term cost, and outlook for flat revenue, gross margins ... was disappointing.” Intel stock was down 4.8 percent at $24.02 at midday. "
2012-12-11,0,"The Atom chip rolled out on Tuesday uses much less electricity than Intel’s previous processors for servers and comes as Intel’s rivals also eye the low-power server niche. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money, and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. But Internet giants like Facebook, Amazon.Com and Google have been experimenting with ways to use low-power chips to make their data centers more efficient. At an Intel event launching the Atom chips, a Facebook infrastructure executive said the social network has found that low-power chips excel at processing the 4.5 billion updates, likes, posts and comments its 1 billion active users add to the site every day. “We do face unprecedented scale at Facebook, and that’s one of the reasons we’re so highly motivated to figure out the most efficient way to scale infrastructure efficiently and support all the people using Facebook,” said Frank Frankovsky, Facebook’s VP of hardware design and supply chain. He did not say whether Facebook expects to buy Intel’s new chips. Frankovsky said “wimpy” low-power chips in some cases can do the same work as Intel’s “brawny” Xeon chips while consuming half or a third as much power. “How much useful work can you get done per watt per dollar? That’s the only metric that matters,” Frankovsky said. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. In October, ARM unveiled new chip designs aimed at microservers. ARM believes servers using low-power chips based on its designs could account for a fifth of data centers by 2020. Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, declined to say how large Intel believes the microserver market could become. She said the Atom chips have been chosen for over 20 upcoming products focused on microservers, storage and communications. "

2014-11-20,-1,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Intel, helped by a stabilizing personal computer market, gave a revenue outlook for 2015 that was above Wall Street’s expectations and also raised its dividend, sending its shares higher. In a press release on Thursday, Intel said it expects revenue to grow by a mid-single digit percentage next year. Analysts on average have been forecasting 3.4 percent revenue growth for 2015. Kicking off Intel’s annual investor day, Chairman Andy Bryant said he saw progress in Intel’s strategy of staking out a big chunk of market share in tablets this year by offering manufacturers subsidies to use its chips. “I‘m not going to tell you I‘m proud of losing the kind of money we’re losing but I‘m also going to tell you I‘m not embarrassed by it like I was a year ago about where we were,” Bryant said. “This is the price you pay for sitting on the sidelines for a number of years and then fighting your way back into the market.” The Santa Clara, California company said it expects gross margins in 2015 to be 62 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points. Analysts on average expected 63 percent gross margins for 2015 and 2014. Capital spending next year will be about $10.5 billion, the company said, compared to about $11 billion expected in 2014. Intel also said it would increase its dividend by 6 cents to 96 cents on an annual basis. A global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s launch of the iPad four years ago has stabilized in recent months, in part due to companies replacing employees’ older laptops. Intel was late to mobile and under CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over last year, it has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones and compete better against Qualcomm, MediaTek and others. Krzanich said a plan disclosed this week to merge Intel’s mobile unit with its PC group was in line with manufacturing customers that see their own product lineups of smartphones, tablets and laptops merging. He said Intel was on track to exceed its goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year. That strategy made Intel the No 2 tablet chip supplier in the June quarter, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, but it cost the company billions of dollars in subsidies. Intel has made much less progress in chips for smartphones. Intel’s stock was up 2.9 percent at $35.34. "

(cnb.cx/1Do4pl4) That represented a 50 percent premium to Altera's price before news of the talks was first reported on March 27. Intel declined comment. Altera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Altera’s apparent refusal to do a deal puts pressure on its board, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “Investors are going to demand some explanations,” he said. “If the board and management can’t show a plan that would create a value at or above what Intel is offering, they are going to have to justify why they are saying no.” Late last month, Intel was reported to be in talks to buy Altera in a deal that could have topped $10 billion. Altera had a market capitalization of $12.6 billion as of Wednesday. Its shares had surged more than 20 percent since merger talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Had the deal gone through, the takeover would have been Intel’s largest acquisition, topping its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. Altera would appeal to Intel for its line of programmable chips, increasingly used in data centers and customized for functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks. Deals in the chip sector have been expected after NXP Semiconductors’ $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor was announced last month. Worldwide semiconductor mergers and acquisitions were worth $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows. In the 12 months through March 2, four hundred seventy-two chip M&A deals were made worldwide, up from 383 in the previous year. Market analysts said they expect the chip M&A boom to continue despite the end of the Altera-Intel talks. “Perhaps it impacts those two stocks but I don’t see it offsetting the major trend, which is certainly for more deals,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC.

2015-03-12,-4,"* Expects 1st-qtr rev of $12.8 bln, plus or minus $300 mln * Earlier forecast $13.7 bln, plus or minus $500 mln * Shares fall more than 5 pct By Anya George Tharakan and Sai Sachin R March 12 (Reuters) - Intel Corp slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers, sending the chipmaker’s shares down more than 5 percent. Fewer companies than Intel had expected replaced desktop PCs running on outdated Microsoft operating systems, leading to weak demand for its chips. Intel also cited “challenging” macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe. “The macro environment is not robust enough for people to upgrade their PCs the way they normally would,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji De Silva said. Intel said on Thursday that it expected first-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million - about 7 percent lower than its earlier forecast of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, Intel has been slower than rivals such as Qualcomm Inc to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. When Microsoft Corp wound down support for its Windows XP operating system last April, Intel had expected a bounce in demand from small- and medium-sized businesses. But this has not happened. Businesses and consumers are taking an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” attitude to their old PCs, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said. According to BlueFin Research Partners, 75 million-76 million PCs will be shipped worldwide in the first quarter, a decline of 8-9 percent from the preceding quarter. Intel, whose historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft once delivered breathtakingly high profit margins, has been trying to offset the impact of slower PC upgrades by making chips for devices such as “2-in-1s”, which function as both laptop and tablet. Intel said the mid-point of its gross margin range would remain at 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel’s shares were down 4.8 percent at $30.76 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Microsoft’s shares were down 2.4 percent at $41. Shares of ASML Holding NV, the world’s largest maker of semiconductor production equipment, were down 2 percent at $104.40.   (Editing by Don Sebastian, Robin Paxton and Kirti Pandey)"
2012-07-09,11,"ASML, the world’s largest maker of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers and a barometer for the chip sector, may want to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge chipmaking equipment, based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Intel will acquire an initial 10 percent stake in its European supplier and add another 5 percent pending shareholders’ approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. It also benefits by being able to move on to larger wafer sizes. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman estimates Intel can save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. Under the agreement, Intel gains no exclusive rights to future ASML products. But Freedman said Intel, as the sector leader, stands to gain if the overall industry benefits. “I was a little surprised that ASML did not offer exclusivity or preferential access,” Freedman said. But “if in fact they’re lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets, you’re opening markets as well.” A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps also push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months. The world’s top chipmaker will also help finance $1 billion of research into 450mm and extreme-ultraviolet chipmaking, both cutting-edge technologies that had been expected to emerge in the decade’s second half. While many semiconductor companies outsource the fabrication of actual chips to third-party “foundries,” Intel is among the last remaining chipmakers that build and operate their own network of multibillion dollar production facilities, or “fabs”. “If Intel is able to ramp 450mm production ahead of the world’s fabs such as TSMC or Global Foundries et al, it may yet prove that real men have fabs,” said John Jackson from CCS Insight. “There are signs that the global semiconductor fabrication sector is poised to realign.” Intel is the first major chipmaker to sign up for ASML’s “customer investment” program, under which it hopes to enlist partners to fund expensive research into 450mm wafer technology, a more economical chipmaking process. Under their agreement, Intel will pay 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) for the initial 10 percent slice of ASML, and a preliminary 553 million euros for research. The pact also involves advance orders of next-generation ASML chipmaking gear, strengthening the Dutch firm’s assurance to move ahead in developing the technology. Intel shares slid about 1 percent to $25.87 after hours, from a close of $26.17 on Nasdaq. ASML shot up 6.3 percent to $51.53 from a close of $48.46. ASML competes with Japanese groups Canon and Nikon. Its clients include Intel and Samsung Electronics. ($1 = 0.8130 euros) "
2012-06-01,2,"SAN FRANCISCO, June 1 (Reuters) - Engineers at Intel Corp  are applying lessons from aircraft design to create sturdier laptops in a bid to reduce the prices of the new ultra-thin computers the top chipmaker is promoting heavily. Intel is counting on the super-thin laptops, a category it has dubbed ultrabooks, to add some pizzazz to a PC market languishing due to the growing popularity of Apple Inc’s  iPad. Models expected later this year will have large touch screens, “instant on” responsiveness and razor-thin dimensions - all expensive features that have left some on Wall Street wondering if they might be too expensive for average consumers. Engineers at Intel’s Dupont, Washington R&D center, including former Boeing Co employees, have come up with a design method to make plastic laptop cases as strong as more-expensive metal ones typically used in ultrabooks, said Ben Broili, head of the team. He said that may cut the cost of future ultrabooks by between $25 and $75 by letting manufactures use plastic cases instead of metal ones without sacrificing quality. Their work is an example of the steps Intel is taking to find ways to make future ultrabooks more affordable - without cutting the prices of its processors. At a meeting with analysts last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said upcoming ultrabooks would be available for as little as $699, but many are expected to be priced nearer to $1,000 or more. Borrowing from product design methods used in the aerospace industry, the engineers have found that hard drives, motherboards and other components that make up the guts of a PC can be laid out in ways that make the laptops structure much stronger. “We didn’t develop a new material. We are able to use an existing plastic with an existing manufacturing technology,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. “It just requires some more upfront thought initially about how you lay your system out and how you can bring these things together and tie them in.” Different components in the laptop can be leveraged to support its chassis, or even dissipate heat from the processor, he said. “There is no one size fits all,” Broili added. “We’re trying to enable the entire industry. You can make trades, move stuff around; and if you don’t want your hard drive here, then move it. You have a menu you can pick from and see what you win or lose from a cost and quality standpoint.” Typically priced above $200 each, Intel’s processors are the costliest component in laptops. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is selling its new Trinity chips for less in a bid to undercut Intel in thin laptops. To get an idea of the structural quality of any laptop, Broili recommends lifting it up by a front corner while it is open and watching how much it flexes. Intel has already held a seminar in Taiwan to demonstrate its new design technique to PC design engineers and it is promoting it with specific manufacturers. At the Computex technology show in Taipei, Taiwan, next week, PC manufactures are set to unveil dozens of ultrabooks using Intel’s newest Ivy Bridge processors. They will also demonstrate future models with touch screens, based on Microsoft Corps’s Windows 8 platform, which is expected out later this year. Broili said Intel engineers are working on other ways to improve ultrabooks, including tweaks to motherboards, touch screens and Wifi. Separately, Intel launched a $300 million fund last year to invest in small companies focused on technologies complementing ultrabooks, such as improved battery life. A few ultrabook models launched this year have been reviewed as nice but pricey, leaving some analysts skeptical the category will attract mainstream shoppers. Otellini has said Intel is on track to reach its goal that  ultrabooks account for 40 percent of all consumer notebooks  sold by the end of the year. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage."
2013-05-30,-2,"Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings for its best-selling mobile devices. It employs Intel processors for its line of Microsoft Windows “ATIV” tablets -- a much smaller market compared with devices based on Google Inc’s Android. Samsung will unveil new ATIV tablets using Intel chips at a June 20 event in London, said the source, as well as an additional person familiar with the event. It was unclear whether the Galaxy Tab would debut at the same event. The Asian electronics giant’s decision to begin using Intel in a marquee Android device counts as a coup for the US chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in. It was unclear whether the Samsung, the world’s largest manufacturer of tablets after Apple, plans other versions of the 10-inch Galaxy Tab carrying its own, or other companies’, processors. A spokeswoman for South Korea-based Samsung declined to comment. An Intel spokesman also declined to comment. The use of an Intel Clover Trail+ chip in the upcoming tablet was first reported on by VentureBeat and other blogs last week. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but was slow to make chips that appealed to makers of smartphones and tablets as the market boomed following Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and iPad in 2010. Applications processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung and Nvidia now dominate a market that research firm Strategy Analytics estimated could hit $25 billion by 2016 versus $9 billion in 2011. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who took the helm this month, has stated that one of his top goals is to expand the Silicon Valley chipmaker’s footprint in mobile devices. Intel is rushing to adapt its powerful PC chips to use less energy and work more efficiently in mobile devices. It has so far scored a few minor “design wins”, getting its processors into a few mobile devices. For instance, an Intel mobile processor was used in a version of Motorola’s Razr smartphone launched last year in markets like Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany and Mexico. Intel has yet to launch chips capable of supporting high-speed Long Term Evolution technology, a major barrier to competing in mobile devices aimed at the United States, where the standard is becoming increasingly common. Samsung has nearly 18 percent of the market for tablets, according to IDC. "
2014-07-15,3,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, July 15 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  believes the worst is over for a personal computer industry hammered by the mobile revolution. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street’s expectations on Tuesday, sending its stock 4 percent higher in extended trade. Investors have pushed shares of PC mainstays Microsoft Corp  and Intel to decade-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc’s  launch of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom. “PCs have stabilized,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters after Intel’s report. He said he expects shrinking demand from consumers in China and other developing countries to rebound, just as it recently has in the United States. From the end of 2010, the year the iPad was launched, to the end of 2013, annual global PC shipments shrank a total of 12 percent, according to IDC. Intel now expects the market’s recovery to help it grow its full-year revenue about 5 percent, slightly higher than prior expectations. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that improved demand from companies replacing old PCs would last at least through the end of 2014. Also on Tuesday, Intel increased its share buyback program by $20 billion. It plans to repurchase about $4 billion of stock in the current quarter, underscoring its confidence in a turnaround and a growing crop of “two in one” devices with detachable keyboards and screens. “My presumption would be that if they’re confident enough to boost it that they see this (PC market) upside maintaining,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “God help them if they’re wrong.” Intel said in a statement it expects third-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts had expected $14 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from Intel’s PC group rose 6 percent in the quarter while its data center group, a big contributor to gross margins, had revenue jump 19 percent. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and tablets. For the second quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group’s revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million and had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Intel’s second-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In June, Intel revised increased its second-quarter revenue outlook to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, citing stronger-than-expected demand for PCs used by businesses. Intel posted second-quarter net income of $2.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared with $2.0 billion, or 39  cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Intel shares closed up 0.70 percent at $31.71 in regular trade on Nasdaq.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Bernard Orr)"
2014-01-14,-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Intel Corp, hit by slumping personal computer sales, has put off opening a major chip factory that President Barack Obama once held up as an example of U.S. manufacturing potential. The “Fab 42” facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, will remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Intel’s decision not to open the chip plant was first reported by the Arizona Republic on Tuesday. “The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies,” Mulloy told Reuters. Despite not opening the new factory, or fab, Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1,000 employees since construction started in 2011, Mulloy said. Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people. Obama, while campaigning for re-election in 2012, made a stop at the factory’s construction site, where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the United States. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it was caught off guard by smartphones and tablets, a computing revolution that has cut into demand for PCs, the company’s core business. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, the worst year since market research firm Gartner began tracking those products. “The newer fab has not been equipped with the capital equipment. It has heating and air conditioning but the actual tools, the expensive stuff, are not in there,” Mulloy said. Much of Intel’s strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Intel originally meant to install its most advanced manufacturing technology at the plant and make 14 nanometer microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin. Existing factories at the Chandler site using Intel’s previous generation of manufacturing, 22 nm, are being converted to also make chips at 14 nm and many of Intel’s new employees are working there, Mulloy said. “It boils down to better capital utilization,” Mulloy said. The Santa Clara, California-based company says it makes around two thirds of its microprocessors in the United States, with others produced in Ireland, Israel and China. It is currently expanding a plant in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 millimeters - about the size of a large pizza. The largest wafers currently used in the chip industry measure 300 mm across. Plans by Intel and big rivals like Samsung Electronics  to eventually expand to 450 mm will allow them to save manufacturing costs by squeezing more chips on each wafer. Intel, which on Thursday is due to report is fourth-quarter earnings, said in November it expects its revenue to be flat in 2014 compared to last year."
2013-05-21,-1,"Details of the reorganization were outlined in an internal memo sent to employees on Monday. It was described to Reuters by a company source and details of the reorganization, which is effective immediately, were confirmed by spokesman Chuck Mulloy on Tuesday. “As your CEO I am committed to making quick, informed decisions. I am committed to being bolder, moving faster, and accepting that this means changes will be made knowing that we will listen, learn and then make adjustments in order to keep pace with a rapidly changing industry,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. “Our business faces significant challenges, and we simply must continue to execute while finalizing our future strategy,” he reportedly wrote. Krzanich officially took over as CEO last week and said that under his leadership, the top chipmaker will be more responsive to customers in an intensified focus on the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market where it lags rivals. The chipmaker’s main product groups - including the PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Intel Architecture group chief Dadi Perlmutter - now report directly to Krzanich. After Perlmutter transfers his business groups, he and Krzanich will “define his next significant contribution at Intel,” according to the email described by the source. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets. The latter two markets are now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. In his three-decade career at Intel, Krzanich has become known for making fast decisions after consulting with trusted lieutenants. This week’s reorganization is Krzanich’s first step in a process aimed at making Intel more focused and more agile, Mulloy said. “The new devices organization is responsible for rapidly turning brilliant technical and business model innovations into products that shape and lead markets,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. James, formerly head of the software arm, will now also oversee the company’s sprawling global manufacturing operations and all aspects of security technology. Mulloy said Intel presidents have traditionally been responsible for managing the manufacturing operations. James will also lead corporate strategy and planning. Her previous job as Intel’s software chief has been taken over by Doug Fisher, a senior executive from that group. Hermann Eul previously shared responsibility for Intel’s mobile communications group, which makes smartphone chips, with Bell, and he will now take full responsibility for that business. Senior Intel executives in the past have privately warned against focusing too much on catching up in smartphones and tablets at the expense of missing out on future trends in mobile. Krzanich’s creation of the “new devices” group signals he is also looking beyond today’s gadgets. “It’s a matter of what they do with the new division, what can they identify and then deliver that maybe would not have otherwise been something we’d see Intel inside of. It could be very meaningful if they can execute,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Venture capital fund Intel Capital, led by Arvind Sodhani, now reports to Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith instead of to the CEO. Intel’s IT department, which reported to Krzanich before his appointment as CEO, will also now report to Smith. Shares of Intel were up 0.2 percent at $24.13 on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq. "
2014-03-26,7,"* Agreement extends previous manufacturing deal * Technology aims to make chips more efficient   (Adds comment from Intel executive, stock prices) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, March 26 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Altera Corp  is working with Intel Corp to combine separate components like processors, memory and programmable chips into customized devices in a technique aimed at reducing manufacturing costs and improving performance. The new agreement, to produce what are known in the technology world as “multi-die” devices, builds on a deal announced over a year ago for Intel to open its most advanced factories to produce Altera’s programmable chips, Brad Howe, Altera’s senior vice president of research and development, told Reuters late on Tuesday. It also reflects strategy at Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, to look for growth opportunities in new markets and reduce the company’s reliance on the slowing personal computer industry. Both companies are contributing packaging and semiconductor expertise that will help Altera improve the performance of chips for communications, high-performance computing and military applications. “We’re partnering to bring those technologies together in a single-package solution,” Howe said. Multi-die packaging is aimed at efficiently connecting separately made components as one device. Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components. Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller-form devices that use less energy and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips. Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel’s factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc. Intel’s manufacturing agreement with Altera is going “exceptionally well,” Sunit Rikhi, general manager of Intel’s contract manufacturing business, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our close collaboration enables us to work together in many areas related to semiconductor manufacturing and packaging.” The deal to share Intel’s prized manufacturing technology with Altera is the most notable of its kind so far for Intel. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in November he wanted more customers. Far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel views adding more manufacturing customers as one way to keep its multibillion-dollar factories operating at optimal levels. In February, Intel said that a new facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project to produce its most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Shares of Intel were down 0.3 percent at $25.39 while Altera’s stock was 1.2 percent lower at $35.98 on Wednesday afternoon.

2013-11-20,-9,"The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project confirmed media reports that Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc Google Inc Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in February 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC, CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.” "
2013-01-31,-7,"By Jeremy Wagstaff and Clare Jim Jan 31 (Reuters) - Intel Corp, the world’s biggest chipmaker, opened a new front on Thursday in a long and stuttering campaign to get its processors into mobile phones, although it appears to still have a long way to go. It joined PC maker Acer Inc in Bangkok to unveil the Liquid C1 smartphone, a $330 device running Google Inc’s  Android operating system, which will be launched first in Thailand and then rolled out across Southeast Asia, one of the fastest-growing markets for mobile phones. “We’ve made a conscious effort to go after these fast-growing markets as our first foray into the business,” Mike Bell, who heads Intel’s mobile division said in a telephone interview. The company’s ninth such device in nine months, the Liquid C1 represents how far Intel has come in convincing bigger name manufacturers to take a chance with its mobile chips as the sales of personal computers and laptops plunge. But analysts say it also shows how far it still has to go to get a foothold in a  market dominated by the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp. “First and foremost they have to prove they can play in this space at all,” said Scott Bicheno, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. “There’s no obvious technical fault with Intel’s chips. It’s just that the incumbents are very well established.” Intel has little choice but to get into mobile. It saw revenue fall 3 percent in the last quarter on weak sales of PCs, part of a steady decline in revenue growth since 2009. It has also watched as devices like Apple Inc’s  iPad cannibalise sales of PCs. So, in the past year, the company has launched phones with Intel chips in Europe, Africa, Latin America, Russia, India and China. Some were effectively designed and built by Intel as what it calls “calling cards”, convincing carriers like Orange to brand and offer the phones on their own networks in France and the United Kingdom. Last year, it persuaded Chinese hardware manufacturers like ZTE Corp  and Lenovo Group Ltd to build their own phones with Intel chips. Sales have not been stellar. Intel declined to share data, as did ZTE and Lenovo. But Melissa Chau, senior research manager at technology research group IDC, said while Lenovo shipped more than 1 million units of its best-selling phone in China in the third quarter of last year, it shipped only about 20,000 of its first Intel phone, the K800. “That’s the scale we’re talking here,” she said. In the past year or so, however, Intel seems to have shifted focus to mobile applications. It acquired Infineon Technologies’ wireless chip business in 2011 and hired and promoted phone experts like Bell. “These guys are phone specialists and they’ve really turned us around in terms of of the way we approach the market, the way we approach design,” said Uday Marty, managing director for Intel in Southeast Asia. It seems to be working, at least in terms of quality. UK-based Bicheno says the Motorola RAZR i phone that he has been using, which has an Intel chip, performs as well as any other Android phone. “They’ve learned a huge amount about the mobile world and how different it is, through their years of failures,” said Caroline Gabriel, head of research at consultancy Rethink Wireless. “Intel did not understand the process of getting devices onto carrier networks in the past, but it does now.” Intel has several aces up its sleeve. For one thing, it has longstanding relationships with the likes of Acer, Lenovo and Asustek Computer Inc, all of whom are in a similar predicament: as PC makers, they all need to grow their mobile business. But even then, they have been slow jumping aboard. Industry sources in Taiwan said that Intel had offered extensive lures to try its mobile chips. Intel executives acknowledged they had shouldered some costs but said it did not extend as far as  buying a production line of the PC makers. Intel, too, has used its experience in optimising its computers chips for Microsoft Windows software to work closely with Google on making Android run well on its devices. “We are not just investing in chips, we’re investing heavily in the software to run around them,” said Bell. This would doom it to playing a high-volume, low-margin game against low-cost chip makers in Taiwan like Mediatek. Intel counters that it is targeting the $200-$500 segment because that’s where a lot of the growth is, and that it intends to eventually offer chips that, like its PC chips, range across all price points. Intel executives also say they Will be offering a chip either later this year or early in 2014 that works on the 4G LTE networks already deployed in the United States and currently being rolled out in Europe. The problem there, says Gabriel of Rethink Wireless, is that it will then be lagging the likes of Qualcomm and STMicroelectronics. Another concern is whether Intel can move beyond its usual partners. Persuading the likes of Acer and Lenovo to push out a smartphone is one thing, analysts say, but what about established phone makers like HTC Corp, let alone dominant players Samsung and Apple? Only then would Intel be able to get the volumes necessary for decent margins. In the long run, analysts said, a company with the resources of Intel had a reasonable chance of building at least some business in mobile. “Given Intel’s vast resources, I am not one to easily discount their ability to get into any market that they target,” said Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst at the IHS research firm. And as Intel’s Bell points out, the rapid fall of players like BlackBerry and Nokia, and the equally rapid rise of Samsung and Apple, suggest that just because Intel is a bit player now, it may not always be. “I was at a different firm building phones a couple of years ago and the company that was going to dominate Earth was RIM,” said Bell, who has worked at both Palm and Apple. He was referring to the Blackberry maker that has seen market share slip heavily in the past few years. “We’ll see two years from now who’s the market leader.”   (Additional reporting Lee Chyenyee in Hong Kong; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

2013-11-20,-6,"By Noel Randewich, Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker Nov 20 (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company.

But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something  that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC  , CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc  and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.”   (Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco, Ron Grover in Los Angeles and Liana B.

2015-07-15,-3,"The company has been expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers to counter slowing demand from the PC industry and agreed to buy Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion in April as part of these efforts. Revenue from the data center business, Intel’s second-largest, grew 9.7 percent to $3.85 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by continued adoption of cloud services and demand for data analytics. “We continue to forecast robust growth rates of the data center group, Internet of Things group and NAND businesses, which we expect to mostly offset the PC decline,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said on a post-earnings call. Revenue from the PC business, Intel’s largest, fell 13.5 percent to $7.54 billion in the quarter ended June 27. “Our expectations are that the PC market is going to be weaker than previously expected,” Smith said. Research firm Gartner forecast global PC shipments to fall 4.5 percent to 300 million units in 2015, with no respite until at least 2016. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also cut its 2015 capex forecast to $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. It had cut its full-year capex forecast to $8.7 billion from $10 billion in April. Intel’s continued focus on keeping spending down is probably the strongest positive in its quarterly report, Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said. The company's net income fell to $2.71 billion from $2.80 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, were flat at 55 cents as the number of outstanding shares fell. (bit.ly/1Hvmgay) Analysts had expected a profit of 50 cents per share. Net revenue fell 4.6 percent to $13.19 billion, but edged past the average analyst estimate of $13.04 billion. Up to Wednesday’s close, Intel’s stock had plunged about 18 percent this year, compared with an 2.9 percent fall in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX. "
2016-01-14,-5,"The world’s largest chipmaker reported data center revenue of $4.31 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, missing consensus estimate of $4.42 billion, according to Jefferies & Co.  Revenue in the business rose only 4 percent from the preceding quarter, compared with the 8 percent growth in the third quarter. “I think companies are probably not upgrading their own data center as they know they are eventually going to convert to the cloud,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus and Co Inc. “So they are going to put Band-Aids on their current servers and not upgrade them,” Cassidy said. In October, Intel had cut its 2015 revenue growth forecast for the data center business, as companies slash spending due to weak macroeconomic growth. Excluding items, Intel forecast revenue of $14.1 billion, plus or minus $500 million for the first quarter ending March. The midpoint of this range is down 6 percent from the fourth quarter, the company said.   “While the outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution for overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016,” Krzanich said on a post-earnings call. Revenue in the personal computer business fell about 1 percent to $8.76 billion from a year earlier.  Global personal computer shipments fell 10.6 percent in the quarter ended in December from a year earlier, IDC said on Tuesday, the largest decline since the research firm started tracking PC shipments.    The fourth quarter of 2015 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of worldwide PC shipments decline, according to rival research firm Gartner.  Intel completed its $16.7 billion purchase of programmable-chip maker Altera Corp in December, a deal that adds a new class of products to Intel’s portfolio.  The company's net income fell to $3.61 billion from $3.66 billion in the fourth quarter. (bit.ly/1mYZC4o) On a per share basis, earnings were flat at 74 cents.

(bit.ly/1Fk3FL4) “A deal is likely by the end of next week,” the newspaper quoted the source as saying. The source also cautioned that the talks could still fall apart. Intel signed a standstill agreement earlier this year with Altera that expires on June 1, giving the world’s largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, Reuters reported in April, citing sources. Altera in April rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, the sources told Reuters. Avago Technologies Ltd agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever.

2014-10-13,1,"“We’ve entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it’s started to help the local semiconductor industry,” said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel’s beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company’s years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal. The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips. China is the world’s largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan. China’s ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry. For Intel, the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world’s biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.  Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People’s Congress, said in March that China’s $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country’s entire yearly petroleum imports. In June, the State Council offered the country’s most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020. An important part of Beijing’s effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq. The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing. As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA. Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan’s MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup. A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek. Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel’s architecture. “With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,” Krzanich told reporters in September. “We go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D and we help local companies.” Intel’s deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China’s largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm’s smartphone chips. As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometer manufacturing technology. It also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm. Critics say the probe unfairly targets foreign companies in order to help domestic companies, which Chinese authorities flatly deny. Krzanich first discussed ways to collaborate with the Chinese firms during a visit to Tsinghua University in April, where he and Intel China head Yang Xu met Tsinghua Holding’s Xu Jinhong, Unigroup’s Zhou Weiguo, Spreadtrum founder Li Liyou, who is also a Tsinghua University alumnus. He made a second trip to Beijing, the whirlwind visit in August, after which the deal fell into place. “Tsinghua University is an important driving force for the development of national science and technology, and Tsinghua Holdings is a key part of that effort,” Tsinghua Holdings Chief Executive Xu Jinhong told Reuters by email. Xu characterized the Intel investment as “a new model for cooperation between Chinese and U.S. companies in the chip industry.” Analysts say that Intel’s deal will give the Santa Clara-based company a moderate boost by gaining a partner with strong relationships with local phone manufacturers. The deal should also give Intel enough protection of its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and other conditions, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. “There’s potential benefits for everyone,” Kennedy said.

2014-10-15,-1,"Intel said in a statement on Tuesday that demand for its chips was in good shape. “The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycles,” Intel said. The recovering PC industry has helped push Intel’s shares 24 percent higher in 2014, making it the top performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. “The telling thing will be next year. Do we continue to get a healthier, more stable PC market?,” said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. “I think the enterprise refresh largely plays out by the end of 2014 and then next year the PC industry returns to modest annual declines.”  Tuesday’s results, the first from a major technology company this earnings season, came after Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip (MCHP.O) warned last Thursday of weak demand in China that would soon become visible across the chip industry, sparking a broad selloff in chip stocks. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and has been spending heavily to catch up to Qualcomm (QCOM.O).  For the third quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion on revenue of $1 million, reflecting subsidies Intel has been paying to persuade tablet makers to use its chips. Intel posted third-quarter net income of $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as demand for personal computers stabilized. Analysts on average expected EPS of 65 cents. Third-quarter revenue was $14.6 billion, up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.  Analysts on average expected third-quarter revenue of $14.44 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $14.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2012-11-19,-2,"* Intel says transition could take six months * Chipmaker promotes three executives * Intel’s dominant position slipped as PC sales declined By Noel Randewich and Liana B. Baker SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will retire sooner than expected and the top chipmaker said it may name an outsider for the position for the first time to steer a difficult transition toward mobile computing. Intel, which has selected chief executives from within its own ranks throughout its 45-year history, said it would consider both internal and external candidates in a transition expected to last six months. Otellini will retire in May at the age of 62, earlier than the company’s mandatory retirement age for CEOs of 65. Intel’s fifth chief executive, Otellini has worked at the company for nearly 40 years and became CEO in 2005. Intel’s board was surprised last week when Otellini announced he planned to retire and it tried to get Otellini to stay, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said. Some Wall Street analysts said it might make sense for Intel to consider hiring an outsider to shake up its strategy as the computing world goes through its most significant shift since the advent of the Internet. But internal candidates will have a leg up over potential outside contenders because of Intel’s size, complexity and engineer-driven culture, Mulloy said. “For any company of the size and complexity of Intel, an internal candidate would have a natural advantage,” he said. However, Mulloy added: “Good corporate governance dictates today you should look inside and out.” Intel, whose processors are dominant in personal computers, has been slow to expand into the fast-growing mobile industry, where Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones and other popular mobile devices use competing technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc. “We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now. It’s the era of Intel versus ARM, so it may be good to come in with some fresh blood and a new perspective,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. Intel said it was promoting three executives to become executive vice presidents: Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Brian Krzanich, who is chief operating officer and oversees manufacturing; and Stacy Smith, chief financial officer and director of corporate strategy. Smith, well-known by Wall Street, and Krzanich have in the past been viewed as potential CEOs. “There is a comfort level with Stacy (Smith),” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, made a name for himself improving the efficiency of the chipmaker’s cutting-edge factories. He was promoted to chief operating officer last March, effectively throwing him in the running for the post of CEO. Analysts said James’ focus on software instead of hardware made her less likely to be promoted to CEO. Bryant pointed to Krzanich, Smith and James, as well as Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile, as important executives for Intel’s future, according to Barron‘s. “Previous CEO transitions have all involved carefully groomed internal candidates. But if Intel’s board is now looking externally -- to bring in new skills -- that would explain the lack of a named successor and length of time in transition,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. Intel’s board may have trouble finding an outsider with the strategic vision to lead it into the mobile market as well as the chops to run the cutting-edge factories that give the chipmaker a technological lead over its competitors. Since most other chipmakers have closed down their fabrication plants over the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running plants that now cost upwards of $10 billion each to build. Armed with a bachelor’s degree in economics and an MBA from the University of California, Otellini began at Intel in 1974, when most of the company’s sales came from memory chips and before it turned to PC processors. He managed several business units before being appointed chief operating officer in 2002. The top chipmaker is currently running its factories at less than 50 percent of capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used for more cutting-edge production lines still being built. The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for batttery-powered smartphones and tablets. Its market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leads some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, to ask if Intel’s supremacy has come to an end and whether the company’s potential for profit and revenue growth may be limited. Intel’s shares closed up 0.3 percent at $20.25 in Nasdaq trading on Monday. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s smaller rival in PC processors, rose 3.22 percent to $1.92."
2015-04-14,3,"“It’s slightly better than feared,” said Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital markets. “It looks like bottom line impacts are mitigated by better expenses, interest income and taxes.”    Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $500 million, based on expectations of stronger demand for its personal computer chips and continued strength in its data center business. Analysts were expecting $13.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Intel forecast flat revenue, also in line with Wall Street’s estimates.  “I think the full-year guidance being flat year over year (is) supportive of a stable PC environment, despite the first-quarter weakness,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji Desilva said.  Intel said it would cut 2015 capital expenditures to $8.7 billion from $10 billion, a reduction that analysts said should improve free cash flow. Intel’s shares rose 2 percent to $32.05 in after-market trading. Intel reported revenue of $12.8 billion for the first quarter, ended March 28, flat with a year ago and slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $12.9 billion. The chipmaker had slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast by nearly $1 billion to $12.8 billion in March, citing weak demand for PCs that use the company’s chips. The company posted net income of $1.99 billion, or 41 cents per share, up from $1.93 billion, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 41 cents. The company, which reported consolidated results for its PC and money-losing mobile businesses for the first time, had posted better-than-expected profits in the last four quarters. Analysts have criticized the consolidation, saying it limits transparency, especially into the mobile business. Intel has been lagging behind rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and ARM Holdings Plc — the British company behind the processor in Apple’s iPhone 6 — in the fast-growing smartphone market.     "
2014-04-15,2,"Following its first-quarter report on Tuesday, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the chipmaker continues to expects PC shipments to decline slightly in 2014. “But there are pretty clear signs of stabilization,” Smith told Reuters. “You have an ageing install base of PCs and we’re bringing exciting products to the market place and that’s leading to the pockets of strength we’re seeing in the PC market.” In its report, Intel said revenue from its PC client group in the first quarter was $7.9 billion, down 1 percent from the year before. The company also expects a full-year gross margin of 61 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. That is 1 percentage point higher than Intel’s previous forecast. Intel shares rose 1.6 percent in extended trading after closing up 0.80 percent at $26.77 on Nasdaq. “The margin guidance is what’s pushing the stock up. The PC client group was roughly in line with seasonal,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Tuesday’s results included a new financial reporting structure to better reflect its focus on two small key areas: mobile and the growing field of linking up electronic devices, known as Internet of Things. Intel said its mobile and communications group had revenue of $156 million in the first quarter, down 61 percent from the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that Intel shipped 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter and is on track to reach a goal of shipping 40 million tablet chips in 2014. Last year, Intel shipped 10 million tablet chips and to reach its target for 2014, the company is offering to heavily subsidize manufacturers’ costs to include its components in their future tablets. Asked whether Intel expected that some of those mobile chips might be used in low-end laptops instead of tablets, CFO Smith said: “We mean 40 million tablets with Intel chips in them by the end of this year, with the majority of those being Android-based tablets.” After underestimating the impact of smartphones and tablets, Intel is keen to make sure it is part of an emerging trend toward wearable computing devices such as smart watches. In March, it bought Basis Science, the maker of a wearable health tracker, as part of that push. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a major splash with consumers any time soon. Analysts are skeptical that chips for wearables will be able to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost because of the shrinking PC industry. Intel’s data center group, a big contributor to the company’s overall profits, had revenue of $3.1 billion in the first quarter, up 11 percent year over year. The chipmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $1.947 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $2.045 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average expected 37 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue was $12.76 billion, compared with $12.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Analysts had expected $12.814 billion. Intel forecast revenue of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the second quarter, which ends in June. Analysts had expected $12.957 billion on average. "
2012-07-10,5,"* Intel’s $4.1 bln spending includes R&D, stake buy * Intel first to sign onto ASML investment program * ASML talking to TSMC, Samsung Electronics about similar deals   (Recasts, add talks with TSMC, Samsung Electronics) By Edwin Chan and Sara Webb SAN FRANCISCO/AMSTERDAM, July 10 (Reuters) - ASML, the world’s top chip equipment maker, signed up Intel Corp  to bankroll its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, and aims to reach similar deals with TSMC  and Samsung Electronics. ASML’s chief executive said on Tuesday the Dutch firm had asked its three three biggest customers - Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Electronics - to help fund its R&D in exchange for up to 25 percent of its shares. Following Intel’s decision, it expects to announce more customer investments in the coming weeks. ASML shares rose 10 percent on the news. Intel fell about 1 percent after hours. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon , but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. “We’re talking about $50 tablets” said Richard Windsor, Nomura’s global technology specialist. “This brings into the realms of possibility a technology that we thought wasn’t feasible and opens up the possibility for greater cost reductions”. Intel said on Monday it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent of ASML and fund its research. TSMC said it was considering a similar deal. Intel hopes to speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require huge capital investment, but would deliver billions of savings by cutting chip production costs. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Under the terms of the deal, Intel will invest $1 billion in research into those two technologies, which are expected to emerge in the next few years. It will also acquire an initial 10 percent stake in ASML and tack on another 5 percent if it wins shareholder approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. Shares in rival Nikon, which also researches and develops lithography processes, fell 7 percent on the news. A spokesman said Nikon “would like to continue our cooperation with Intel going forward”. “In a bold move to bring heavy investment into its future development needs, tie in large customers and damage any Nikon ambitions in EUV, ASML has delivered a strong message of strategic intent for the next semi cycle and beyond,” Jeffries International research said in a note. Intel and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand as consumers shift to mobile devices, and economic growth in Europe and even emerging markets is weakening. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned its second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent, blaming disappointing demand from China and Europe. RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman said Intel could save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Intel Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” Intel, the world’s top chipmaker, gains no exclusive rights to ASML products in the deal. But Freedman said Intel stood to gain if the overall industry benefited and by lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets would open new markets. Intel remains at the vanguard of computer processors but is seeing rivals like Samsung Electronics come on strong in application of microchips for smartphones and other mobile devices. Analysts say the U.S. company maintains a two-year lead over the competition but needs to spend heavily to safeguard that. A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months. While many semiconductor companies outsource the fabrication of actual chips to third-party “foundries”, Intel is among the last remaining chipmakers that build and operate their own network of multibillion dollar production facilities, or “fabs”.

2013-05-02,2,"The company surprised investors last November by suggesting it would consider the possibility of an outside CEO, though even at that time Krzanich was still considered a strong candidate for the job. Following are analyst reactions to the news: ”An external candidate might have been a better choice - with no negative reflection on Brian - simply because of the juncture Intel is at with what’s happening in the PC market and the need to take major action outside of PCs. “Maybe an external candidate with a fresh set of eyes without being beholden to any legacy business division, personnel, or strategy might have been better.” ”He was the obvious choice from the standpoint that they selected the COO as their CEO several times in the past. This removes the risk of uncertainty of an outsider coming in and changing the strategy at the company. I think the street will perceive it as Intel’s strategy remaining consistent.” "

2015-04-27,-4,"By Liana B. Baker April 27 (Reuters) - TIG Advisors LLC, an investment firm that holds shares in Altera Corp, challenged a nomination to the company’s board of  directors on Monday over Altera’s refusal to engage with Intel Corp about a potential merger. TIG Advisors is the first shareholder to go on the record in a bid to put pressure on Altera. It urged Altera’s shareholders in a letter on Monday to vote against the company’s nomination for lead independent director,  Michael Nevens, at its annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for May 11. Altera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Stockholders should have right to choose between Intel’s reported $54 cash offer and uncertain future of standalone Altera,” TIG Advisors said in a letter to Altera and shareholders. The firm also said it has spoken to many of the “core institutional” shareholders in Altera who also believe $54 is a compelling offer for the company. Altera’s earnings report April 23 also disappointed investors with lower-than-expected results. Investors deserve a strategic plan from Altera that can deliver value to shareholders and can compete with Intel’s offer, TIG said. Altera appeals to Intel for its line of programmable chips, increasingly used in data centers and customized for functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks, but talks have been off during the past few weeks. Altera shares were trading 33 cents lower, down by 0.8 percent on Monday at $40.57 per share. It had a market capitalization of $12.27 billion on Monday, compared to Intel’s market value of $153.86 billion. Worldwide semiconductor mergers and acquisitions were worth $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows.

2015-01-20,2,"Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich surprised a mostly male crowd at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas by unveiling a 2020 goal for Intel to employ more women and minorities. Diversity has become a major corporate issue in the United States as companies look to improve their images and for ways to boost productivity by tapping new groups of potential employees. Intel’s effort is one of the largest to date by cash spent. Silicon Valley has a dismal track record employing those groups, and Intel is no exception: just a quarter of its U.S. employees in 2013 were women and 12 percent were Hispanic or African American, it said. By comparison, about one-third of bachelor degrees granted in computers and math go to women, according to the National Science Foundation.  Krzanich described plans for educational initiatives, an area where Intel already spends $100 million annually with an undisclosed but small portion focusing on women and minorities. He also broadly promised to improve hiring and retention.  A shortfall of women and minorities receiving technology-oriented education is often seen as the leading barrier to a diverse workforce in Silicon Valley. An opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle said Intel’s plans “hinge on the available talent produced by a limited educational pipeline.” Prominent venture capitalist Paul Graham told online publication the Information last year that the lack of women technology entrepreneurs and programmers was a problem “10 years upstream of us.” Diversity advocates say seizing on the supply issue can obscure other causes.  “They are blaming the pipeline for their own faults,” said Vivek Wadhwa, author of “Innovating Women,” noting that many technology companies no longer consider degrees of any sort, including computer science (CS), a requirement for employment.  “If male flunkies can join (tech companies), why do women need to have CS degrees?” he asked. “This is an excuse.” Of all science and engineering graduates, only about 31 percent of males and 15 percent of females work in related occupations, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Just 17 percent of African Americans with science and engineering degrees go on to work in related jobs.  To draw women and minorities, Intel should make managers accountable to specific diversity goals and measure progress through employee surveys, said Katherine Kimpel, a lawyer specializing in discrimination at Sanford Heisler Kimpel LLP. Intel CEO Krzanich said he would tie executive compensation to hitting diversity targets. The company also plans to factor diversity into year-end bonuses, a spokeswoman said. Lori Nishiura Mackenzie, executive director of Stanford University’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research, said Intel should spend the bulk of its cash on what she called “the frozen middle” just below the top executives. EBay has a workforce that is 42 percent female, compared with around 30 percent for most technology companies. A spokeswoman said women in leadership positions rose 30 percent annually after eBay launched a gender initiative, including mentorship of five women per senior executive, at the end of 2010.    Telle Whitney, chief executive officer of the Anita Borg Institute, which focuses on women and technology, said that the best return on investment is for companies to combat unconscious bias: unintentional discrimination that comes out in words and actions. Many technology companies now offer managers training in this area, including Google Inc and Microsoft Corp. Intel already has unconscious bias training and plans more, the spokeswoman said. Avivah Wittenberg-Cox, who runs a diversity consultancy called 20-First, said Intel should focus on improving diversity in its top three management layers, through steps such as encouraging different departments to compete on goals. Intel President Renee James is female, but the chipmaker has no Hispanics or blacks at its highest levels. Silicon Valley is still seen as a nerdy boys club that is not interested in diversity, Wittenberg-Cox said. “Until that image and mindset changes, the numbers will not follow.”  "
2014-01-16,-11,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its data center customers and also pointed to political controversy in Washington, DC. In the December quarter, Intel’s PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected. Microsoft Corp’s plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees’ PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter. Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry’s decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets. The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media. But the 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected. “The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,” said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise.” Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc   and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. “We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,” he told analysts. But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. “The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,” Smith told Reuters. “What’s driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we’ve been working on.” At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry-watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers anytime soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry. Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers. Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel were down 3.5 percent in extended trade on Thursday after closing 0.5 percent lower at $25.61 on the Nasdaq. One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome. “You’re getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “This management team is not running this company to deliver earnings.”   (Editing by Matthew Lewis)"
2015-10-13,-4,"Intel has been counting on the data center business to help offset declining demand for its chips used in personal computers, its biggest revenue generator. The company agreed in June to acquire Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion to expand its line-up of the higher-margin chips used in data centers. Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center business to grow in “low double digits” in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent growth. The business, the company’s second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter.  The company was not “rethinking the long-term growth” of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call. “It’s a combination of two things — data center weakness and units — it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,” analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said. The weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company’s better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter. Intel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel said revenue from its PC business fell 7.5 percent to $8.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner. Intel’s net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of 59 cents per share.  Net revenue declined to $14.47 billion from $14.55 billion, but beat analysts’ estimate of $14.22 billion. Up to Tuesday’s close of $32.04, Intel’s stock had fallen 11.7 percent this year, steeper than the 9.4 percent fall in the broader semiconductor index .SOX. "
2013-04-16,-2,"Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, that amounts to roughly no change or a drop of as much as 8 percent. Analysts had expected $12.588 billion in revenue for the first quarter and $12.854 billion for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel posted first-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.74 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected 41 cents per share. “These numbers are not very solid, but the second-quarter guidance is better than feared. Conditions are probably not as bad as industry reports have suggested recently,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital. Shares of Intel edged down less than 1 percent in extended trade after closing up 2.5 percent at $21.91 on Nasdaq. "
2014-11-03,2,"Falling behind Qualcomm in recent years after it was slow to embrace smartphones and tablets, Intel has been keen to make sure its processors are at the front of future technology trends. CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the “Make it Wearable” contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel’s chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market. “This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,” Krzanich said at an award event on Monday. “The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas.” Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis. It also has teamed up on other wrist-worn gadgets with Fossil and Opening Ceremony. Krzanich, a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 Land Cruiser in his free time, is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets. To that end, Intel launched Edison, a tiny computer packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products. "

The impact of Intel favouring equipment built by ASML would not be immediate, but could begin to show up in results as the next generation of etching equipment is introduced over the next couple of years, an analyst told Reuters, on condition he was not identified. Chipmaking equipment accounts for around one-tenth of sales at the Japanese company, which is better known for its cameras.

2014-12-01,4,"By Euan Rocha TORONTO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Monday it has acquired PasswordBox, a Montreal-based identity management service that gives users a convenient way to log into websites and applications from any device without having to type or remember passwords. The purchase price for the privately held Canadian start-up was not disclosed. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said PasswordBox will become part of the Safe Identity organization within Intel Security Group that is focused on simplifying and strengthening security by delivering ideas that reduce the pain of having to memorize dozens of passwords. Earlier this year, Intel rebranded security software maker McAfee Inc, which it acquired for about $7.7 billion in 2011, as Intel Security Group. PasswordBox, founded in 2012, has already been downloaded 14 million times and this year it won best mobile app at CES, a huge annual consumer electronics tradeshow in Las Vegas. The tech security company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Robichaud said his goal is to get to a billion users. “We’ve grown really fast in the last 18 months faster than Dropbox and Evernote when they started, and teaming with Intel is our way of getting faster to a billion users,” said Robichaud in a phone interview, referring to other currently popular app-based service providers. PasswordBox last year secured $6 million in a Series A venture funding round led by OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, one of Canada’s largest pension funds with over C$65 billion ($57.40 billion) in net assets. “I think the speed of the transaction in this case speaks to the size of the market opportunity,” said Damien Steel, who is a director at OMERS Ventures and on the PasswordBox board. Steel noted that very few start-ups typically get bought out by a big industry player this early in their lifecycle. Intel’s acquisition of PasswordBox is effective immediately and all 48 employees of the start-up are now a part of the Intel Security Group. PasswordBox is the latest venture of Canadian entrepreneur and former radio host Robichaud. Back in 2010 he sold his earlier venture, a radio streaming service called StreamTheWorld to Triton Digital Media. "

2013-06-03,0,"* New models to be available globally this month SEOUL, June 3 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co  said on Monday it will use Intel Corp processors to power a new version of one of its top-tier Android tablets. Its decision to begin using Intel in a marquee Android device is a coup for the U.S. chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in. Samsung’s announcement confirms an earlier Reuters story and media reports on May 30. Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings  for its best-selling mobile devices. The South Korean firm unveiled two new tablets on Monday, an 8-inch tablet and the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1-inch, which uses Intel chips. The 10.1-inch tablet, which competes with Apple Inc’s  iPad, will be powered by Intel’s 1.6-GHz dual core processor and run the latest version of Google Inc’s  Android operating system. Intel called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but was slow to make chips that appealed to makers of smartphones and tablets as the market boomed following the release of Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and iPad in 2010. The new 10.1-inch tablet will support 3G and 4G network connections and the screen will have 1,280x800 resolution. Samsung said the new products will be available globally this month, but did not provide price details. "
2012-10-16,-14,"* PC shipments expected by analysts to decline slightly this year * Shares slide By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s weak outlook for fourth-quarter revenue and margins dispelled lingering hopes for a revival in PC demand towards the end of the year, pushing its shares 2 percent lower. Intel, along with rival Advanced Micro Devices, had previously warned of weak demand for PCs, hit by a troubled global economy and the growing popularity of tablets like Apple Inc’s iPad, once dismissed as a niche device but now leading a fundamental shift in consumer computing. Intel’s corporate-focused server and data center business has helped offset weak PC sales in recent quarters, but in the third quarter, revenue from that division also disappointed as enterprises bought fewer servers. “You have to remember, data center has been the rock we’ve all leaned on,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “It’s a reflection of enterprises and companies rationalizing their year-end spend.” With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. Intel said the data center business, which sells server chips and other equipment to companies and governments, grew 6 percent year over year in the third quarter, although it was down 5 percent from the prior quarter. Profitability will also take a hit, as Intel idles excess capacity at its plants in an effort to reduce inventories of its processors. It foresees fourth-quarter gross margins of 57 percent, or 58 percent on a non-GAAP basis, both plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 62 percent for the current quarter. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said about two-thirds of the anticipated decline in margins will come from excess capacity charges. Intel is also running its factories at less than 50 percent of their capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used on more cutting-edge production lines still being built. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. “I absolutely expect growth in the PC segment, and I firmly believe that the level of innovation we’re seeing in Ultrabooks is going to be one of the catalysts,” Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I‘m not going to put a number out there -but I expect it to grow.” Shares of Intel fell to $22.35 in after hours trade, after closing up 2.85 percent at $22.35. But in the fast-growing and cut-throat mobile world, Intel is struggling - its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may come back down to earth. The PC industry has been banking on Microsoft’s launch of Windows 8 later in October to breathe new life into laptops and slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. But there has been little sign of a significant bump in PC manufacturing or shipments ahead of the launch, at least in the short-term, analysts say. Intel estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $13.74 billion for the current quarter. In the third quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.23 billion in revenue for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings were $2.97 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared with $3.47 billion, or 65 cents a share in the same quarter last year."

In July 2011, InterDigital said it was looking into a possible sale of the company or its patents in the hope that other big patent deals would boost its value. “This should reduce some of the executional overhang that was on the stock. The market was worried they wouldn’t meet this milestone,” said M Partners analyst Ron Shuttleworth. “They lost a lot of credibility once they had to cancel the process.” However, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that the $220,000 price per patent that Intel agreed to pay appeared to be much lower than previously announced patent deals. In comparison, Rasgon cited Nortel’s $4.5 billion patent sale last year that fetched $750,000 per patent and Google Inc’s  recent $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, which implies a price of more than $735,000 per patent assuming a zero valuation for its cellphone hardware business. Rasgon said that the deal should fit well with Intel’s mobile strategy. “While we believe these new patents acquired from Interdigital should further bolster their position, we do not expect any changes to their wireless strategy as a result of the purchase,” Rasgon said in a research note. InterDigital also announced on Monday that its board had authorized a doubling of its share buyback authorization to $200 million from $100 million. It also said it was sticking by its revenue target of $71 million for the second quarter, including the sale of other patents for $9 million in a separate deal. The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter. Evercore Partners acted as InterDigital financial adviser and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich 7 Rosati acted as legal counsel. InterDigital shares were up $6.36 to $29.24 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. Intel shares, also on Nasdaq, rose 16 cents to $27.50."
2014-12-03,-2,"The world’s biggest eyewear maker said on Wednesday the frames developed with Intel would serve very specific purposes, and would not compete with its existing deal to manufacture and distribute Google Inc’s Internet-connected glasses. Intel is also involved in the Google Glass project as its chips will replace components from Texas Instruments in the new version of the “smart” spectacles, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. “We’ve started to work on sensors which can detect, say, temperature or location,” Luxottica Chief Executive Massimo Vian told Reuters, declining to give further details about the deal with Intel. “They provide their chips, we our brands,” he added. Luxottica’s brands include Ray Ban, Oakley and Persol, while it has licences to use brands including Chanel and Tiffany. Intel, which was late to the smartphone and tablet industries, is striving to be at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing and expand into new markets, including smart watches and other Internet-connected “wearables”. Earlier this year, it teamed up with watch retailer Fossil Group and fashion brand Opening Ceremony to develop wearable devices such as fashion bracelets with communications features and wireless charging. Intel and Luxottica gave no financial details about their  agreement, which will involve people from both companies working together in joint research and development teams. The first glasses are expected to be launched in 2015. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated last month that shipments of wearable devices would grow to 248 million units in 2017 from 6 million in 2013, more than double industry estimates. Vian, who took over as CEO in October after a management shake-up triggered by the exit of two top executives in as many months, said the Milan-based group had started looking at possible wearable technology ventures about 18 months ago. “Glasses with electronic components will feature in the future of the eyewear world,” he said.

2013-01-17,1,"* CEO says investing in new cutting-edge manufacturing tech * Analysts say PC doldrums may leave Intel with surplus capacity   (Adds detail on Cisco manufacturing deal) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  forecast quarterly revenue that disappointed Wall Street and a sharp increase in capital spending it plans for 2013 unnerved investors already concerned about slow demand for personal computers. Shares of the world’s leading chipmaker slid more than 5 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday after it projected this year’s capital spending at $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million, exceeding many analysts’ estimates for about $10 billion. Intel said $2 billion of its increased expenditures would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. Some analysts worried that with PC sales already slow, expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line. “People are starting to freak out about the capex,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them. They have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down.” Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would lower costs in the long run. “The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis,” Otellini told analysts on a conference call. “Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.” Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business, but he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies as long as that did not empower a rival. Intel has agreed to manufacture custom chips on behalf of networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. In the fourth quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp. PC makers are struggling to stop a decline in sales as consumers hold off on buying new laptops in favor of more nimble mobile gadgets. Microsoft’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 in October brought touchscreen features to laptops but failed to spark a resurgence in sales that Intel and many PC manufacturers had hoped for. Intel’s hefty investment plans reflect its confidence in the future, even as Wall Street worries about the chipmaker’s struggle to gain traction in the mobile market. “Our core advantage really is our manufacturing leadership,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “450 will give us a significant cost advantage relative to others.” Intel is expanding its research fab in Hillsboro, Oregon, to develop technology for manufacturing chips on 450 mm silicon wafers, a complicated step up from the current 300 mm wafer standard. Larger wafers can translate into big savings because more chips can be etched onto each of them. But building 450 mm plants is expected to be so expensive that only a few industry leaders, including Intel, Samsung Electronics and TSMC, are expected to have the necessary scale. Some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for expected operating efficiency this year. “The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. “I think it’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat to down.” Intel foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 56 percent for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It estimated a 2013 gross margin of 60 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. Analysts on average had expected 59 percent. Net earnings in the December quarter were $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, year-ago period. Analysts had expected 45 cents, and said the surprisingly strong performance was partly due to a lower effective tax rate of 23 percent. This was below Intel’s forecast of about 27 percent. Still, shares of Intel fell 5.6 percent in after-hours trade to $21.43, after closing up 2.58 percent at $22.68 on the Nasdaq. “This is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang and Steve Orlofsky)"
2016-01-14,-5,"The world’s largest chipmaker reported data center revenue of $4.31 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, missing consensus estimate of $4.42 billion, according to Jefferies & Co.  Revenue in the business rose only 4 percent from the preceding quarter, compared with the 8 percent growth in the third quarter. “I think companies are probably not upgrading their own data center as they know they are eventually going to convert to the cloud,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus and Co Inc. “So they are going to put Band-Aids on their current servers and not upgrade them,” Cassidy said. In October, Intel had cut its 2015 revenue growth forecast for the data center business, as companies slash spending due to weak macroeconomic growth. Excluding items, Intel forecast revenue of $14.1 billion, plus or minus $500 million for the first quarter ending March. The midpoint of this range is down 6 percent from the fourth quarter, the company said.   “While the outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution for overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016,” Krzanich said on a post-earnings call. Revenue in the personal computer business fell about 1 percent to $8.76 billion from a year earlier.  Global personal computer shipments fell 10.6 percent in the quarter ended in December from a year earlier, IDC said on Tuesday, the largest decline since the research firm started tracking PC shipments.    The fourth quarter of 2015 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of worldwide PC shipments decline, according to rival research firm Gartner.  Intel completed its $16.7 billion purchase of programmable-chip maker Altera Corp in December, a deal that adds a new class of products to Intel’s portfolio.

2014-06-12,-18,"The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. Judges at the Luxembourg-based General Court said on Thursday they backed the Commission’s decision. “The Commission demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that Intel attempted to conceal the anti-competitive nature of its practices and implemented a long term comprehensive strategy to foreclose AMD from the strategically most important sales channels,” the court said in a near 300-page decision. Judges said the EU watchdog had not been heavy-handed with the level of the fine, equal to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover, versus a possible maximum of 10 percent. While Commission penalties rarely hit the top figure, the rising level of fines is a source of worry for many companies. “The General Court considers that none of the arguments raised by Intel supports the conclusion that the fine imposed is disproportionate. On the contrary, it must be considered that that fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case,” judges said.  Intel, which can take its case further to the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law, declined to say whether it would do so. “We are very disappointed about the decision. It’s a complex case which is reflected in the decision. We will begin evaluating the decision,” Intel spokeswoman Sophie Jacobs said. “When large companies abuse their dominance of the market, it causes direct harm to consumers. The court’s ruling issued a strong reminder that such behaviour is illegal and unacceptable,” said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens. The court’s judgement suggests companies would be better off settling antitrust charges instead of fighting them, said Martina Maier, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery. “Companies under investigation by the Commission should not count on winning in court with the argument that the Commission would not have properly assessed the economic effects of an abuse of dominance,” she said. “This might well lead to a supplementary incentive for a company under investigation for an alleged abuse of dominance to settle with the Commission or to offer commitments in order to motivate the Commission to end its investigation.” Samsung recently settled EU charges while Google has also clinched a deal with the Commission.

2013-05-02,-6,"* Analysts say some would have preferred outsider * Previous CEO took flak for missing mobile revolution By Noel Randewich and Sinead Carew SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  chose veteran insider Brian Krzanich as chief executive, disappointing some investors who hoped an outsider would push for aggressive changes to help the world’s largest chipmaker catch up in the mobile revolution. The company also announced on Thursday that software honcho Renée James, 48, had been elevated to the post of president. Her appointment signaled to some that Intel, while likely intending to stick with its formula of intense investment to keep it ahead in the microchip technology game, is willing to explore new growth areas. The company said last November that it might go external for its next CEO, raising hopes that it might find someone to shake it out of recent doldrums. Seen as a frontrunner for the job since November, Krzanich inherits a company with margins of almost 60 percent that has all but extinguished rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in the past few years, and is now the dominant maker of microprocessors for computers and servers. But the company is in danger of finding itself sidelined as mobile devices such as tablets and ever more powerful smartphones accelerate a contraction of the personal computer market. The majority of gadgets today run processors based on rival ARM Holdings Plc’s power-saving chip architecture. “An external candidate might have been a better choice - with no negative reflection on Brian - simply because of the juncture Intel is at with what’s happening in the PC market and the need to take major action outside of PCs,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “Brian may very well come in and make those same very difficult dramatic choices, but it’s less likely.” He will take on the top job at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 16, replacing Paul Otellini. A relative unknown outside the tight-knit semiconductor industry, Krzanich has worked at Intel since 1982, rising to chief operating officer just over a year ago. The 52-year-old has earned a reputation for being a decisive leader who liked to keep a low profile. Intel on Thursday stressed that he will have a strong partner in James, who in 2011 spearheaded Intel’s $7.7 billion acquisition of No. 2 security software firm McAfee Inc. She ran software product and service sales as well as a team of engineers focused on improving the performance of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 and Google Inc’s Android software when run on the company’s microchips. Her elevation “puts emphasis on the many businesses Intel is in beyond just chips. This is an important promotion, and it clearly signals the board wants to make Intel a much broader company,” said Jack Gold, who runs research outfit Jack Gold Associates. Intel shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $24.11 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Over the past few months, media reports have mentioned several possible external candidates including Sanjay Jha, former head of Motorola’s mobile device division. Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said Krzanich is capable of effecting a transformational move. But he also said Krzanich and James made for an “extremely powerful” partnership, and that the pair had co-developed a long-term strategic vision for the company that won the board over. “They formed a partnership through the last few months that has blossomed into an extremely powerful pair,” he said. “You’ll see a fairly dramatic change over a period of time,” Bryant told Reuters in an interview. “If you look at Intel’s past, with every CEO we’ve had that.” Krzanich’s appointment comes at a crucial time for the company, which is gearing up for a transition in manufacturing processes to larger, 450 millimeter wafers, a gradual migration that may eventually trim production costs but which requires spending billions of dollars to upgrade facilities. And it is scrambling to finalize and launch next-generation processors - code-named “Haswell” - that it hopes will cut down on power consumption and close the gap with ARM-based rival chips, popular among mobile users who prioritize battery life. A chemical engineer by training who went to school in Northern California, Krzanich started with Intel in New Mexico as a process engineer before moving on to a series of factory management positions. He holds a patent for semiconductor processing and sits on the board of an industry association. He told Reuters in a 2012 interview his best work during his three-decade career included shortening turnaround times in the chipmaker’s factories. Intel announced in November that it was looking for a new CEO as Otellini announced plans to retire. The Santa Clara, California, company came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand. The company, which once said emerging markets could offset a dropoff in developed-world demand, orchestrated a push on pricey “Ultrabook” laptops that has so far failed to excite consumers. Last month, Intel warned that current-quarter revenue would fall as much as 8 percent, given the drop in PC sales. The company affirmed its full-year revenue growth target, but analysts think that forecast will be hard to hit. “Some investors preferred an external option on the belief that new blood was needed,” said Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann. But “the appointment is an indication that Intel will continue Paul Otellini’s strategy of building bigger, better fabs to attack the market.”"

2015-01-15,0,"By Anya George Tharakan and Bill Rigby Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp forecast revenue and gross margins for this quarter that disappointed investors, sending its shares down 2.7 percent in extended trading. Revenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter, raising doubts about a long-anticipated recovery of the personal computer business. Global PC shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines. That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize, but Intel did not deliver any spirited talk about a recovery on Thursday. “In 2015 we’re predicting kind of flat, nothing spectacular but stable, is how I would call it,” Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters in an interview. Despite the tepid PC market, Intel is targeting revenue growth this year in the “mid-single digit percentage points”, which Smith said would be helped by faster growth in providing chips for data centers and Internet-connected gadgets. Optimism over a PC recovery has propelled Intel’s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P 500, to levels not seen since 2001. In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. “The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. “PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,” Rolland added. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Intel’s third-quarter report on Tuesday followed a warning by the top chipmaker in September that demand was weaker than expected and that revenue would fall far short of its forecast. With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. Intel said fourth-quarter gross margins would be 57 percent, or 58 percent non-GAAP, both plus or minus a couple of percentage points.

Like a boomerang, it returns to its owner and then syncs with the owner’s smartphone. Falling behind Qualcomm in recent years after it was slow to embrace smartphones and tablets, Intel has been keen to make sure its processors are at the front of future technology trends. CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the “Make it Wearable” contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel’s chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market. “This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,” Krzanich said at an award event on Monday. “The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas.” Finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers, and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn-by-turn directions so they don’t need to look at their smartphones. Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands, but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers. Apple plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015. Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis. It also has teamed up on other wrist-worn gadgets with Fossil and Opening Ceremony. Krzanich, a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 Land Cruiser in his free time, is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets.

A spokesman for Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said the source of the leak was a single manufacturing tool in one of the company’s silicon wafer fabrication facilities. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the tool that caused the leak has been taken offline and operations at the plant have resumed as the company tries to determine the cause of the malfunction. “There is no ongoing danger,” Mulloy said. Dwiggins said there was no threat to nearby neighborhoods. “They monitored the air inside and outside the structure and in all cases the air was clean,” he said. The plant manufactures silicon wafers used to make semiconductors for computers. The components are made on 12 inch (30.5 cm) silicon wafers that are later sliced into individual components, according to the spokesman. Each component can contain more than a billion transistors. Mulloy and Dwiggins said 43 people were treated at the scene, and as many as 11 individuals were taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Those transported to hospitals were suffering from conditions including difficulty breathing, nausea and skin and eye irritation, said Dwiggins. About 75 firefighters were called to the campus early on Saturday after a worker complained of difficulty breathing and then others began experiencing symptoms, Dwiggins said.

2012-11-19,3,"* Otellini has been CEO since 2005 * Intel says CEO search could take six months * Chipmaker promotes three executives * Intel’s dominant position has slipped as PC sales dwindle By Noel Randewich and Liana B. Baker SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  said on Monday that Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will retire in May as the world’s leading chipmaker grapples with weak PC demand and an industry shift toward mobile computing. Intel’s board said it would consider internal and external candidates for the CEO position and it expected the “leadership transition” to last six months. Intel, whose processors are dominant in personal computers, has been slow to expand into the fast-growing mobile industry where Apple’s iPads and iPhones, and other popular mobile devices, are made using competing technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings. “We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now. It’s the era of Intel versus ARM, so it may be good to come in with some fresh blood and a new perspective,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. The company said it would promote three executives to  executive vice presidents. They are Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Brian Krzanich, who is chief operating officer and oversees manufacturing; and Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer and director of corporate strategy. Smith, well-known by Wall Street, and Krzanich have in the past been viewed as potential future CEOs. “There a comfort level with Stacy (Smith),” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. “I think we’d get more continuity with the current roadmap and direction than you would with anybody else‘s.” Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, made a name for himself improving the efficiency of the chipmaker’s cutting-edge factories. He was promoted to Chief Operating Officer last March, effectively throwing him in the running for the CEO position. Analysts said James’ focus on software instead of hardware made her less likely to be promoted to CEO. “Previous CEO transitions have all involved carefully groomed internal candidates, but if Intel’s Board is now looking externally -- to bring in new skills -- that would explain the lack of a named successor and length of time in transition,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. Otellini, 62, was the company’s fifth CEO, stepping into the post in the second quarter of 2005. The company has an internal rule of retiring its CEOs at age 65. He worked at Intel for nearly 40 years -- most of its history. The Santa Clara, California company has long been accustomed to being king of the PC market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors to be used in smartphones and tablets that depend on batteries. Its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leads some investors, who are already concerned about a lackluster global economy, to ask if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end and whether the company’s potential for profit and revenue growth may be limited. Intel’s shares gained 0.5 percent to $20.28 in Nasdaq trading.    (Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco, Liana B.

2012-07-17,-14,"* Quarterly EPS 54 cents * Stock edges lower   (Adds details on PC market) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp  forecast weak current-quarter revenues, reinforcing fears that a wavering global economy and a lack of consumer interest are dampening personal computer sales. Shaky economies in Europe and the United States and a growing consumer preference for Apple Inc’s iPad tablets have been taking a toll on the PC industry. The world’s leading chipmaker cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth”. That put Intel’s outlook in line with many investors’ recently reduced expectations and helped cushion an initial sell-off of its stock. “As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched,” said Craig Ellis, an analyst at Caris & Company. “The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance - but they didn‘t.” Fears that global PC sales may be worse than expected have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April. They have recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. Helping fuel fears of a PC slowdown, smaller Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices last week slashed its outlook for second-quarter revenue on disappointing sales in Europe and China, where economic growth has recently lost some steam. China and other emerging markets have been a key source of growth in recent quarters, helping make up for weakness in the Europe and the United States. Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC, said Intel’s forecast for the current quarter was less than typical for this time of year. “Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent and Intel’s guidance is comfortably below that,” he said. Intel supplies processors for 80 percent of the world’s PCs but it has yet to make significant progress in fast-growing tablets or smartphones, products that use chips based on technology from British-based ARM Holdings. Intel is heavily promoting a new category of “ultrabook” laptops with premium features like solid-state drives that it hopes will add some zest to a PC market that some see as lackluster compared to tablets and smartphones. Many analysts are concerned the touch screens and other high-end features on upcoming ultrabooks, made by Dell Inc , Asus, Hewlett-Packard Co and others will make them too expensive for some consumers. Short-term PC sales may suffer as some consumers consider putting off new purchases until Microsoft launches its new Windows 8 operating system, expected in October. Intel said revenue in the second quarter was $13.5 billion, up from $13.03 billion in the year-ago period and lower than the $13.56 billion expected. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $14.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GAAP net income in the second quarter was $2.8 billion, down from $2.95 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 54 cents. Analysts had expected 52 cents. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter were  64 percent. Intel maintained its full-year gross margin forecast of 64 percent. Shares of Intel fell 1.5 percent in extended trading before paring losses. It had ended about 1 percent higher at $25.38 on Nasdaq. "
2013-04-16,-2,"Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, that amounts to roughly no change or a drop of as much as 8 percent. Analysts had expected $12.588 billion in revenue for the first quarter and $12.854 billion for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel posted first-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.74 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period.

2014-12-03,-2,"Intel is also involved in the Google Glass project as its chips will replace components from Texas Instruments in the new version of the “smart” spectacles, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. “We’ve started to work on sensors which can detect, say, temperature or location,” Luxottica Chief Executive Massimo Vian told Reuters, declining to give further details about the deal with Intel.  “They provide their chips, we our brands,” he added.  Luxottica’s brands include Ray Ban, Oakley and Persol, while it has licenses to use brands including Chanel and Tiffany.   Intel, which was late to the smartphone and tablet industries, is striving to be at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing and expand into new markets, including smart watches and other Internet-connected “wearables”. Earlier this year, it teamed up with watch retailer Fossil Group and fashion brand Opening Ceremony to develop wearable devices such as fashion bracelets with communications features and wireless charging.     Intel and Luxottica gave no financial details about their  agreement, which will involve people from both companies working together in joint research and development teams. The first glasses are expected to be launched in 2015. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated last month that shipments of wearable devices would grow to 248 million units in 2017 from 6 million in 2013, more than double industry estimates. Vian, who took over as CEO in October after a management shake-up triggered by the exit of two top executives in as many months, said the Milan-based group had started looking at possible wearable technology ventures about 18 months ago. “Glasses with electronic components will feature in the future of the eyewear world,” he said.

2014-05-18,2,"The timing of new chip rollouts is important to Intel and manufacturers looking to sell new PCs with better battery life and higher speeds. “I can guarantee for holiday, and not at the last second of holiday,” Krzanich said in an interview. “Back to school - that’s a tight one. Back to school you have to really have it on-shelf in July, August. That’s going to be tough.” Krzanich’s comments were more precise than during Intel’s most recent quarterly conference call with analysts in April. On that call, he said he expected Intel’s customers to launch Broadwell-based products in the second half of 2014. The back-to-school season around August, when parents sometimes buy new PCs for their children, has provided smaller sales bumps for PC makers in recent years than in the past, but the November/December U.S. holiday season is still viewed as a key opportunity to sell consumer electronics.

2015-01-15,-3,"By Anya George Tharakan and Bill Rigby Jan 15 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp forecast current-quarter revenue and gross margins that disappointed investors, sending its shares down more than 2 percent in extended trading. Revenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the third, raising doubts about the expected recovery of the personal computer business. Global personal computer shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines. That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize. That optimism has helped drive Intel’s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P 500, to levels not seen since 2001. In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. “The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. “PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,” Rolland added. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite exceeding the goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year, the heavy subsidies that Intel offered added to its operating loss in its mobile business. Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $3.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 27, from $2.6 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.

2016-03-15,7,"The 40 finalists faced a final competition in Washington before announcement of the winners at a black-tie dinner, according to the Society for Science and the Public, which runs the event. The winners in three categories - basic research, global good and innovation - will each receive $150,000, it said in a statement. Second-place finishers will each get $75,000, and third-place prizes are $35,000. Amol Punjabi, 17, of Marlborough, Massachusetts, won the basic research category for developing software that may help drug makers to create new cancer and heart disease therapies. Paige Brown, 17, of Bangor, Maine, studied water quality of six local streams high in E. Coli and phosphate contamination levels and led the global good category. And 17-year-old Maya Varma of Cupertino, California, won the innovation category by creating a low-cost, smartphone-based tool to diagnose respiratory illnesses as accurately as expensive models used in medical laboratories. Other finalists’ projects include an encryption system with applications in cybersecurity, research on nanomedicine aimed at destroying blood clots that can cause heart attacks, and improved concrete seals for undersea oil wells, the society said. The finalists are from 38 schools in 18 states. Two schools had two finalists apiece - Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science in Worcester, Massachusetts. Fifty-two percent of the finalists are female, a first in the program’s 75-year history. “This milestone is an inspiring sign of progress toward closing the gender gap in technology and engineering,” said Rosalind Hudnell, president of the Intel Foundation. “We hope these finalists’ outstanding work will inspire young people from all backgrounds to develop their interests in these fields.” Past participants have received some of the world’s top science honors, including 12 Nobel Prizes, 11 National Medals of Science and 18 MacArthur Foundation Fellowships.

2013-01-07,-1,"“Absolutely all-day battery life where you just don’t have to bring your power brick at all anymore,” Kirk Skaugen, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group, said of laptops built with the company’s upcoming Haswell processor. While macroeconomic troubles have weighed on sales for several quarters, the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones is seen as an existential threat to the PC industry. Anxious to breathe new life into PCs and prove a recent slump in sales is not permanent, Intel and PC manufactures in Las Vegas this week will display a range of ultra thin laptops, dubbed Ultrabooks, and hybrid devices that convert into tablets. On a stage flanked by dozens of tablets and laptops with rotatable and detachable screens, Skaugen said Intel’s newly available chip based on its current Ivy Bridge architecture sips just 7 watts of energy, more efficient than a previously planned 10 watts of power. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, a fast-growing market led by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. Mike Bell, who co-heads Intel’s mobile and wireless business, introduced a new processor platform, code named Lexington, targeted at low-priced smartphones in emerging markets like Latin America and Asia. Acer, Safaricom and Lava have already agreed to use the new chips in future phones, Bell said. A handful of manufacturers and telecom carriers in Europe and Asia have already launched smartphones using Intel’s Medfield processors this year. Google’s Motorola Mobility in September launched the Razr i in Europe and Latin America as the first handset of a multi-device agreement between the two groups. Sales of smartphone processors soared 58 percent in the third quarter, but Intel had just 0.2 percent of that market, according to a recent report from Strategy Analytics. By comparison, worldwide PC shipments fell 8.6 percent in the third quarter, according to IDC. Intel said 3D cameras would be integrated in future Ultrabooks to allow consumers to use gestures and facial recognition to control their devices. Upcoming Ultrabooks will also include voice interaction, Skaugen said. “We’re basically going to give the PC the same human senses we’ve all had,” he said. Intel and other tech companies are increasingly looking for ways to let PCs and other devices use cameras, GPS chips, microphones and other kinds of sensors to predict their users’ needs. “It’s this combination of computer devices doing things before you ask them to do it, in that they’re smart enough to know based on their sensors,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. "
2013-01-17,3,"Intel said $2 billion of its increased spending would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. But some analysts worried that expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line if it has to idle plants. “People are starting to freak out about the capex,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “They are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what’s going to drive it?” “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down,” Rasgon said. Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would suppress costs in the long run. “The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis,” Otellini told analysts on a conference call. “Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.” Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business. But he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies - as long as that did not empower a rival. In the fourth quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion for the current quarter. Intel is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft which has led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp. PC makers are struggling to stop a decline in sales as consumers hold off on buying new laptops in favor of spending on more nimble mobile gadgets. Microsoft Corp’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 in October brought touchscreen features to laptops but failed to spark a resurgence in sales that Intel and many PC manufacturers had hoped for. However, some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for operating efficiency. “The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. “I think it’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down.” It foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 56 percent for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It estimated a 2013 gross margin of 60 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. Analysts on average had expected 59 percent. Net earnings in the December quarter were $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, year-ago period. Analysts had expected 45 cents, and said the surprisingly strong performance was partly due to a lower effective tax rate of 23 percent. This was below Intel’s forecast of about 27 percent. Still, shares of Intel fell 5.6 percent in after hours trade to $21.43, after closing up 2.58 percent at $22.68 on Nasdaq. “This is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital. "

2012-09-27,-4,"Intel initially brushed off any threat from tablets such as Apple Inc’s iPad, but now hopes the combination of a low power consuming processor with touch friendly Microsoft Corp Windows 8 software will win over enterprise customers looking to deploy tablets, but keep PC-based software and hardware. The world’s largest chip maker says the “Atom Z2760” - formerly code named “Clover Trail” - is tailored to work with the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system, due in late October. Tablets that use both the Atom and Widows 8 will be able to run widely used software such as Word and Excel, while connecting to peripherals such as printers. It also lengthens battery life, enabling tablets to run 10-plus hours of streaming high-definition video, said Intel applications processor division chief Eric Reid. Targeting corporations and government agencies means the first wave of Intel-powered tablets and tablet-laptop hybrids will avoid the worst of the consumer war now raging between Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc. “These new Atom-based tablets have been targeted at spaces where Intel and Microsoft can win, the enterprise market, and as an alternative to a notebook,” said Patrick Moorhead, head of Moor Insights and Strategy. Dell Inc, Acer Inc, Asustek Computer Inc  and ZTE Corp round out the half-dozen PC makers that trotted out their upcoming tablets, some of which sport a detachable keyboard or stylus designed to support free-form drawing and writing. “Every tablet shown today does what neither an iPad or  Kindle Fire HD does well, which is creating content and controlling via a keyboard and trackpad,” he said. “This provides differentiation while not going head to head with Apple and Amazon.” With PC sales expected to stagnate over the next year or two, Intel hopes to make up for lost time and regain market share ceded to rivals such as Qualcomm Inc, Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp, whose applications processors now power most tablets except the iPad. Although the “Intel Inside” sticker remains affixed to 80 percent of the world’s PCs, the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. Analysts say the semiconductor industry leader has woken up to the tablet threat only in the past year. It is now rushing into the mobile market, motivated in part by slowing PC sales across consumer, businesses and even the emerging market segments it once relied on to propel sales. This month, it cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by a more than expected 8 percent and withdrew its full-year outlook entirely. Intel’s tablet strategy so far has focused on Windows 8 and its “x86” architecture found in most of the world’s PCs. But executives said this month that tablets running their processors and based on Google’s Android software are also in the works. Microsoft’s main assault on the tablet market involves Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 that works off the ARM Holdings chip designs that now dominate the market and drive the iPad and other mobile devices."

2013-12-12,-2,"* Intel name to be revealed during goal celebrations * Deal worth $25 million over 4 1/2 years, media say BARCELONA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Barcelona have agreed a sponsorship deal with Intel under which the chipmaker’s logo will be printed on the inside of players’ shirts, the Spanish champions announced on Thursday. The idea behind the unusual positioning of the “Intel Inside” logo is that it will be revealed when a player lifts his shirt to celebrate scoring a goal, Barca officials told a news conference in the Catalan capital. Players including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta would be under no obligation to display the logo, which will be added to the shirts for the first time in Saturday’s La Liga match at home to Villarreal, Manel Arroyo, a club director responsible for media and sponsorship, said. Arroyo declined to reveal how much the deal - which runs for four and a half years and includes an option for an extension - was worth, saying it was “confidential”. Spanish media and Forbes magazine, without identifying the source of their information, reported Intel would pay Barca $25 million. As part of their first foray into soccer sponsorship, Intel will also provide technology to players and coaching staff as well as the recruits at Barca’s academy, officials said. Deborah Conrad, Intel’s chief marketing officer, said the decision to partner with Barca had been taken after a search for suitable “passion points” that the company hoped to tap into to help connect them with consumers. Barca have one of the most active social media communities in sport as well as hundreds of millions of fans around the world, Conrad noted. “We did not want to put the players under any obligation to show the logo a specific number of times but we do know that such goal celebrations are a big part of the culture of the sport,” she told Reuters by telephone. She also declined to reveal how much the deal was worth. Barca’s main sponsors include sporting goods manufacturer Nike, carmaker Audi, and the airline Qatar Airways, whose logo will remain on the outside of the players’ shirts."

There are not enough catalysts to push revenues up.” ”Which is why to me that number gives us confirmation that they’re planning to really ramp their foundry business this year. ”A lot of folks had expected Intel to really be in line or even below. ”Revenue guidance of kind of low single digits and GM guidance of 60 percent is about 100 bps higher than the street. ”It means that we’re not going to continue to slide lower. PCs really degraded over the course of 2012, and the guidance and the numbers they giving us here probably means that we’ve hit the bottom, we’re seeing stability, and we should start to see some growth shortly. “We’ll see what happens. Intel has really not been all that accurate in their long-term forecasts. But it signifies that they feel more comfortable with the PC landscape.” ”It seems like PCs were slightly lower than we expected. It seems like they slightly under-shipped the market. They’re up 7 percent in the more profitable server market. ”First quarter seems like it’s going to be slightly lower than what the Street was anticipating, but we think again that’s weakness in PCs, and some in servers, in the first quarter. Looks like their guidance for the year is very strong with 60 percent gross margins -- that would be up from 58 percent in Q1. ”It seems like they’re positive and they think they’re going to grow in the low single digits. That’s because we think, in the second half of 2013, we expect to see growth in the PC market. ”It’s the best tool in Intel’s toolbox: their manufacturing. ”They’re going to push forward and that separates them from their competitors and allows them to come out with lower-power, higher-performance processors in the future. ”Some of these new PCs that are coming out are innovative and can actually start taking back some high-end or $700 tablets. We think that if you get a full PC that is convertible to look like a tablet with touch, we think that’s a very compelling product. The results show that the “PC industry is still around and maybe it was slightly exaggerated that the death of the PC was here.” ”The Q4 beat looks like the tax rate. Gross margins came in slightly better than expected.

The good thing is they are looking at pretty decent margins: a couple hundred basis points for the full year. The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line. ”It’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down.

The company will use the funds to accelerate product development and support marketing. “Seagate’s investment ... will help us to bring our products to customers earlier,” Reduxio Chief Executive Officer Mark Weiner said. Reduxio’s product is expected to begin selling in the middle of 2015. As enterprises transition from hard disk drive-based storage (HDD) to flash-memory solid state drives (SSD), Reduxio has developed a hybrid system that integrates the two technologies. Data is saved on the appropriate technology based on importance or availability. This also reduces the costs as HDD is cheaper than flash memory SSD.  "

McAfee has previously lost its chief executive along with other key executives in technology development, research and sales. The company named Asia Pacific sales chief Steve Redman to replace Sexton, who could not be reached for a comment. McAfee said in a statement that Sexton was taking a “leadership role in a non-competing technology company.” The company also named Penny Baldwin executive vice president and chief marketing officer. She was previously acting CMO and senior vice president of global brand strategy and marketing at Yahoo Inc. She replaced David Milam, who left in mid-September to join privately held software maker Five9 Inc, according to McAfee spokesman Ian Bain. The management changes come a month after a McAfee spokesman disclosed that the company planned to lay off “a small percentage” of its approximately 7,100 employees. Bain declined to comment on Tuesday on the progress of those layoffs."
2013-05-03,-10,"To turn around the $53 billion-a-year empire, Krzanich will have to depend on trusted lieutenants, something he shouldn’t have a problem doing, say former employees, analysts and industry executives who have worked with him. In 2010, Krzanich was on the brink of a weighty decision: whether to break with tradition and open up Intel’s top-secret manufacturing facilities and make chips for other companies. He called a teleconference of 8-10 key people - executives from marketing, investor relations and sales among them - and began firing off questions. He wanted to know if going ahead with the manufacturing deal could create any potential problems for other areas within Intel, like upsetting major customers or creating misunderstandings on Wall Street about Intel’s core strategies. “His job was to say, Can we do it economically and make money in our factory? But he was really good about making sure the supply-chain guys, the marketing guys, everyone kind of understood the impact of (the potential deal),” one of the people on the conference call told Reuters. In less than an hour, he took a decision that would pave the way toward a new business for Intel: Achronix became its first foundry customer. This past February, Altera Corp became its first major client for the business, and industry insiders believe it could eventually reach a similar deal with Apple. At a company known in Silicon Valley for its insular culture, Krzanich went largely unnoticed by investors and media even as he rose through the ranks to senior positions. Two former longtime employees said that when they left Intel less than a decade ago, they had never even heard of Krzanich, though he was then in charge of the company’s assembly and test facilities. The new CEO is a mystery even to some of the best-connected of the chip industry elite. Paul Jacobs, CEO of No. 2 U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, said on Thursday he looked forward to meeting Krzanich. The San Jose State University graduate, who declined to comment for this story, has an engaged but quiet management style, although an employee said engineers who miss their deadlines or targets tend not to stay in positions of responsibility. When Krzanich was promoted to chief operating officer last year, Intel pushed him into the public spotlight, exposing him a little more to the media. Given a choice between speaking to an investor or a reporter, Krzanich will choose the investor every time, another Intel employee who knows him well said. As recently as a few years ago he was known to drive just an ordinary car, and in January arrived at an investor meeting in Las Vegas wearing work boots. One of the former Intel employees described Krzanich as the worst-dressed guy in a meeting, “but in a good way.” “He doesn’t worry too much about the impression he leaves with you. But you pay attention to what he has to say,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. People who have dealt with “B.K.,” his handle inside the company, describe him as well aware of own limitations outside of manufacturing, like dealing with customers, but willing to consult with trusted others and make quick decisions based on their recommendations. Perhaps for that reason, Intel Chairman Andy Bryant on Thursday stressed that the new CEO will work closely with new president and former software honcho, Renee James, and team up to push new markets, including smartphones and tablets. After becoming COO, Krzanich told Reuters in a March 2012 interview that he had devoted a couple of years to learning to manage the product-design engineers outside of Intel’s factories. “Managing them like the factory would be one of the worst things I could do for Intel. They need creativity. It’s very different from the factory role.” Krzanich seems to play well with others. He stood out at an offsite executive-training course he attended for several days around a decade ago, according to two consultants who helped organize it. “When you observed him on the team working with his peers he was a leader, but not because he was a dominating, hard-ass guy. He was a good team player,” said Noel Tichy, who is also a business professor at the University of Michigan. “What Brian brought was a level of depth. He went deep on the data. I remember conversations with him about his analysis, and moving the team through the analytic phase of the work. He had an opportunity to really help shape some of the team’s thinking,” said consultant Chris DeRose. Krzanich began his Intel career soon after college at a chip factory in New Mexico in 1982. He acquired responsibility for his first factory, in Chandler, Arizona, in 1996. After running the company’s assembly and testing facilities, in 2007 he was put in charge of the global network of factories as well as the chipmaker’s supply chain. His promotion to COO in January last year added human resources and IT to his responsibilities. CEOs Mark Durcan of Micron Technology and Mike Splinter of Applied Materials on Thursday lauded Krzanich for his profound knowledge of the industry. One reservation was voiced by Henri Richard, senior vice president of commercial sales at SanDisk and a former executive of Intel rival AMD. Making changes to long-held Intel practices, he said, may be one of Krzanich’s biggest challenges because of loyalty to the old guard. “He’s going to fall in the category of ‘not a bad choice’,” said Richard, who has never met Krzanich. “But I think the market had appetite for the implied bigger change that would have come with an external CEO.” "

2013-06-29,-7,"One of the buildings at the sprawling processing plant was evacuated after the leak of gas, which was identified as nitrogen triflouride, said Battalion Chief Tom Dwiggins, a fire department spokesman. A spokesman for Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said the source of the leak was a single manufacturing tool in one of the company’s silicon wafer fabrication facilities. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the tool that caused the leak has been taken offline and operations at the plant have resumed as the company tries to determine the cause of the malfunction. “There is no ongoing danger,” Mulloy said. Dwiggins said there was no threat to nearby neighborhoods. “They monitored the air inside and outside the structure and in all cases the air was clean,” he said. The plant manufactures silicon wafers used to make semiconductors for computers. The components are made on 12 inch silicon wafers that are later sliced into individual components, according to the spokesman. Each component can contain more than a billion transistors. Mulloy and Dwiggins said 43 people were treated at the scene, and as many as 11 individuals were taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Those transported to hospitals were suffering from conditions including difficulty breathing, nausea and skin and eye irritation, said Dwiggins. About 75 firefighters were called to the campus early on Saturday after a worker complained of difficulty breathing and then others began experiencing symptoms, Dwiggins said. The plant in Chandler employs about 11,000 people. Intel operates two high-volume semiconductor manufacturing facilities at the site and is building a third facility, which is scheduled to open this year, according to the company website. "
2014-11-17,0,"Called My Intelligent Communication Accessory, or MICA, the snakeskin bracelets are aimed at fashion-conscious women and are an attempt by the two companies to stand out in a growing field of often-clunky smartwatches and fitness brands that have yet to catch on widely with consumers. “We really approached this first and foremost about why would a woman want to wear this everyday, and how can it be incorporated into her wardrobe,” Humberto Leon, creative director at Opening Ceremony, said in a phone interview last week. As well as lapis stones, obsidian and an 18k gold coating, the devices include a sapphire curved screen on the inside of the wrist that displays text messages, calendar items and events from Google and Facebook, and recommendations of nearby restaurants and stores from Yelp. After Intel was late to smartphones and tablets in recent years, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has been determined to make sure the top chipmaker is at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing. Krzanich gave the green light for the chipmaker to develop the bracelet with Opening Ceremony after his wife wore a prototype for several days and liked it, he recently said. Incoming alerts discreetly vibrate the bracelet instead of making a noise. Its $495 price tag includes a two-year data plan with AT&T, which means it does not rely on a smartphone for connectivity, as do most smartwatches, the companies said in a press release on Monday. As well as working with Opening Ceremony, Intel in March bought fitness bracelet maker Basis Science and it has teamed up with watch retailer Fossil Group to develop other wearable computing devices. The bracelets, which Intel says have a battery life up to two days, will be sold starting by early December through Opening Ceremony and Barney’s upscale department stores.

2013-04-16,-2,"* Maintains full-year revenue forecast * Shares edge lower By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said its current-quarter revenue would decline as much as 8 percent and trimmed its 2013 capital spending plans, as personal computer sales drop due to the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones. Shares in the world’s largest chip maker rallied as much as 3 percent after hours but quickly gave up the gains. The stock had been battered over the past week after researcher IDC revealed that PC sales notched a record quarterly decline in the first quarter. Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, that amounts to roughly no change or a drop of as much as 8 percent. Analysts had expected $12.588 billion in revenue for the first quarter and $12.854 billion for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel posted first-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.74 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected 41 cents per share. “These numbers are not very solid, but the second-quarter guidance is better than feared. Conditions are probably not as bad as industry reports have suggested recently,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital. Shares of Intel edged down less than 1 percent in extended trade after closing up 2.5 percent at $21.91 on Nasdaq."
2013-01-17,3,"* CEO says investing in new cutting-edge wafer fab * Analysts say PC doldrums may leave Intel with surplus capacity   (Adds details from conference call) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  current-quarter revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street, while a sharp rise in planned 2013 capital spending unnerved investors who expect personal computer demand to dwindle. Shares of the world’s leading chipmaker slid more than 5 percent after it projected 2013 capital spending at $13 billion - plus or minus $500 million - exceeding many analysts’ estimates for about $10 billion. Intel said $2 billion of its increased spending would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. But some analysts worried that expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line if it has to idle plants. “People are starting to freak out about the capex,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “They are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what’s going to drive it?” “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down,” Rasgon said. Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would suppress costs in the long run. “The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis,” Otellini told analysts on a conference call. “Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.” Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business. But he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies - as long as that did not empower a rival. In the fourth quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion for the current quarter. Intel is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft which has led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp. PC makers are struggling to stop a decline in sales as consumers hold off on buying new laptops in favor of spending on more nimble mobile gadgets. Microsoft Corp’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 in October brought touchscreen features to laptops but failed to spark a resurgence in sales that Intel and many PC manufacturers had hoped for. However, some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for operating efficiency. “The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. “I think it’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down.” It foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 56 percent for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It estimated a 2013 gross margin of 60 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. Analysts on average had expected 59 percent. Net earnings in the December quarter were $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, year-ago period. Analysts had expected 45 cents, and said the surprisingly strong performance was partly due to a lower effective tax rate of 23 percent. This was below Intel’s forecast of about 27 percent. Still, shares of Intel fell 5.6 percent in after hours trade to $21.43, after closing up 2.58 percent at $22.68 on Nasdaq. “This is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang)"

2015-03-19,-1,"By Astrid Wendlandt BASEL, Switzerland, March 19 (Reuters) - Tag Heuer, French luxury group LVMH’s biggest watch maker, said it will launch a smartwatch later this year using Google Inc’s  Android operating system in a venture with Intel Corp  to compete head-on with the Apple Watch. Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver declined to give any details about pricing, functionality or design, but said on Thursday that it aimed to launch what would be the first Android luxury smartwatch in the fourth quarter. The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model. It is the company’s first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors. The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets. “We believe wearable technology will take off,” Michael Bell, vice president of Intel’s New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair. Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica, watchmaker Fossil, and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony. “Tag Heuer’s decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said. “With Apple Watch hitting the market it’s no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.” Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group Kering gave no details of pricing or launch timing. Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however. Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch. “The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,” he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday. Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.

2014-02-23,-4,"Analysts predicted that competition could intensify this year among telecom equipment vendors after Nokia’s NSN unit forecast lower operating margins as it tries to rebuild revenues lost after a bout of restructuring. A newly aggressive NSN could spark reactions from Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei. “All the players in the sector have understood that competition based on price was not the right answer,” Combes said on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress, the wireless industry’s largest annual conference. “Differentiation is the right way. Each company must find its areas of excellence and deliver on the services promised to customers,” he said. NSN Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said on Sunday that the group would not compete aggressively on price across the board, despite its aim to return to revenue growth by the second half of the year. “It’s about being selective and targeted on pricing,” he said at a press conference. At Alcatel’s event, Combes unveiled a partnership with chip maker Intel under which the two will share the costs of research and development on cloud computing and security. Known as network function virtualization, the technology allows telecom operators to rely more on software to run their networks and less on hardware, which can over time bring down costs. Other telecom gear makers are also pitching such products. NSN said it had carried out over 50 commercial trials with carriers to explore such cloud technology. The Intel accord is the second R&D partnership announced since Combes took over as CEO in April 2012, and he pledged more to come. Mobile chip maker Qualcomm took an undisclosed stake in Alcatel in July 2013 as part of a research partnership on so-called small cells, which are small mobile antennas to help operators cover urban areas. The Intel partnership does not involve any direct purchase of Alcatel’s shares, but Combes said the two would invest “several hundred million euros each” with the aim of possibly launching products for sale this year. “We can be first to market with products by working with partners,” said Combes. Alcatel-Lucent halved its net loss last year as Combes’ turnaround plan kicked in, helped by a capital increase and bond to shore up the company’s balance sheet and 10,000 layoffs. The shares have more than tripled in value in the past year and closed at 3.15 euros on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of 8.77 billion euros. "

2014-03-13,-30,"Intel’s offer to “open source” its methods for verifying that none of its products contain minerals from armed groups involved in the DRC conflict could save other companies significant amounts of money and give them a head start in meeting new U.S. regulations that require them to certify their products are conflict free. “For us, this has always been about doing the right thing,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting in the U.S. Senate offices on Wednesday with DRC officials where he announced the move. Its decision to work on stanching a multimillion dollar mineral trade - used by rebel groups to finance one of the world’s longest running and most brutal conflicts - stands in contrast to how leading representatives of corporate America have responded to the tragedy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers have sued to overturn or limit the conflict minerals rule, adopted by Congress in 2010. They argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals in January that it is impractical, too costly, and would force them to make political statements about the content of their products, in violation of their First Amendment freedom of speech rights. At the heart of their arguments is that business should not be dragged into fundamentally political issues and that they should not be held responsible for righting the wrongs of the world. Strategically their lawsuit is a pushback against the trend for global corporations to take more responsibility for labour conditions, environment, corruption and human rights - issues that traditionally were the realm of the state. Over the past two decades, transnational corporations have grown bigger and more powerful than many states where they operate, and their global supply chains have turned them into empires affecting broad swathes of people. With that power have come new responsibilities. At first corporations embraced voluntary accords to address human rights concerns, starting with audits of fair labour standards after child labour scandals in the garment industry in the 1990s. But the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April 2013, which killed more than 1,000 workers, exposed the limitations of corporate compacts and audits of their supply chain. Voluntary accords have succeeded in setting a commonly agreed set of global standards, said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights division of Human Rights Watch. The technology industry has agreed on privacy standards; security standards have been negotiated. The United Nations has formed the Global Compact for business members who sign up to a common framework for human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 lay out responsibilities. But voluntary accords can only help so much. “The strain today is that we never intended voluntary accords to be the only ones. Our thinking was that they would become law because we rarely see companies or governments adopt human rights out of enlightened self-interest,” Ganesan said. Enter the legislative mandates. Anti-bribery laws have spread in many countries over the past decade. The U.S. and the European Union both require extractives companies to disclose payments to governments in a bid to counter corruption, and there is the U.S. conflicts minerals rule. In the United States, corporate lobbies have challenged both the extractives disclosure and conflict minerals laws in court, arguing they overreach and impose too heavy a burden on business. Certainly they can carry sizable costs. The Securities and Exchange Commission estimates that about 6,000 companies are affected by the conflict minerals rule and it will cost them between $3 billion and $6 billion to check their supply chain, with ongoing annual costs of $207 million to $609 million. This is where Intel comes in. Carolyn Duran, Intel’s director of supply chain, said it took a long time to develop its system for bagging, tagging and verifying minerals as they reach the smelter. Now the costs are manageable and other companies can benefit by learning from its experience. The benefits are tangible, said Faida Mitifu, the DRC ambassador to the United States. At first reduced demand caused hardship in communities dependent on illegal mines, but as violence has ebbed, it has helped foster peace, she said. “It has had a significant impact and created a more responsible chain,” Mitifu said. “The government has worked closely with the mining companies and put in place a system of certification, and we have noticed very positive progress in terms of the industry, and inward investment. More and more, we are exporting clean minerals.” Who would want to oppose that? "
2012-11-13,-7,"* Sharp shares jump up to 11 pct in flat overall market By Nobuhiro Kubo and Mayumi Negishi TOKYO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc are in talks to jointly i nvest about 30 billion yen ($378 million) in debt-stricken Japanese consumer electronics maker Sharp Corp, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Details of the talks were not known, but Sharp, whose displays are used in Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones, is looking to small displays to spark a revival in its fortunes and sees the new generation of high-end laptops as a fresh market. Intel, which has been promoting a new category of thin “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens, has long been interested in Sharp’s power-saving IGZO displays, as it responds to a shift from PCs to smartphones and tablets. Sharp may reach an agreement as early as the end of this month with Qualcomm, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media, adding talks with Intel are less concrete amid the chipmaker’s unclear financial picture. Shares in Sharp jumped 11 percent on the news, but brokers said the rally was likely to be brief as the potential investment would do little to address the firm’s fundamental problems as it struggles with a TV business in retreat, aggressive competition and a $13.8 billion debt load, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Sharp has talked about cutting debt and inventory, but they haven’t made it clear how they plan to generate cash flow and strengthen their capital base,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex Inc.

The Osaka-based firm, which has lost three-quarters of its value so far in 2012, nearly doubled its forecast full-year net loss to 450 billion yen ($5.7 billion) earlier this month after booking a $1.1 billion restructuring charge in July-September. Effectively shunned by the debt capital markets because of its massive losses and falling market share, Sharp received a guarantee for 360 billion yen in loans from its two main lenders, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Corporate Bank, in September. The loans are enough to sustain the company through its next financial year to March 2014, which includes the redemption of 200 billion yen in convertible bonds next September, Sharp Chief Financial Officer Tetsuo Onishi told a briefing. Intel is promoting ultrabooks to counter tablet computers from Apple and earlier this year signed deals with several panel makers to ensure adequate supplies for a wave of ultrabooks with touch screens that use Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8.

2014-05-05,-7,"PHOENIX, May 5 (Reuters) - A chemical leak at Intel Corp’s  manufacturing complex in Arizona has been contained and two workers were taken to hospital for observation, a spokesman for the chipmaker said on Monday. During a tool installation in a basement at the sprawling plant southeast of Phoenix a tube was severed, leading to a spill of around 100 gallons (379 liters) of ammonium hydroxide, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Ten workers near the spill reported to the facility’s medical station and two of those people were sent to hospital for observation, Mulloy said. The spill was in a confined area and no chemicals have been exposed to the public, he said. “The leak has ended. It has been contained. Right now they’re making plans for the cleanup,” Mulloy said. Chandler police spokesman Seth Tyler said fire department crews were called to the scene at about 1:30 p.m. local time after a report that there was “an incident with multiple injuries.” He said a construction crew working inside one of the buildings accidentally cut into a pipe. “During the construction process, a pipe was cut that feeds ammonium into a room in the basement,” he said. “The leak was immediately isolated.” Last June, a gas leak at the plant sickened 43 people, including 11 who were taken to a local hospital.

2012-07-17,6,"Also on Tuesday, storage corporation EMC EMC.N and subsidiary VMWare Inc (VMW.N) announced preliminary quarterly results, and confirmed that EMC’s Pat Gelsinger will take the helm at VMWare. Commentary: “Things seem to be slowing much more. We still think the guidance is a bit too optimistic.” ”As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched. The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance, but they didn‘t. “It’s a solid print and outlook for the third quarter and full year, given the economic backdrop they’re dealing with. The PC client business -- their biggest -- was $60 million below our estimate. That’s infinitesimal. The data center business was a little bit better than expected.” ”This will largely be viewed as in line, with Q2 a little bit better than expected. But there’s a risk that these numbers could still sound challenging to achieve. “The seasonal growth that Intel is expecting is less than normal. That is clearly taking into account global macro conditions. Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent, and Intel’s guidance is comfortably below that.” ”This is good for EMC. It needs the type of leadership that someone like Paul can bring. You have to wonder how much longer Joe Tucci will be CEO, and that Paul may take over if he wants to. VMWare has really kept up with Gartner’s expectations in 2012 in server virtualization. Microsoft will not have a real competitive product out until the end of the year. “Pat Gelsinger is a very capable executive. For folks on the inside, it will be an easy transition because Pat is a lot like Paul with his tech background. He is not afraid to talk tech and he will have instant credibility in Palo Alto.” ”I‘m glad they made the quarter okay, but I don’t like shifting management like this. I‘m just not convinced this is in the best interest of the shareholders. ”Maritz is a known entity, we already have a new CFO, why do we have to have a new CEO at this time? I don’t think investors are happy. “I mean he was running one of the biggest software companies, and now he’s doing this strategy thing at EMC.” "

2012-10-08,-3,"BOSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s McAfee security division is planning to lay off a “small percentage” of its workforce of about 7,100 employees, a company spokesman said on Monday. McAfee spokesman Ian Bain said he could not provide more information about the planned job cuts, which the world’s No. 2 maker of anti-virus software disclosed in response to an inquiry from Reuters. Makers are of security software for personal computers are struggling in the midst of a PC industry slump. They could face increased pressure after Oct. 26, when Microsoft Corp  launches its Windows 8 operating software, which will be bundled with free anti-virus software. Symantec Corp, McAfee’s bigger rival in the anti-virus software market, is in the midst of a strategic review begun in July by the company’s new CEO, Steve Bennett, who took over in July after the board fired his predecessor. Cris Paden, a spokesman for Symantec, said the company had no job cuts to announce. “We evaluate conditions on an ongoing and regular basis and there are no plans as of right now,” Paden said. Intel Corp acquired McAfee, the world’s second-largest security software maker, in February 2011 for $7.7 billion. The division had 7,072 employees as of June 30, according to Bain. Intel is scheduled to release quarterly earnings on Oct. 16, while Symantec plans to release its results on Oct. 24."
2013-01-10,5,"* Internet access crucial for income, equity - report * Boost could yield $50 bln-$70 bln in market opportunities By Susan Heavey WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - More needs to be done to boost women’s and girl’s lagging online access, tech giant Intel Corp said in a report to be released later on Thursday that calls for doubling the number of female Internet users in developing nations over the next three years. The report, funded by the global chipmaker with input from the United Nations and U.S. State Department, among others, points to stubborn gaps in women’s access to the Internet in Africa, the Middle East and other developing parts of the world. It found women are nearly 25 percent less likely than men to be online in those regions, and called on policymakers and technology companies to take steps such as making it easier to access the Internet on mobile phones, allowing free mobile  content and boosting digital literacy to shrink the gap. Surveys and interviews with more than 2,200 women and girls focused on four developing countries - Egypt, India, Mexico and Uganda - found that Internet access was critical for women to earn more money or search and apply for jobs. “With the powerful capabilities the Internet enables - to connect, to learn, to engage, to increase productivity, and to find opportunities - women’s lack of access is giving rise to a second digital divide, one where women and girls risk being left further and further behind,” said Melanne Verveer, ambassador for global women’s issues at the State Department. Although the United States and other developed nations see fairly high levels of overall Internet access and usage among women, some gaps remain, mostly in rural areas or among the poor. In the developing world, however, the gap is far wider. Just 11 percent of men and women in India have Internet access compared to 79 percent in the United States, said Shelly Esque, a vice president for the chipmaker and president of its educational foundation. Thursday’s report shows 600 million women in developing nations, or 21 percent, are online now, and another 450 million are expected to gain Internet access by 2016. But taking extra steps could help bring an additional 150 million women and girls online over the next three years, the report said. “Information was such a powerful tool,” she told Reuters. “What would be the potential for a country like that if they were able to have more equal access? We need to work on that.” A U.N. Human Rights Council resolution last year recognized the power of the Internet to spur progress and encouraged countries to promote and facilitate access to it. Still, many women surveyed by Intel cited barriers ranging from the belief that Internet use was not “appropriate” for them to the cost of getting connected. Illiteracy and lack of awareness about potential uses also were factors. Increased access would not only improve women’s lives but also boost the global economy, according to Intel’s report. It would add between $50 billion and $70 billion in potential new market opportunities, the report said. It could also bring another $13 billion to $18 billion each year globally to the market value of goods and services - a measure known as gross domestic product or GDP. The findings by the Santa Clara, California-based company aim to encourage other technology companies, policymakers and nongovernmental groups to take steps to get more women and girls online, it said. “Without access to the Internet, women lack access to its tools, resources and opportunities,” the report said. “This gap disadvantages not just women, but their families, communities and countries.”"

2014-03-13,-28,"“For us, this has always been about doing the right thing,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting in the U.S. Senate offices on Wednesday with DRC officials where he announced the move. Its decision to work on stanching a multimillion dollar mineral trade - used by rebel groups to finance one of the world’s longest running and most brutal conflicts - stands in contrast to how leading representatives of corporate America have responded to the tragedy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers have sued to overturn or limit the conflict minerals rule, adopted by Congress in 2010. They argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals in January that it is impractical, too costly, and would force them to make political statements about the content of their products, in violation of their First Amendment freedom of speech rights. At the heart of their arguments is that business should not be dragged into fundamentally political issues and that they should not be held responsible for righting the wrongs of the world. Strategically their lawsuit is a pushback against the trend for global corporations to take more responsibility for labor conditions, environment, corruption and human rights - issues that traditionally were the realm of the state. Over the past two decades, transnational corporations have grown bigger and more powerful than many states where they operate, and their global supply chains have turned them into empires affecting broad swathes of people. With that power have come new responsibilities. At first corporations embraced voluntary accords to address human rights concerns, starting with audits of fair labor standards after child labour scandals in the garment industry in the 1990s. But the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April 2013, which killed more than 1,000 workers, exposed the limitations of corporate compacts and audits of their supply chain. Voluntary accords have succeeded in setting a commonly agreed set of global standards, said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights division of Human Rights Watch. The technology industry has agreed on privacy standards; security standards have been negotiated. The United Nations has formed the Global Compact for business members who sign up to a common framework for human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 lay out responsibilities. But voluntary accords can only help so much. “The strain today is that we never intended voluntary accords to be the only ones. Our thinking was that they would become law because we rarely see companies or governments adopt human rights out of enlightened self-interest,” Ganesan said. Enter the legislative mandates. Anti-bribery laws have spread in many countries over the past decade. The U.S. and the European Union both require extractives companies to disclose payments to governments in a bid to counter corruption, and there is the U.S. conflicts minerals rule. In the United States, corporate lobbies have challenged both the extractives disclosure and conflict minerals laws in court, arguing they overreach and impose too heavy a burden on business. Certainly they can carry sizable costs. The Securities and Exchange Commission estimates that about 6,000 companies are affected by the conflict minerals rule and it will cost them between $3 billion and $6 billion to check their supply chain, with ongoing annual costs of $207 million to $609 million. This is where Intel comes in. Carolyn Duran, Intel’s director of supply chain, said it took a long time to develop its system for bagging, tagging and verifying minerals as they reach the smelter. Now the costs are manageable and other companies can benefit by learning from its experience. The benefits are tangible, said Faida Mitifu, the DRC ambassador to the United States. At first reduced demand caused hardship in communities dependent on illegal mines, but as violence has ebbed, it has helped foster peace, she said. “It has had a significant impact and created a more responsible chain,” Mitifu said. “The government has worked closely with the mining companies and put in place a system of certification, and we have noticed very positive progress in terms of the industry, and inward investment. More and more, we are exporting clean minerals.” Who would want to oppose that? "

2014-11-11,3,"Intel this year signed deals with Rockchip and Spreadtrum Communications to use Intel’s technology to make chips for low-cost smartphones and tablets aimed at China’s fast-growing consumer market. Spreadtrum and Rockchip specialize in turnkey smartphone and tablet platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. They typically design their chips with technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc, which competes against Intel’s technology. While the agreements with Intel do not prevent the Chinese chipmakers from continuing to make ARM-based chips, Krzanich told reporters late on Monday he believes that within two or three years they will exclusively use Intel’s architecture. With leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc offering high-end chips based on ARM and Taiwan’s MediaTek  attacking the Chinese market with inexpensive chips also designed using ARM, adopting Intel’s architecture and cutting-edge factories offer a way to differentiate with better performance and features, Krzanich said. “If you’re a small guy trying to compete, it’s tough to be in that battle.” Intel was late to mobile and has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones.

2014-09-09,-1,"After falling behind rival chipmakers in mobile in recent years, Krzanich set a goal for Intel’s chips to be used in 40 million tablets in 2014, up from 10 million the previous year. To reach it, Intel is paying manufacturers some of the initial engineering cost of developing tablets using its chips, hoping those companies will continue to use them for future devices. The vast majority of tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc. “We’ve made good progress getting into tablets,” Krzanich told reporters ahead of the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. “We’ve gone from nothing to something where I consider us a real tablet manufacturer.” Investors have pushed shares of Intel to decade highs, partly on bets that the global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s introduction of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom. Shares of Intel have surged about 35 percent so far this year, far more than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 8 percent. Intel would not say how much it was spending to coax tablet makers into using its chips. But reflecting an ongoing struggle to break into smartphones and tablets, the company’s mobile and communications group’s second-quarter revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million, and the unit had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Krzanich said he hoped to avoid using costly subsidies when he sets a new goal for smartphone chip shipments for 2015. Intel’s upcoming Sofia smartphone chip includes a 3G version for low-cost devices in developing countries like China as well as a version with 4G for the United States. “It’s a product built for the right price point,” Krzanich said.

The European Union competition authority said at the time that Intel sought to thwart Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The Commission said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. The Luxembourg-based General Court will rule on the case on June 12, a court official said.

The chipmaker in December announced it was developing smart glasses with Luxottica, which owns the Oakley brand. Krzanich demonstrated autonomous flying drones able to navigate around obstacles. He also showed a smaller drone worn on the wrist until it is launched into the air. Called Nixie, the camera-equipped gadget in November won a wearable computing contest sponsored by Intel. Intel was slow to launch chips for smartphones and tablets, and Krzanich, who took over as CEO in 2013, has made it a top priority to avoid repeating that mistake with future computing trends. Krzanich announced a goal to reach full representation of women and minorities in Intel’s workforce by 2020. Like most Silicon Valley companies, Intel has a poor track record employing women and some minorities. Just a quarter of Intel’s U.S. employees in 2013 were women and 12 percent of its workforce were Hispanic or African American, according to company data. Last year, the chipmaker found itself in the midst of  a controversy over gender equality in the video game industry after it pulled advertising from a gaming website in response to an email campaign. In a movement that has come to be known as “Gamergate,” self-described videogame fans lashed back aggressively online at criticism about sexism in gaming culture.

2013-09-10,5,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Intel is working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, a bid by the company to make sure it will be at the crest of the next big technology wave after arriving late to the smartphone and tablet revolution. The new line of chips, called Intel Quark, will ship next year and include an ingestible version aimed at biomedical uses, Intel’s president, Renee James, told reporters late on Monday. The Quark chips will be five times smaller and 10 times more power efficient than Intel’s Atom chips for tablets and smartphones, she said. “We’re very committed to not missing the next big thing,” James said. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich and James spoke on Tuesday at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, their first major public appearance since their promotion in May, when Paul Otellini stepped aside as chief executive. Krzanich said tablets made with Intel chips and priced at less than $100 would be on store shelves in time for this year’s holiday season. He was flanked by rows of Android and Windows 8 tablets, many of them with attachable keyboards - an effort by Intel to show conference attendees it has made progress in mobile. Intel said the first chips made on its cutting-edge 14 nanometer technology would start production late this year and be available in 2014, helping it extend its competitive lead in manufacturing. Intel’s most advanced chips are currently made with 22 nanometer production technology, which is already more advanced than production lines at Intel rivals like Samsung and TSMC. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry, but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Technology companies see wearables as a growth opportunity amid signs that explosive expansion in smartphones shipments since Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007 is receding. Last week, Samsung Electronics launched the Galaxy Gear watch, and Qualcomm, an Intel rival, launched the Toq smartwatch in a bid to showcase its technology to potential manufacturers. Krzanich showed off a prototype watch and clunky bracelet made with the Quark chips. ”The idea is not to bring these to market but to come up with devices that our partners can use to develop their own products in this open ecosystem, he said. A three-decade Intel veteran seen as the company’s manufacturing guru, Krzanich has said that under his leadership Intel will give much more priority to its Atom line of mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. Processors based on technology from ARM and made by Qualcomm and Samsung account for most of the mobile market. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. The company has promised major performance improvements in its new Bay Trail chip for tablets. The Bay Trail chip is based on Intel’s new Silvermont architecture, which is the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption. Also on Tuesday, Intel launched a new line of its brawny Xeon chips for servers, a market it almost completely dominates. The new server chips have up to 50 percent better performance than previous versions and 45 percent more energy efficiency, Intel said. Intel recently began shipping a low-power line of data center chips based on the Silvermont architecture, part of its strategy to defend its territory from smaller chipmakers hoping to use ARM technology widely used in smartphones to push into the servers."
2014-09-09,-1,"To reach it, Intel is paying manufacturers some of the initial engineering cost of developing tablets using its chips, hoping those companies will continue to use them for future devices. The vast majority of tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L. “We’ve made good progress getting into tablets,” Krzanich told reporters ahead of the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. “We’ve gone from nothing to something where I consider us a real tablet manufacturer.” Investors have pushed shares of Intel to decade highs, partly on bets that the global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) introduction of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom. Shares of Intel have surged about 35 percent so far this year, far more than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 8 percent.  Intel would not say how much it was spending to coax tablet makers into using its chips. But reflecting an ongoing struggle to break into smartphones and tablets, the company’s mobile and communications group’s second-quarter revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million, and the unit had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Krzanich said he hoped to avoid using costly subsidies when he sets a new goal for smartphone chip shipments for 2015. Intel’s upcoming Sofia smartphone chip includes a 3G version for low-cost devices in developing countries like China as well as a version with 4G for the United States. “It’s a product built for the right price point,” Krzanich said. At Tuesday’s event, Intel was expected to highlight its determination to become a player in a growing wave of wearable computing gadgets like smart watches and fitness trackers. Intel has been working with design company Opening Ceremony to launch a fashion bracelet with semiprecious gems, communications features and wireless charging.  In March, Intel bought fitness bracelet maker Basis Science. Last week it announced plans to work with fashion accessory retailer Fossil Group (FOSL.O) to develop more wearable computing devices. "

Oil prices were up more than 2 percent, with U.S. crude touching a 15-month high after the government reported a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector jumped 2 percent, the most in three weeks, with a 5.2 percent rise in Halliburton also providing a boost after the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results.

The financial sector  has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.8 percent advance. “We’ve seen earnings kind of trough, we are going to see better earnings and we are going to start to move from the negative overall into the positive this quarter and next,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Phoenix, Arizona. A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 6.1 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings’ expectations.

2016-03-21,0,"Grove was Intel’s first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practical-minded member of a triumvirate that eventually led “Intel Inside” processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers. With his motto “only the paranoid survive,” which became the title of his best-selling management book, Grove championed an innovative environment within Intel that became a blueprint for successful California startups. Grove, who was named man of the year by Time magazine in 1997, encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers - or opportunities - for Intel. In doing so, he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay. Grove’s overhaul of Intel’s business - switching from digital memory to processors - was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them. ”It’s not that you shouldn’t plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen,” Grove said. While Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry, Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products. He was responsible for driving growth in Intel’s profits and stock price through the 1980s and 1990s.     Grove went to work in 1963 at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips. At Fairchild, he also met chip visionaries Noyce and Moore, who left to found Intel in 1968. Grove quickly joined them, running research and manufacturing. He became Intel’s president in 1979, CEO in 1987 and chairman and CEO in 1997. He gave up his CEO title in 1998 and stayed on as chairman until 2004.  In its early years, Intel focused on making DRAM memory chips. When Japanese competition soared, Grove made the fateful decision to reinvent Intel as a manufacturer of microprocessors – the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices. As the personal computer industry took off in the 1980s, Intel supplied its processors to IBM and then to Compaq and other manufacturers making “IBM clone” PCs.  Intel’s chips, along with Microsoft’s Windows operating system, quickly became an industry standard in the exploding PC industry, with Grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors. Under his stewardship, the Pentium brand and “Intel Inside” logo became widely recognized by consumers. Intel remains one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies but the PC chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets. Grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the United States, arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products - like batteries or televisions - meant U.S. companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs. Intel still makes most of its chips in U.S. plants. During his time at Intel in the 1990s Grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in Fortune magazine, criticizing the medical establishment’s treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research. In later life, Grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on Parkinson’s disease, a condition he suffered from. He also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry. Grove and his wife, Eva, who married a year after meeting while working at a resort in New Hampshire in 1957, had two daughters. "
2016-10-14,1,"The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centers to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said. Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies Ltd, Micron Technology Inc, NVIDIA Corp and Xilinx Inc are also members of the OpenCAPI consortium. "
2013-05-30,-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics  has chosen an Intel Corp processor to power a new version of one of its top-tier Android tablets, a source with knowledge of the plans told Reuters, in a major victory for the U.S. chipmaker, which is  struggling to find its footing in the mobile market. Samsung has chosen Intel’s Clover Trail+ mobile chip for at least one version of its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, which competes with Apple Inc’s iPad, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the specifications have not been announced. Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings  for its best-selling mobile devices. It employs Intel processors for its line of Microsoft Windows “ATIV” tablets -- a much smaller market compared with devices based on Google Inc’s  Android. Samsung will unveil new ATIV tablets using Intel chips at a June 20 event in London, said the source, as well as an additional person familiar with the event. It was unclear whether the Galaxy Tab would debut at the same event. The Asian electronics giant’s decision to begin using Intel  in a marquee Android device counts as a coup for the US chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in. It was unclear whether the Samsung, the world’s largest manufacturer of tablets after Apple, plans other versions of the 10-inch Galaxy Tab carrying its own, or other companies’, processors. A spokeswoman for South Korea-based Samsung declined to comment. An Intel spokesman also declined to comment. The use of an Intel Clover Trail+ chip in the upcoming tablet was first reported on by VentureBeat and other blogs last week. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but was slow to make chips that appealed to makers of smartphones and tablets as the market boomed following Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and iPad in 2010. Applications processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung and Nvidia  now dominate a market that research firm Strategy Analytics estimated could hit $25 billion by 2016 versus $9 billion in 2011. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who took the helm this month, has stated that one of his top goals is to expand the Silicon Valley chipmaker’s footprint in mobile devices. Intel is rushing to adapt its powerful PC chips to use less energy and work more efficiently in mobile devices. It has so far scored a few minor “design wins”, getting its processors into a few mobile devices. For instance, an Intel mobile processor was used in a version of Motorola’s Razr smartphone launched last year in markets like Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany and Mexico. Intel has yet to launch chips capable of supporting high-speed Long Term Evolution technology, a major barrier to competing in mobile devices aimed at the United States, where the standard is becoming increasingly common. Samsung has nearly 18 percent of the market for tablets, according to IDC."
2015-07-14,-6,"Intel’s stock is down 18 percent year to date and has fallen about 7 percent since June 25, when Micron Technology (MU.O) blamed weakness in PCs for a drop in quarterly revenues. “The narrative is that it doesn’t get much worse than it is right now,” said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, who rates Intel  “outperform.”  “As long as DCG (the data center group) hangs in there, I think the stock will probably go up from here,” he said. Suggesting that some short sellers believe Intel’s stock is unlikely to fall much further, the number of shares borrowed has fallen 21 percent since June 29, according to SunGard’s Astec Analytics.  But the number of Intel shares shorted at the end of June was the highest since mid-March according to exchange data.   “Our number still suggests many short sellers are holding onto their positions,” wrote SunGard analyst Karl Loomes in an email. Shares out on loan are typically used for short sales. Options market traders appear to be slightly cautious ahead of Intel’s report. Open interest in Intel puts has been growing at a faster pace than calls since June. Currently 1.2 puts are open for each call, the highest this reading has been this year according to Trade Alert. Intel’s stock was flat on Tuesday and trades at 13 times expected earnings. Also hurting Intel’s stock recently, rival processor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) last week posted a steeper-than-expected dip in fiscal first-quarter due to weakness in PCs. Seagate Technology (STX.O), which makes hard-drives for PCs, on Monday warned of poor results for its June quarter. Intel’s data center group, which includes high-end server chips, has helped offset trouble in the PC industry in recent years, but it might also be at risk. Last Thursday, QLogic Corp’s QLGC.O stock slid 21 percent after the network infrastructure maker warned that its revenue in the June quarter would be less than expected due to general weakness in server and storage markets. "
2013-07-17,-6,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 (Reuters) - Intel Corp cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it is scaling back capital spending as it adjusts to a painful contraction of personal computer sales and economic weakness in China, one of its biggest markets. The forecast and cut in capital spending were announced on Wednesday in the company’s quarterly earnings report, the first under new Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. The soft-spoken manufacturing guru, who took over as CEO in May and faces falling PC sales and a hyper-competitive mobile market, was quick to acknowledge Intel’s past errors. He said the top chipmaker would aggressively speed up the rollout of new Atom mobile chips. “Intel was slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trends,” Krzanich said. “We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology.” Within days of taking over in May, Krzanich launched a sweeping company reorganization. He has also been spending a lot of time with manufacturing customers, meetings that will quickly lead to more mobile business for Intel, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to make its chips suitable for smartphones and tablets. Smith said that in the fast-expanding mobile market, where Qualcomm is the leading chip supplier, customers want more options. “They want alternatives in a market kind of becoming dominated by one player and they see us as being a very capable supplier,” Smith said. “They wanted to look Brian in the eye, and now he’s looking back and saying ‘We’re going to double our efforts here.'” Smith, said in an earlier interview on CNBC that the chipmaker had seen softer sales in China than it had anticipated. Faced with slow demand, Intel said it was cutting 2013 capital spending to $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The cut follows a similar reduction from $13 billion to $12 billion in April. Intel said it expects 2013 revenue to be flat from the year before. Last quarter Intel forecast a low single digit percentage increase in 2013. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon compared Intel’s reduction of expectations on Wednesday to a similar “reset” in 2012. “Last year, they had a come-to-Jesus moment two-thirds of the way through Q3. This time at least they seem to be reacting a bit sooner, but you have to ask if it’s enough,” Rasgon said. Global shipments of personal computers dropped 11 percent in the second quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline in a market that has been devastated by the popularity of tablets. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is eager to build on. Samsung Electronics has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time. And in May, the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption that some experts believe might help it compete better against Qualcomm. Shares of Intel have risen about 16 percent this year and trade at the equivalent of 12 times expected earnings, a valuation similar to that of Qualcomm’s stock. Krzanich left open the possibility of opening Intel’s factories to more customers making chips designed with architectures that differ from Intel’s own, a side business that so far has remained very small. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s iPhone chips. “We are taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders,” he said. Intel posted second-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion and said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.896 billion in revenue for the second quarter and $13.732 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the second quarter, Intel reported net earnings of $2.0 billion, or 39 cents a share, in line with expectations. That compared with $2.827 billion, or 54 cents, in the same quarter last year. Shares of Intel fell about 4 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.41 percent at $24.15 on the Nasdaq."

2014-10-14,1,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Intel Corp gave a current-quarter revenue forecast above expectations and said the supply chain was in good shape ahead of holiday season as demand for personal computers recovered. A global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s launch of the iPad four years ago has stabilized in recent months, in part due to companies replacing employees’ older laptops. Intel said in a statement on Tuesday that demand for its chips was in good shape. “The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycles,” Intel said. The recovering PC industry has helped push Intel’s shares 24 percent higher in 2014, making it the top performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. “The telling thing will be next year. Do we continue to get a healthier, more stable PC market?,” said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. “I think the enterprise refresh largely plays out by the end of 2014 and then next year the PC industry returns to modest annual declines.” Tuesday’s results, the first from a major technology company this earnings season, came after Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip warned last Thursday of weak demand in China that would soon become visible across the chip industry, sparking a broad selloff in chip stocks. Intel said its gross margins would likely slip to 64 percent in the current quarter from 65 percent in the third quarter. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and has been spending heavily to catch up to Qualcomm. For the third quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion on revenue of $1 million, reflecting subsidies Intel has been paying to persuade tablet makers to use its chips. Intel posted third-quarter net income of $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as demand for personal computers stabilized. Analysts on average expected EPS of 65 cents. Third-quarter revenue was $14.6 billion, up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average expected third-quarter revenue of $14.44 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $14.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2014-04-15,1,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 15 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  first-quarter net profit exceeded Wall Street’s estimates as the chipmaker wrestles with slow demand for personal computers and its chief executive officer said an ambitious goal to stake out market share in tablets was on track. With personal computer shipments falling for eight straight quarters through March, some analysts believe the industry’s decline is close to hitting bottom, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile and wearable devices. Following its first-quarter report on Tuesday, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the chipmaker continues to expects PC shipments to decline slightly in 2014. “But there are pretty clear signs of stabilization,” Smith told Reuters. “You have an ageing install base of PCs and we’re bringing exciting products to the market place and that’s leading to the pockets of strength we’re seeing in the PC market.” In its report, Intel said revenue from its PC client group in the first quarter was $7.9 billion, down 1 percent from the year before. The company also expects a full-year gross margin of 61 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. That is 1 percentage point higher than Intel’s previous forecast. Intel shares rose 1.6 percent in extended trading after closing up 0.80 percent at $26.77 on Nasdaq. “The margin guidance is what’s pushing the stock up. The PC client group was roughly in line with seasonal,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Tuesday’s results included a new financial reporting structure to better reflect its focus on two small key areas: mobile and the growing field of linking up electronic devices, known as Internet of Things. Intel said its mobile and communications group had revenue of $156 million in the first quarter, down 61 percent from the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that Intel shipped 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter and is on track to reach a goal of shipping 40 million tablet chips in 2014. Last year, Intel shipped 10 million tablet chips and to reach its target for 2014, the company is offering to heavily subsidize manufacturers’ costs to include its components in their future tablets. Asked whether Intel expected that some of those mobile chips might be used in low-end laptops instead of tablets, CFO Smith said: “We mean 40 million tablets with Intel chips in them by the end of this year, with the majority of those being Android-based tablets.” After underestimating the impact of smartphones and tablets, Intel is keen to make sure it is part of an emerging trend toward wearable computing devices such as smart watches. In March, it bought Basis Science, the maker of a wearable health tracker, as part of that push. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a major splash with consumers any time soon. Analysts are skeptical that chips for wearables will be able to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost because of the shrinking PC industry. Intel’s data center group, a big contributor to the company’s overall profits, had revenue of $3.1 billion in the first quarter, up 11 percent year over year. The chipmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $1.947 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $2.045 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average expected 37 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue was $12.76 billion, compared with $12.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Analysts had expected $12.814 billion. Intel forecast revenue of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the second quarter, which ends in June. Analysts had expected $12.957 billion on average.   (Reporting by Noel Randewich.

2013-05-21,-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s new chief executive, Brian Krzanich, has launched a sweeping company reorganization and created a unit aimed at growing its market share in mobile technology. The shakeup, announced internally just days after the 30-year veteran took the helm, places most of the main product groups of the world’s top chipmaker directly under the CEO’s supervision and hands its sprawling global manufacturing operation to new president Renee James, said a source close to the company, who declined to be identified. Details of the reorganization were outlined in an internal memo sent to employees on Monday. It was described to Reuters by a company source and details of the reorganization, which is effective immediately, were confirmed by spokesman Chuck Mulloy on Tuesday. “As your CEO I am committed to making quick, informed decisions. I am committed to being bolder, moving faster, and accepting that this means changes will be made knowing that we will listen, learn and then make adjustments in order to keep pace with a rapidly changing industry,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. “Our business faces significant challenges, and we simply must continue to execute while finalizing our future strategy,” he reportedly wrote. Krzanich officially took over as CEO last week and said that under his leadership, the top chipmaker will be more responsive to customers in an intensified focus on the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market where it lags rivals. The chipmaker’s main product groups - including the PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Intel Architecture group chief Dadi Perlmutter - now report directly to Krzanich. After Perlmutter transfers his business groups, he and Krzanich will “define his next significant contribution at Intel,” according to the email described by the source. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets. The latter two markets are now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. In his three-decade career at Intel, Krzanich has become known for making fast decisions after consulting with trusted lieutenants. This week’s reorganization is Krzanich’s first step in a process aimed at making Intel more focused and more agile, Mulloy said. “The new devices organization is responsible for rapidly turning brilliant technical and business model innovations into products that shape and lead markets,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. James, formerly head of the software arm, will now also oversee the company’s sprawling global manufacturing operations and all aspects of security technology. Mulloy said Intel presidents have traditionally been responsible for managing the manufacturing operations. James will also lead corporate strategy and planning. Her  previous job as Intel’s software chief has been taken over by Doug Fisher, a senior executive from that group. Hermann Eul previously shared responsibility for Intel’s mobile communications group, which makes smartphone chips, with Bell, and he will now take full responsibility for that business. Senior Intel executives in the past have privately warned against focusing too much on catching up in smartphones and tablets at the expense of missing out on future trends in mobile. Krzanich’s creation of the “new devices” group signals he is also looking beyond today’s gadgets. “It’s a matter of what they do with the new division, what can they identify and then deliver that maybe would not have otherwise been something we’d see Intel inside of. It could be very meaningful if they can execute,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Venture capital fund Intel Capital, led by Arvind Sodhani, now reports to Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith instead of to the CEO. Intel’s IT department, which reported to Krzanich before his appointment as CEO, will also now report to Smith. Shares of Intel were up 0.2 percent at $24.13 on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq."
2016-10-14,1,"The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centers to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said. Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies Ltd, Micron Technology Inc, NVIDIA Corp and Xilinx Inc are also members of the OpenCAPI consortium. "
2014-06-12,-22,"* Intel declines to say if it will go to Europe’s top court   (Recasts; adds Intel, lawyer, BEUC comments) By Foo Yun Chee LUXEMBOURG, June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Intel  lost on Thursday its challenge against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.44 billion) European Union fine handed down five years ago, as Europe’s second highest court said regulators did not act too harshly. The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. Judges at the Luxembourg-based General Court said on Thursday they backed the Commission’s decision. “The Commission demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that Intel attempted to conceal the anti-competitive nature of its practices and implemented a long term comprehensive strategy to foreclose AMD from the strategically most important sales channels,” the court said in a near 300-page decision. Judges said the EU watchdog had not been heavy-handed with the level of the fine, equal to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover, versus a possible maximum of 10 percent. While Commission penalties rarely hit the top figure, the rising level of fines is a source of worry for many companies. “The General Court considers that none of the arguments raised by Intel supports the conclusion that the fine imposed is disproportionate. On the contrary, it must be considered that that fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case,” judges said. Intel, which can take its case further to the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law, declined to say whether it would do so. “We are very disappointed about the decision. It’s a complex case which is reflected in the decision. We will begin evaluating the decision,” Intel spokeswoman Sophie Jacobs said. “When large companies abuse their dominance of the market, it causes direct harm to consumers. The court’s ruling issued a strong reminder that such behaviour is illegal and unacceptable,” said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens. The court’s judgement suggests companies would be better off settling antitrust charges instead of fighting them, said Martina Maier, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery. “Companies under investigation by the Commission should not count on winning in court with the argument that the Commission would not have properly assessed the economic effects of an abuse of dominance,” she said. “This might well lead to a supplementary incentive for a company under investigation for an alleged abuse of dominance to settle with the Commission or to offer commitments in order to motivate the Commission to end its investigation.” Samsung recently settled EU charges while Google  has also clinched a deal with the Commission. The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission. "
2015-04-14,0,"April 14 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp forecast revenue broadly in line with Wall Street’s expectations and signaled a hefty cut in capital expenditures this year, lifting its shares in after-hours trading. The company, world’s largest semiconductor maker, hit the drastically lower revenue forecast it offered for itself last month, and investors breathed a sigh of relief that the company, which is struggling with shrinking demand for PCs, did not have any more bad news. “It’s slightly better than feared,” said Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital markets. “It looks like bottom line impacts are mitigated by better expenses, interest income and taxes.” Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $500 million, based on expectations of stronger demand for its personal computer chips and continued strength in its data center business. Analysts were expecting $13.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Intel forecast flat revenue, also in line with Wall Street’s estimates. “I think the full-year guidance being flat year over year (is) supportive of a stable PC environment, despite the first-quarter weakness,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji Desilva said. Intel said it would cut 2015 capital expenditures to $8.7 billion from $10 billion, a reduction that analysts said should improve free cash flow. Intel’s shares rose 2 percent to $32.05 in after-market trading. Intel reported revenue of $12.8 billion for the first quarter, ended March 28, flat with a year ago and slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $12.9 billion. The chipmaker had slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast by nearly $1 billion to $12.8 billion in March, citing weak demand for PCs that use the company’s chips. The company posted net income of $1.99 billion, or 41 cents per share, up from $1.93 billion, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 41 cents. The company, which reported consolidated results for its PC and money-losing mobile businesses for the first time, had posted better-than-expected profits in the last four quarters. Analysts have criticized the consolidation, saying it limits transparency, especially into the mobile business. Intel has been lagging behind rivals such as Qualcomm Inc  and ARM Holdings Plc - the British company behind the processor in Apple’s iPhone 6 - in the fast-growing smartphone market.

2015-06-01,0,"* Altera shares trading well below offer * Deal is third big one in chip industry this year   (Adds link to Breakingviews column; updates shares) By Lehar Maan and Liana B. Baker June 1 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to buy Altera Corp for $16.7 billion as the world’s biggest chipmaker seeks to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry by expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers. By combining with Altera, Intel will be able to bundle its processing chips with the smaller company’s programmable chips, which are used, among other things, to speed up Web-searches. Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera’s close on Friday. Altera’s shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading. That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies. Intel’s shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86. The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It seems very high to me,” Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. “The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn’t turn out very well for Broadcom.” The deal price is unchanged from Intel’s unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April. The integration of Altera’s chips with Intel’s will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “That’s the piece that’s pretty exciting about it,” he said. Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said. The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry’s biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion. Altera’s programmable chips will allow Intel to increase the computational capability of its Xeon server chips, which could be under attack post the Avago-Broadcom merger, Summit Research analyst Srinivasan Sundararajan told Reuters. NXP Semiconductors NV set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  for $12 billion. It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company’s mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers. Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner. Net revenue from Intel’s PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue. The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks. Up to Friday’s close, Altera’s shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel’s shares rose 14.6 percent. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Rothschild Inc are financial advisers to Intel. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP are legal advisers.

2013-02-12,-3,"DANA POINT, Calif., Feb 12 (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp plans to launch an Internet television service this year with live and on-demand content, entering a hotly competitive race as its core PC business erodes. Shifting into an unfamiliar and potentially costly market in which Intel lacks experience and relationships, Erik Huggers, vice president and general manager of Intel Media, said he is negotiating with content providers. He said hundreds of Intel employees and their families are already testing a set-top box the company will sell as part of the service. Intel’s move puts it into competition with heavyweights like Apple, Amazon and Google that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The chipmaker plans to offer consumers smaller bundles of content than those currently offered by cable operators, Erik Huggers, vice president and general manager of Intel Media, told the AllThingsDigital “Dive into Media” conference on Tuesday. Asked if Intel has inked any content deals, Huggers said he  is working with providers and is confident Intel will have a compelling product to launch this year. “We have been working for (the past) year to set up Intel media, a new group focused on developing an Internet platform,” Huggers said. “It’s not a value play, it’s a quality play where we’ll create a superior experience for the end user.” Intel has struggled to get its virtual television service off the ground due to unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let the company unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay, according to sources. Silicon Valley has been taking aim at the U.S. cable television market - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. Technology companies see opportunities due to reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to mounting programming costs. “There is an opportunity to offer a bundle that can be curated by the consumer, an opportunity to create smarter bundles,” Huggers said. Intel’s set-top-box will also have a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. “There’s a scenario where the TV recognizes that it’s you and says ‘Hey, I know what you like. I know what you want to watch’, versus the environment we’re in today where the TV literally is not interested in you at all,” Huggers told Reuters In an interview. Some media executives are skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make its service viable. That view was shared by Bernard Gershon, head of digital consultancy GershonMedia and a former Disney senior vice president for strategic planning who helped develop Disney’s online strategy. “The chance that Intel launches is zero,” Gershon, who speaks with media and digital executives, told Reuters at the conference. “They haven’t cut any deals with any content companies, and they are not offering something that differentiates itself enough on service or price to get the deals done.” Analysts see Intel’s leap into Internet television, along with its growing focus on smartphones and tablets, as a way to diversify beyond the slowing PC market. “The question you have to ask with Intel is, Is anything they do big enough to move the needle?” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “You’re not going to make or break the company on something like this.” Huggers said in the interview that Intel employees are testing the device’s user interface, sound and picture quality and other features. “We’re actively testing it in the field with employees. It’s not the final product, but it’s certainly functional,” he said. Industry insiders have said Apple may unveil a TV-based device that has the potential to shake up the cozy television content and distribution industry the way the iPod and iPhone disrupted music and mobile content. Sources say Apple, which already sells a $99 set top box called Apple TV that streams Netflix and other content, has opened discussions with providers but it is unclear how much headway it has made, despite its reputation as a tough negotiator. Huggers previously worked at Microsoft and the BBC, where in 2007 he launched iPlayer, an online service letting viewers catch up with programs they missed on regular television. “The model we envision is a model where live television and catch-up television live in the same paradigm,” Huggers said. Intel’s shares closed up 0.76 percent, at $21.19."
2014-09-26,9,"By Gerry Shih and Noel Randewich BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  said it will pay as much as $1.5 billion for a 20 percent stake in two mobile chipmakers with ties to the Chinese government, in the hopes of catching up in a smartphone chip industry dominated by rival Qualcomm Inc. Intel will acquire the stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through a deal with Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm which owns the two mobile chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor company, more known for chips used in personal computers, has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market. The landmark deal would give Intel a greater foothold in the Chinese mobile chip market, which has become a nexus of the global smartphone industry. Conversely, the deal would provide two Chinese chipmakers support from a U.S. semiconductor giant on chip design and development, an area deemed to be of vital strategic importance by the government in Beijing. “It has become a national priority of China to grow its semiconductor industry,” said Tsinghua Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo in a statement released by Intel on Friday. “The strategic collaboration between Tsinghua Unigroup and Intel ranges from design and development to marketing and equity investments, which demonstrate Intel’s confidence in the Chinese market and strong commitment to Chinese semiconductor industry.” Speculation of the deal has been rife in the Chinese press for several weeks. The announcement confirmed a report by Reuters earlier Friday. Intel’s stake will be via a newly created holding company that owns the units Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics, Unigroup said, adding that the deal is still waiting for government approval. Unigroup is controlled by the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. The institution counts China’s President Xi Jinping as one of its alumni. The government in Beijing has said in published policy papers that it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically. INTEL‘S NEW CEO Since Brian Krzanich took the helm last year, Intel has pursued an array of deals and strategies to ensure its chip technology gets into more smartphones and tablets. The newest investment comes less than six months after Intel reached an agreement with Chinese chip maker Rockchip to make inexpensive tablet chips with Intel’s architecture and branding. The CEO has also opened the chipmaker’s prized, cutting-edge factories to paying customers. More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing. “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, before the announcement. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.” While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilisation of demand for personal computers. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus to China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Spreadtrum is one of several chipmakers that specialise in turnkey smartphone platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use.     (Editing by Peter Henderson, Steve Orlofsky and Ryan Woo)"

2014-01-07,-12,"BOSTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - John McAfee, the flamboyant millionaire who founded a pioneering anti-virus software company that Intel Corp bought for $7.7 billion, says he is glad that the chipmaker plans to drop his name from its products. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich announced the decision to abandon the McAfee name late on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, saying the company plans to adopt the “Intel Security” brand. “I’ve been begging them to drop the brand or fix the product,” McAfee said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. He did not speculate on a reason for the move, which was not completely unexpected. Last June, McAfee appeared in a profanity-laced video attacking the quality of the software produced by the company, which he founded in the late 1980s. He said he frequently gets emails from customers who complain that it degrades the performance of their computers and is difficult to remove. Intel has repeatedly said the attacks on the quality of its software are “ludicrous” and without merit. Its chief technology officer, Michael Fey, said on Tuesday that the company was not concerned about the video, partly because customers knew that John McAfee had not worked for the company in some 20 years. “Everybody realized the man was trying to get a laugh or make a joke. It is far from something that most buyers took seriously,” he said. “We didn’t really feel much pressure.” Still, he said, it would be a relief to be able to ignore John McAfee’s antics once Intel stopped using his name. “As an employee I am happy to stop having to answer that,” Fey said. Questions about Intel’s plans for keeping the McAfee brand first surfaced in late 2012, when John McAfee, to much publicity, left the Central American nation of Belize after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. He said he was framed for a murder he did not commit. John McAfee fled to the United States in December 2012 and is developing technology dubbed D-Central that he says will help keep Internet communications safe from government snooping. Then in his video attacking the software, the millionaire fires a gun into a computer. He was undressed and pawed by a group of young women. McAfee said he did it all to mock the media’s unfair portrayal of him as unhinged. “I am who I am. I‘m sorry I live on the edge and enjoy life and don’t care what people think of me,” he said on Tuesday, when asked how he felt about Intel dumping his name. “I‘m sorry that the software has my name.”"
2015-04-09,-4,"By Greg Roumeliotis April 9 (Reuters) - Discussions on a takeover by Intel Corp  of smaller chip maker Altera Corp have ended as the companies were unable to agree on price, a person familiar with the matter said, but Altera shares rose, suggesting it is still a potential target. Altera’s shares closed up 3.2 percent at $43.33 on the Nasdaq after earlier falling as much as 8 percent. Intel shares closed down slightly at $31.24 after dropping earlier in the day. Intel's offer was in the neighborhood of the low-$50 per share range, CNBC reported earlier on Thursday. (cnb.cx/1Do4pl4)  That represented a 50 percent premium to Altera's price before news of the talks was first reported on March 27. Intel declined comment. Altera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Altera’s apparent refusal to do a deal puts pressure on its board, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “Investors are going to demand some explanations,” he said. “If the board and management can’t show a plan that would create a value at or above what Intel is offering, they are going to have to justify why they are saying no.” Late last month, Intel was reported to be in talks to buy Altera in a deal that could have topped $10 billion. Altera had a market capitalization of $12.6 billion as of Wednesday. Its shares had surged more than 20 percent since merger talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Had the deal gone through, the takeover would have been Intel’s largest acquisition, topping its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. Altera would appeal to Intel for its line of programmable chips, increasingly used in data centers and customized for functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks. Deals in the chip sector have been expected after NXP Semiconductors’ $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor was announced last month. Worldwide semiconductor mergers and acquisitions were worth $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, Thomson Reuters data shows. In the 12 months through March 2, four hundred seventy-two chip M&A deals were made worldwide, up from 383 in the previous year. Market analysts said they expect the chip M&A boom to continue despite the end of the Altera-Intel talks. “Perhaps it impacts those two stocks but I don’t see it offsetting the major trend, which is certainly for more deals,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC.

2015-10-13,-5,"* Cuts 2015 capex for third time * Sees Q4 revenue of $14.8 bln, plus or minus $500 mln   (Adds details, analyst comment) By Anya George Tharakan and Arathy S Nair Oct 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp cut revenue growth forecast for its highly profitable business of making chips for data centers as businesses reduce spending due to weak macroeconomic growth. The world’s biggest chipmaker’s shares reversed course to trade down as much as 3.8 percent after the bell on Tuesday following the forecast. Intel has been counting on the data center business to help offset declining demand for its chips used in personal computers, its biggest revenue generator. The company agreed in June to acquire Altera Corp  for $16.7 billion to expand its line-up of the higher-margin chips used in data centers. Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center business to grow in “low double digits” in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent growth. The business, the company’s second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter. The company was not “rethinking the long-term growth” of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call. “It’s a combination of two things - data center weakness and units - it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,” analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said. The weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company’s better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter. The company also trimmed its 2015 capital expenditure for the third time to $7.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel said revenue from its PC business fell 7.5 percent to $8.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner. Intel's net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/1k2L5TW) Analysts on average had expected a profit of 59 cents per share. Net revenue declined to $14.47 billion from $14.55 billion, but beat analysts’ estimate of $14.22 billion.

2013-05-30,-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics  has chosen an Intel Corp processor to power a new version of one of its top-tier Android tablets, a source with knowledge of the plans told Reuters, in a major victory for the U.S. chipmaker, which is  struggling to find its footing in the mobile market. Samsung has chosen Intel’s Clover Trail+ mobile chip for at least one version of its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, which competes with Apple Inc’s iPad, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the specifications have not been announced. Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings  for its best-selling mobile devices. It employs Intel processors for its line of Microsoft Windows “ATIV” tablets -- a much smaller market compared with devices based on Google Inc’s  Android. Samsung will unveil new ATIV tablets using Intel chips at a June 20 event in London, said the source, as well as an additional person familiar with the event. It was unclear whether the Galaxy Tab would debut at the same event. The Asian electronics giant’s decision to begin using Intel  in a marquee Android device counts as a coup for the US chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in. It was unclear whether the Samsung, the world’s largest manufacturer of tablets after Apple, plans other versions of the 10-inch Galaxy Tab carrying its own, or other companies’, processors. A spokeswoman for South Korea-based Samsung declined to comment. An Intel spokesman also declined to comment. The use of an Intel Clover Trail+ chip in the upcoming tablet was first reported on by VentureBeat and other blogs last week. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but was slow to make chips that appealed to makers of smartphones and tablets as the market boomed following Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and iPad in 2010. Applications processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung and Nvidia  now dominate a market that research firm Strategy Analytics estimated could hit $25 billion by 2016 versus $9 billion in 2011. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who took the helm this month, has stated that one of his top goals is to expand the Silicon Valley chipmaker’s footprint in mobile devices. Intel is rushing to adapt its powerful PC chips to use less energy and work more efficiently in mobile devices. It has so far scored a few minor “design wins”, getting its processors into a few mobile devices. For instance, an Intel mobile processor was used in a version of Motorola’s Razr smartphone launched last year in markets like Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany and Mexico. Intel has yet to launch chips capable of supporting high-speed Long Term Evolution technology, a major barrier to competing in mobile devices aimed at the United States, where the standard is becoming increasingly common. Samsung has nearly 18 percent of the market for tablets, according to IDC."
2012-07-09,10,"* $4.1 bln spending includes R&D, stake buy * Intel first to sign onto ASML investment program   (Adds executives’ and analyst’s comments, share action) By Edwin Chan SAN FRANCISCO, July 9 (Reuters) - Intel Corp will spend more than $4 billion to buy a stake in ASML and bankroll its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, a major vote of confidence in the Dutch company that sent its U.S. shares soaring 6 percent on Monday. Intel hopes to speed the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require intensive capital investment, but delivers billions of savings in future, analysts said. ASML, the world’s largest maker of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers and a barometer for the chip sector, may want to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge chipmaking equipment, based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Intel will acquire an initial 10 percent stake in its European supplier and add another 5 percent pending shareholders’ approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. It also benefits by being able to move on to larger wafer sizes. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman estimates Intel can save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. Under the agreement, Intel gains no exclusive rights to future ASML products. But Freedman said Intel, as the sector leader, stands to gain if the overall industry benefits. “I was a little surprised that ASML did not offer exclusivity or preferential access,” Freedman said. But “if in fact they’re lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets, you’re opening markets as well.” A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps also push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months. The world’s top chipmaker will also help finance $1 billion of research into 450mm and extreme-ultraviolet chipmaking, both cutting-edge technologies that had been expected to emerge in the decade’s second half. While many semiconductor companies outsource the fabrication of actual chips to third-party “foundries,” Intel is among the last remaining chipmakers that build and operate their own network of multibillion dollar production facilities, or “fabs”. “If Intel is able to ramp 450mm production ahead of the world’s fabs such as TSMC or Global Foundries et al, it may yet prove that real men have fabs,” said John Jackson from CCS Insight. “There are signs that the global semiconductor fabrication sector is poised to realign.” Intel is the first major chipmaker to sign up for ASML’s “customer investment” program, under which it hopes to enlist partners to fund expensive research into 450mm wafer technology, a more economical chipmaking process. Under their agreement, Intel will pay 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) for the initial 10 percent slice of ASML, and a preliminary 553 million euros for research. The pact also involves advance orders of next-generation ASML chipmaking gear, strengthening the Dutch firm’s assurance to move ahead in developing the technology. Intel shares slid about 1 percent to $25.87 after hours, from a close of $26.17 on Nasdaq. ASML shot up 6.3 percent to $51.53 from a close of $48.46. ASML competes with Japanese groups Canon  and Nikon. Its clients include Intel and Samsung Electronics.

2013-04-16,-2,"* Maintains full-year revenue forecast * Shares edge lower By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said its current-quarter revenue would decline as much as 8 percent and trimmed its 2013 capital spending plans, as personal computer sales drop due to the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones. Shares in the world’s largest chip maker rallied as much as 3 percent after hours but quickly gave up the gains. The stock had been battered over the past week after researcher IDC revealed that PC sales notched a record quarterly decline in the first quarter. Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, that amounts to roughly no change or a drop of as much as 8 percent. Analysts had expected $12.588 billion in revenue for the first quarter and $12.854 billion for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel posted first-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.74 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected 41 cents per share. “These numbers are not very solid, but the second-quarter guidance is better than feared. Conditions are probably not as bad as industry reports have suggested recently,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital. Shares of Intel edged down less than 1 percent in extended trade after closing up 2.5 percent at $21.91 on Nasdaq."
2014-01-07,-12,"Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich announced the decision to abandon the McAfee name late on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, saying the company plans to transition those products to the “Intel Security” brand. “I’ve been begging them to drop the brand or fix the product,” McAfee said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. He did not speculate on a reason for the move, which was not completely unexpected. Last June, McAfee appeared in a profanity-laced video attacking the quality of the software produced by the company he founded in the late 1980s. He said he frequently gets emails from customers who complain that it degrades the performance of their computers and is difficult to remove. “While we take any attack on our products seriously, these ludicrous statements have no basis in reality,” company spokesman Ian Bain said at the time. A company spokesman said on Tuesday he could not immediately comment on the branding move. But executives with the security company have privately said they worry that the eccentric McAfee could harm the reputation of the firm, best known for the anti-virus software it sells to consumers and businesses. Questions about Intel’s plans for keeping the McAfee brand arose in late 2012, when John McAfee generated a media frenzy as he went into hiding, then fled the Central American nation of Belize after police sought to question him about a murder case. He said he was framed for a murder he did not commit. Then in his video attacking the software, the millionaire fires a gun into a computer. He was undressed and pawed by a group of young women. McAfee said he did it all to mock the media’s unfair portrayal of him as unhinged. “I am who I am. I‘m sorry I live on the edge and enjoy life and don’t care what people think of me,” he said on Tuesday, when asked how he felt about Intel dumping his name. “I‘m sorry that the software has my name.”"
2015-10-09,-3,"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - World No. 1 chipmaker Intel Corp  will be given the go-ahead from the EU for its $16.7 billion bid for Altera Corp, its largest ever deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The U.S. company is looking to Altera to reinforce its portfolio of higher-margin chips used in data centres and to focus on chips for cars, watches and other devices in a future  “Internet of Things”. The U.S. Department of Justice cleared the deal unconditionally last month while other agencies such as the Chinese are also looking at the bid. Analysts had expected smooth sailing but some investors were concerned about possible antitrust hurdles. The highly fragmented chip industry has seen a wave of consolidation this year as companies beef up their capabilities and try to squeeze more technologies onto chips in response to demand for integrated suppliers. The European Commission will clear the deal without requiring concessions from Intel as it does not see any competition issues, the sources said. A decision is scheduled by Oct. 14. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Intel spokeswoman Cara Walker declined to comment on the regulatory process, saying the company continued to work closely and cooperate with the agencies involved. Altera makes programmable chips used to speed up web searches and update social networks, among other uses. The Commission is now examining Avago Technologies’  $37 billion offer for Broadcom Corp, the biggest ever deal in the sector. The preliminary review will end on Nov. 9.

2014-01-17,-10,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers, and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its enterprise customers, sending its stock lower, and pointed to political controversy in Washington, D.C. In the December quarter, Intel’s PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected. Microsoft Corp’s plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees’ PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter. Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry’s decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets. The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media. But Smith said Intel’s data center group revenues in 2014 would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. The 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected. “The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. “Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise.” Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc   and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. “We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter, and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,” he told analysts. But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. “The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,” Smith told Reuters. “What’s driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we’ve been working on.” At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices, including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers any time soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry. Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers. Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $13.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel slid 4.8 percent in extended-hours trading on Thursday after ending the regular session down 0.49 percent  at $26.54 on the Nasdaq. One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome. “You’re getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “This management team is not running this company to deliver earnings.”   (Editing by Matthew Lewis and Jan Paschal)"
2014-02-23,-4,"Chief Executive Michel Combes said Alcatel-Lucent wanted to gain market share but not at any cost, as it entered the second year of a three-year turnaround aimed at restoring regular profits and cutting 1 billion euros of costs. Analysts predicted that competition could intensify this year among telecom equipment vendors after Nokia’s NSN unit  forecast lower operating margins as it tries to rebuild revenues lost after a bout of restructuring. A newly aggressive NSN could spark reactions from Sweden’s Ericsson  and China’s Huawei. “All the players in the sector have understood that competition based on price was not the right answer,” Combes said on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress, the wireless industry’s largest annual conference. “Differentiation is the right way. Each company must find its areas of excellence and deliver on the services promised to customers,” he said. To that end, Combes unveiled a partnership with chip maker Intel, under which the two will share the costs of research and development on cloud computing and security. Known as “network function virtualization”, the technology allows telecom operators to rely more on software to run their networks and less on hardware, which can over time bring down costs. It is the second R&D partnership announced since Combes took over as CEO in April 2012, and he pledged more to come. Mobile chip maker Qualcomm took a undisclosed stake in Alcatel in July 2013 as part of a research partnership on so-called small cells, which are small mobile antennas to help operators cover urban areas. The Intel partnership does not involve any direct purchase of Alcatel’s shares, but Combes said the two would invest “several hundred million euros each” with the aim of possibly launching products for sale this year. “We can be first to market with products by working with partners,” said Combes. Alcatel-Lucent halved its net loss last year as Combes’ turnaround plan kicked in, helped by a capital increase and bond to shore up the company’s balance sheet and 10,000 layoffs. The shares have more than tripled in value in the past year and closed at 3.15 euros on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of 8.77 billion euros.

China’s government has been openly pushing for the use of more Chinese and less foreign-made technology, both to grow its own tech sector and as a response to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s leaks about widespread U.S. cyber surveillance. Earlier this week, U.S. President Barack Obama warned of a proposed anti-terrorism law’s impact on technology firms and international business, and demanded amendments. Other U.S. enterprise tech firms adopting a partnership strategy include IBM Corp, Dell Inc [DI.UL], Cisco Systems Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Juniper Networks Inc. The cloud computing industry is a focus area for China, with Premier Li Keqiang saying in his government work report delivered to parliament on Thursday that the government would support its development.

2015-07-15,-3,"* PC business revenue falls 13.5 pct * Shares rise as much as 9.2 pct after market   (Adds analysts comments, details; updates shares) By Abhirup Roy and Anya George Tharakan July 15 (Reuters) - Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday as growth in its data centers and Internet-of-Things businesses helped offset weak demand for personal computers that use the company’s chips. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker, which also cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast for the second time, rose as much as 9.2 percent after market before paring some of their gains. The company has been expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers to counter slowing demand from the PC industry and agreed to buy Altera Corp for $16.7 billion in April as part of these efforts. Revenue from the data center business, Intel’s second-largest, grew 9.7 percent to $3.85 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by continued adoption of cloud services and demand for data analytics. “We continue to forecast robust growth rates of the data center group, Internet of Things group and NAND businesses, which we expect to mostly offset the PC decline,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said on a post-earnings call. Revenue from the PC business, Intel’s largest, fell 13.5 percent to $7.54 billion in the quarter ended June 27. “Our expectations are that the PC market is going to be weaker than previously expected,” Smith said. Research firm Gartner forecast global PC shipments to fall 4.5 percent to 300 million units in 2015, with no respite until at least 2016. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also cut its 2015 capex forecast to $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. It had cut its full-year capex forecast to $8.7 billion from $10 billion in April. Intel’s continued focus on keeping spending down is probably the strongest positive in its quarterly report, Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said. The company's net income fell to $2.71 billion from $2.80 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, were flat at 55 cents as the number of outstanding shares fell. (bit.ly/1Hvmgay) Analysts had expected a profit of 50 cents per share. Net revenue fell 4.6 percent to $13.19 billion, but edged past the average analyst estimate of $13.04 billion.

2015-10-21,-4,"* Investment amid concerns about memory industry outlook * SK Hynix shares end 5.7 pct lower on earnings worries   (Adds industry background, analyst comment) Oct 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said it may invest up to $5.5 billion in manufacturing semiconductors in China, stepping up efforts to improve ties with Beijing as it seeks new revenue streams while demand for its core computer processing chips falters. The U.S. firm said it would convert a facility in Dalian, its first plant in China, for memory chip production. It didn’t disclose a time period for the investment, but said it will start making advanced memory chips that can store data without using up power, called 3D NAND chips, in second-half 2016. The move follows a flurry of deals in the global semiconductor industry, highlighting growing importance of the memory chips used to store data in increasingly popular mobile devices. Researcher TrendForce predicts China will consume $6.67 billion worth of NAND chips this year, or 29 percent of global NAND industry revenue. Building a chip industry of its own has been deemed of strategic importance by China in its drive to modernise its economy. Intel’s new investment follows a deal last year to buy 20 percent stake of two mobile chipmakers owned by state-backed Tsinghua Holdings Co Ltd. For its part Tsinghua recently announced a plan to buy a 15 percent stake in U.S. data storage company Western Digital Corp  for $3.8 billion. In separate deals, Western Digital is also in advanced talks to acquire U.S. memory chipmaker SanDisk Corp, while Tsinghua is also trying to acquire Micron, though this deal is facing regulatory scrutiny. Intel’s latest move raises concerns that new memory supply from the chipmaker could undercut margins for leading industry players like South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and SK Hynix Inx, and Japan’s Toshiba Corp. Analysts have said that healthy profits for the industry in recent quarters come partly due to careful capacity management among the dominant players. Shares of SK Hynix fell 5.7 percent on Wednesday on concerns about the firm’s outlook. The South Korean firm is due to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. “SK Hynix needs to boost competitiveness for its NAND business but these issues are creating problems for the company,” said Hana Financial Investment analyst Rokho Kim.

In separate deals, Western Digital is also in advanced talks to acquire U.S. memory chipmaker SanDisk Corp, while Tsinghua is also trying to acquire Micron, though this deal is facing regulatory scrutiny. Intel’s latest move raises concerns that new memory supply from the chipmaker could undercut margins for leading industry players like South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inx, and Japan’s Toshiba Corp.    Analysts have said that healthy profits for the industry in recent quarters come partly due to careful capacity management among the dominant players. Shares of SK Hynix fell 5.7 percent on Wednesday on concerns about the firm’s outlook. The South Korean firm is due to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. “SK Hynix needs to boost competitiveness for its NAND business but these issues are creating problems for the company,” said Hana Financial Investment analyst Rokho Kim.

2012-10-16,-4,"International Business Machines reported revenues below analysts’ targets with technology spending held back by a waning global economy, helping send its shares lower. Commentary Intel: ”The Q4 revenue forecast was not surprising, people have been wondering how weak that was going to be. It was fairly obvious that there aren’t tons of build from Windows 8, and that was the reason for the preannouncement. I guess they’re guiding up slightly on a sequential basis, typically in Q4 you do a lot more. Looks like they’re taking a fair amount of underutilization and just looking at the CFO comment. In terms of capital expenditure, “they took it down for the year and that’s normal. What they do in this environment is they will pull equipment off-line, and repurpose what they have for the next process.” “Some people will be disappointed by the fact that the datacenter business didn’t perform better. There was some thought that the data centers would continue to do well.” “They missed our gross margin assumptions. We were at 48.4 percent, they reported 48.1 percent. EPS is essentially flat year over year and they typically grow earnings double digits year over year. So all in all, pretty disappointing results from IBM.” "
2015-03-05,0,"The partnership, announced by Huawei in a statement, comes as U.S and other Western tech firms’ scramble to burnish their bona fides with China, which has become increasingly wary of foreign technology. Joining hands with Chinese companies, including technology transfers and adopting Chinese partners’ branding, can make these products more palatable to local buyers and authorities in the world’s second-largest economy. “How do you stay in this market and do the least damage to your core business - that’s the puzzle everybody is focusing on now,” said James McGregor, chairman for advisory firm APCO China. China’s government has been openly pushing for the use of more Chinese and less foreign-made technology, both to grow its own tech sector and as a response to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s leaks about widespread U.S. cyber surveillance. These policies have become a source of considerable friction in foreign relations. Earlier this week, U.S. President Barack Obama warned of a proposed anti-terrorism law’s impact on technology firms and international business, and demanded amendments. Other U.S. enterprise tech firms adopting a partnership strategy include IBM Corp, Dell Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Juniper Networks Inc. The cloud computing industry is a focus area for China, with Premier Li Keqiang saying in his government work report delivered to parliament on Thursday that the government would support its development. Intel and Huawei have collaborated previously, including a server and cloud product team-up in 2012 and an agreement to cooperate on data storage last April.

2014-02-23,-2,"BARCELONA, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Alcatel-Lucent said it would stay out of a brewing price war in the telecom equipment market and set itself apart with better service and new products, including those from a partnership announced on Sunday with Intel Corp. Chief Executive Michel Combes said Alcatel-Lucent wanted to gain market share but not at any cost, as it entered the second year of a three-year turnaround aimed at restoring regular profits and cutting 1 billion euros of costs. Analysts predicted that competition could intensify this year among telecom equipment vendors after Nokia’s NSN unit  forecast lower operating margins as it tries to rebuild revenues lost after a bout of restructuring. A newly aggressive NSN could spark reactions from Sweden’s Ericsson  and China’s Huawei. “All the players in the sector have understood that competition based on price was not the right answer,” Combes said on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress, the wireless industry’s largest annual conference. “Differentiation is the right way. Each company must find its areas of excellence and deliver on the services promised to customers,” he said. NSN Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said on Sunday that the group would not compete agressively on price across the board, despite its aim to return to revenue growth by the second half of the year. “It’s about being selective and targeted on pricing,” he said at a press conference. At Alcatel’s event, Combes unveiled a partnership with chip maker Intel under which the two will share the costs of research and development on cloud computing and security. Known as network function virtualization, the technology allows telecom operators to rely more on software to run their networks and less on hardware, which can over time bring down costs. Other telecom gear makers are also pitching such products. NSN said it had carried out over 50 commercial trials with carriers to explore such cloud technology. The Intel accord is the second R&D partnership announced since Combes took over as CEO in April 2012, and he pledged more to come. Mobile chip maker Qualcomm took an undisclosed stake in Alcatel in July 2013 as part of a research partnership on so-called small cells, which are small mobile antennas to help operators cover urban areas. The Intel partnership does not involve any direct purchase of Alcatel’s shares, but Combes said the two would invest “several hundred million euros each” with the aim of possibly launching products for sale this year. “We can be first to market with products by working with partners,” said Combes. Alcatel-Lucent halved its net loss last year as Combes’ turnaround plan kicked in, helped by a capital increase and bond to shore up the company’s balance sheet and 10,000 layoffs. The shares have more than tripled in value in the past year and closed at 3.15 euros on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of 8.77 billion euros."

However, gains, especially on the Nasdaq, were limited by Intel. The chipmaker tumbled 6 percent, weighing the most on major indexes, after its disappointing revenue forecast. The chip index dipped 0.54 percent. U.S. crude prices surged 3 percent to a 15-month high after a report showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles.

The financial sector has gained 1 percent since Thursday, a day before the banks started reporting, while the KBW bank index is up 2.1 percent.

2012-06-12,10,"Nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhone and iPad and Samsung’s (005930.KS) Galaxy S3, use processors based on ARM’s energy-efficient architecture. Intel, in turn, dominates the PC market, helped in no small part by Microsoft (MSFT.O) basing Windows on its x86 architecture, but its chips have failed to make inroads in mobile where battery life is critical. The U.S. company hopes that will change with the recent launch of handsets in China, India and last week in Europe, based on its Atom processor and backed by operator Orange FTE.PA. Warren East, chief executive of Cambridge-based ARM, said Intel’s phones were still a couple of generations behind the latest ARM-based smartphones. “I’ve played with the (Indian) phone and it’s a very good phone,” East told the Reuters Media and Technology Summit. “It’s very comparable with the Apple 3G (launched in 2008) in terms of browsing speed, and ease of user interface and so on.” But he did not perceive Intel “as a huge threat”. “We’ve been saying Intel will gain some share in the smartphone space,” he said in London. “However, we think it will be not be vast because they will be one of 20 companies supplying into that space, the others have the advantage of using the ARM architecture, and the last 10-15 years has been spent developing a very strong ecosystem around that architecture.” He said Intel were catching up in making microprocessors more efficient, but the ARM world continued to move ahead. East said ARM was working on the assumption that Intel would gain about 10 percent of the smartphone apps processor market in two to four years. “In a few years time, it will settle out at some number but we do not think it’s going to be much bigger than that,” he said. ARM’s blueprints are licensed to chipmakers, such as Samsung and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), which in turn pay a small royalty of 1-2 percent of the shipping price per chip. Electronics manufacturers and software designers also license the British firm’s technology, with the result that development costs are spread across the industry. While Intel could gain ground in smartphones, ARM is moving in the other direction into Intel’s territory. Later this year, PCs based on ARM’s architecture will launch, a milestone enabled by Microsoft (MSFT.O) configuring its Windows operating system for ARM’s architecture for the first time, enabling it to capture a chunk of the tablet market. East said an added benefit of Microsoft’s decision was that it opened the PC market up to ARM architecture. ”We don’t see why in due course we shouldn’t have a large share (of the PC market),“ he said. ”We are anticipating 10 percent, probably 20 percent in a few years, but why we should be able to go further is the business model. “In the ARM world you have 20 or so companies supplying apps processors into smartphones at the moment, and PC and smartphone functionality is becoming increasing similar: the chips are basically the same chips.” He said the launch later this year would be fairly muted, with around half a dozen products initially on sale. “I think for the launch and 2012, the important thing is proving the concept,” he said. “But Microsoft has a fantastic track record: virtually every PC on the planet is running Windows and I have no reason to doubt they won’t be able to do the same thing with an ARM-based version.” "

Union Pacific (UNP.N) dropped 3.4 percent after the No. 1 U.S. railroad posted a lower quarterly net profit, hurt by slumping freight volumes. The stocks dragged down the Dow Jones transport index .DJT, which is often seen as a barometer of the market’s health and the overall economy. “You’ve got some weakness in that important group, and the broader market might be taking some cues from that,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

The recent rally has pushed the S&P 500 to fresh all-time records after failing to reach such highs for more than a year, putting the benchmark index up about 6 percent in 2016. “The market is just tired,” said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer of Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco. “It’s had a massive move in a straight line and so it is only natural to see some pullback here.” Second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies, which have started reporting results in earnest this week, are expected to fall 3.3 percent, less severe than the 4.5 percent decline estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2012-09-24,4,"Not content to remain in the shadows of hot consumer brands like Apple or Samsung, chipmakers - including Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia  - want consumers to get to know the processors that power their mobile devices. They hope to build brand loyalty in the process. Intel is leading the charge by extending its hugely successful “Intel Inside” marketing campaign beyond personal computers. Launched in 1991, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. This year, the Intel Inside logo has appeared on the backs of smartphones launched in the United Kingdom, India and Russia. Intel hopes to bring the phone campaign to the United States next year, seeking a marketing advantage over rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which are not as well-known among consumers. “Without a doubt, my goal would be to have consumers walk into stores and have Intel Inside as a key driver of which phone or tablet they choose, just like we’ve done in the PC space,” said Brian Fravel, Intel’s head of branding. The world’s top chipmaker dominates the PC market but lags smaller competitors in the fast-growing mobile industry. Intel is flexing its branding muscle to try to catch up. It remains to be seen how many handset manufacturers agree to put the Intel Inside logo on their devices. For emerging smartphone brands, with little name recognition of their own, partnering with Intel may be a “no brainer.” At the other extreme, Apple refuses to share branding with any of its suppliers. The highest-profile smartphone maker so far to use Intel’s branding is Google’s Motorola Mobility, which launched the Razr i in London on Sept 18. Until now, space on most smartphones has been reserved for the vendor, such as Apple or Samsung, and carriers like Verizon Wireless. Providers of operating systems , such as Google’s Android, also covet consumer loyalty - their logos sometimes appear briefly on screens when devices are turned on. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks. “Can you generate end-user demand for your processors? That’s what they’re all looking at, and that’s not an easy thing to do in the mobile space where people aren’t accustomed to it,” said Jack Gold, a tech industry analyst at J. Gold Associates. Part of the reason the Intel Inside campaign has been unrivaled in the chip industry is that no one else can match Intel’s $2.1 billion annual budget for advertising and marketing. Intel helps pay for the PC makers’ own ads, as long as they include Intel Inside. A TV ad promoting a phone launched by Orange in the United Kingdom in February features a supersonic car driven by a dark-clad pilot whose clothes are emblazoned with Intel Inside. Intel surveyed customers who bought Orange’s phone. “It wasn’t as though these were tech-savvy people who were reading all the benchmarks. They said Intel Inside meant performance to them,” Intel’s Fravel said. Badly underestimating how quickly the mobile market would grow, Intel was slow to develop application processors, the punchy but energy-efficient chips that drive web surfing, games and other advanced features of smartphones and tablets. Along with Qualcomm, Samsung is a major producer of mobile processors, most of which it manufactures on behalf of Apple’s iPads and iPhones. Texas Instruments and Broadcom  also make mobile processors, but do not advertise much to consumers. Most of Qualcomm’s marketing has been directed at a specific category of tech enthusiasts keenly interested in the components used in their devices. It has taken the form of YouTube videos, Internet ads and social media instead of TV commercials and other pricey campaigns. In October, Qualcomm is set to start a new branding campaign, coinciding with the launch of tablets and other devices using its chips and Microsoft’s next-generation Windows platform. As part of the drive, Qualcomm will share advertising with manufacturers to showcase features of its chips, said Tim McDonough, a Qualcomm vice president responsible for marketing the company’s Snapdragon mobile processors. “You’ll start to see the Snapdragon brand appearing in a lot more places. But the key is having it appear in places where it has value to the user as a starting point. Right now, the consumer is saying, ‘I‘m ready for my next phone, I‘m not sure what to buy, and I need some help,'” McDonough said, in a telephone interview. McDonough would not say how much Qualcomm plans to spend on advertising to counter Intel, which last year even paid hit Korean pop group Girls’ Generation for TV ads and a single written for Intel. Signaling its growing interest in creating brand awareness, Qualcomm renamed a professional football venue in San Diego “Snapdragon Stadium” for a few days last year. And suggesting Qualcomm sees the PC industry as a model for its marketing, it hired a new chief marketing officer, Anand Chandrasekher, a veteran Intel senior executive, in August. Last year, Nvidia spent just $9.5 million on advertising, a sum that can’t buy anything close to Intel’s broad recognition. But it can help win loyalty from a narrow but influential group of young men. “Intel spends way more money branding Intel Inside, but we’ll go to events, and gamers will come up to us with the Nvidia logo tattooed on their body, shaved on their head,” said Ujesh Desai, Nvidia’s vice president of corporate marketing. Leveraging its popularity with game fans, Nvidia has created Tegra Zone, a collection of games optimized to work better on mobile devices using Nvidia’s Tegra processors. Ads for tablets like Google’s Nexus 7 boast of Nvidia’s punchy graphics. “Our tack doesn’t start with, ‘How much are we going to pay you so you put our logo on there?’ Our tack is more, ‘Here’s how we can partner with you so we can create a great experience,'” Desai said. With stagnant PC sales, executives see mobile gadgets as the future. Annual sales of processors used in smartphones and tablets could hit $25 billion by 2016, compared with $9 billion last year, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. As formidable as the Intel Inside brand may be, extending it from PCs to a new world of smartphones and tablets has risks. Competition in mobile is fierce. If Intel fails to deliver the top performance that people associate with “Intel Inside,” the chipmaker could damage its prized image. “Putting an ingredient brand on the outside of your product should be like driving a sports car, something you want people to see you do because it’s better,” said Andy Smith, a former Intel employee who was involved with the “Intel Inside” campaign in the late 1990s. “But if the reality is that there’s nothing great about the chips, then it’s going to be hard for them to repeat it.”"

2013-11-26,16,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed Intel Corporation’s  (Intel) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’ with a Stable Outlook. The  short-term IDR was also affirmed at ‘F1’. Fitch views Intel as one of the strongest credits in the technology space driven  by its position as the leading provider of microprocessors for PCs and servers  worldwide. The company’s manufacturing technology advantage has resulted in a  widening degree of differentiation from its competitors over the years. While  new competition has emerged recently in ARM-based processors for tablets and  smartphones, Fitch believes that the company’s dominance of x86 based processors  which are the most prevalent computing platform in the world will result in a  relatively stable market opportunity for the foreseeable future. Recently, Intel announced two modest changes to its longer-term strategy,  reflecting the growing challenges in the PC and mobile computing markets. The  company plans to move more aggressively in developing and bringing to market  processors for the convertible notebook, tablet and smartphone markets. By 2015,  Intel expects these processors to effectively be at par with its leading edge  solutions for the traditional PC market utilizing its most advanced 14nm  manufacturing technology. The company expects to incur a greater loss in this  segment of its business in 2014 as it invests in this development. Fitch  believes that Intel has begun to demonstrate that it can compete in the mobile  market but that 2014 will be a key window for it to develop meaningful market  share leading into 2015. Expectations for relative stability in the PC Client  segment in 2014 and solid growth in the Data Center segment provide some measure  of flexibility for Intel to manage through these market challenges over the next  few years at the current rating. Intel also announced that it intends to open its foundry service offerings more  broadly, potentially putting the company in position to manufacture chips for  direct competitors in the smartphone and tablet markets. Fitch believes that  this potential shift in the business is a net neutral development for the  credit. On one hand this could provide meaningful diversification in this part  of the market for the company during a time when it is spending aggressively on  new manufacturing process technology development and capacity expansion. This  should lessen the risk of Intel’s ultimate level of success in the smartphone  and tablet markets to the credit. Conversely, a broader offering of its foundry  services could potentially negate Intel’s manufacturing process technology  leadership as a key competitive advantage in a segment of the market where it is  significantly behind competitors in terms of market share. Fitch expects Intel  will choose whether or not to partner with potential competitors based on the  relative economics of either strategy as it expands these services over the next  few years. --Fitch expects the company to maintain a relatively conservative capital  structure and balanced approach to shareholder friendly actions. Fitch expects  leverage (total debt / EBITDA) to remain comfortably below 1x and for normalized  free cash flow to adjusted debt to range near 35% or above 50% before dividends. --Fitch expects share repurchases and the company’s dividend to be financed by  free cash flow. Fitch does expect Intel to continue to be acquisitive going  forward which could potentially be a source of additional modest debt financing. --Fitch believes that Intel’s new energy efficient processors targeted for  tablets and smartphones will begin to establish the company’s presence in that  market. Intel’s technology leadership in the semiconductor space is a  significant competitive advantage and its focus on this emerging market  opportunity should begin to produce returns over the next few years. Importantly, Fitch does not believe that Intel’s ultimate success in this market  is contingent on the success of Windows 8 or future Windows platforms. That said  greater consumer adoption of Windows 8 devices should materially aid Intel over  the next few years. The short-term rating reflects the significant liquidity resources Intel has on  balance sheet. The company had $4.9 billion of cash plus $14.3 billion in  short-term investments including marketable debt securities as of Sept. 30,  2013, to support its $3 billion commercial paper program. Intel has no revolving  credit facility. Intel’s ratings and outlook are supported by the following factors: --Intel is the dominant microprocessor vendor and maintains a clear and  significant technology advantage, particularly in manufacturing, over its  nearest competitors. --Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company’s revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability. --Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing. Credit concerns include: --Intel is exposed to the highly cyclical demand for semiconductors which is  typically exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel  inventory contraction. --The business model has high fixed costs, principally in R&D, in addition to  being highly capital intensive. Intel’s high profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has in recent times ranged near 50% of  EBITDA. --Intel has significant customer concentration with its 2 largest customers  representing 19% and 15% of revenue in 2011. --Potential technology shifts that reduce demand for Intel’s x86 solutions in  its core PC and server markets. This includes the potential for broader adoption  of ARM-based processing solutions beyond the smartphone and tablet markets. Liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2013, was solid with cash of $4.9 billion and a $3  billion commercial paper program which had no outstanding balance. Intel also  had $6.5 billion of short-term investments, $7.8 billion in trading assets and  $6.5 billion of marketable securities. Free cash flow of $6 billion over the  latest 12 month period further supports liquidity. The company does not have a  revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program but Fitch  views Intel’s strong liquidity as providing ample support for the program.  Total debt as of Sept. 30, 2013, was $13.5 billion consisting principally of:  $1.5 billion in 1.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2016, $3 billion in  1.35% senior unsecured notes due December 2017, $2 billion in 3.3% senior  unsecured notes due October 2021, $1.5 billion in 2.7% senior unsecured notes  due December 2022, $750 million in 4% senior unsecured notes due December 2032,  $1.6 billion principal value in 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due July  2035, $2 billion principal value in 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due  July 2039, $1.5 billion in 4.8% senior unsecured notes due October 2041, and  $924 million in 4.25% senior unsecured notes due December 2042. Intel also owes approximately $600 million to NVIDIA as part of a long-term  patent cross licensing agreement in 2011, payable over six years. This amount is  categorized under accrued liabilities. --If Intel is successful in solidifying its market position in the market for  smartphone and tablet processors while maintaining its high level of  profitability, it is possible the ratings could be positively impacted. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --If Intel is not successful in expanding its market share in the tablet and  smartphone market while consumer PC demand is further cannibalized by tablet  adoption, it is possible the ratings could be negatively impacted, potentially  resulting in a one or two notch downgrade over the next few years. --At the current rating level, Fitch would expect total debt / EBITDA to remain  comfortably below 1x and for free cash flow before dividends to represent 50% of  adjusted debt under normal conditions. If that free cash flow figure were to  fall closer to 20%, a rating in the ‘BBB’ category could be more appropriate.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for Intel: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+'; --Short-term IDR at ‘F1’; --$3 billion commercial paper program at ‘F1’; --Senior unsecured notes at ‘A+'; and --Junior subordinated notes at ‘A’. The Rating Outlook is Stable."

2012-05-15,5,"Riding the coat-tails of Intel’s most expensive marketing push in a decade, new processors from AMD have been chosen for a handful of upcoming laptops in a wave of sleek personal computers with features like “instant on” made popular by tablets. Targeting mainstream shoppers, thin laptops with AMD’s chips, previously code named Trinity, are set to sell in the $600 range, similar to many of the bulkier laptops now on the market and significantly cheaper than the high-end, Intel-powered ones increasingly appearing in stores. “It seems like an opportunity to steal the bacon and go in there and capture this huge opportunity that someone else generated,” AMD Chief Executive Rory Read told Reuters in an interview. “They missed where the sweet spot of the market was.” Intel has coined “Ultrabooks” to refer to svelte laptops using its processors, with high-quality features like solid-state drives and metal cases. AMD, always struggling to keep up with its much larger competitor, has been referring more generically to ultrathin laptops. Hewlett Packard last week unveiled a new “Sleekbook” lineup, with thin models using chips from both AMD and Intel. All three companies are counting on thin laptops to energize PC sales dulled by a growing preference for tablets. Intel, whose processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, has invested $300 million in an investment fund to help smaller companies develop technology to use in future Ultrabooks. The chipmaker’s executives last week said that by the holiday season, Ultrabooks will account for 40 percent of all consumer laptop sales. AMD’s Read said prices for Ultrabooks would be too high for Intel to hit that target. “You get up to those premium price points in a Windows type environment and there isn’t the scale to do that. But if you get into mainstream, there’s a big opportunity,” Read said. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, leading the Ultrabook push, said consumers would pay more for laptops with premium features, which next year will include touch displays. “We think the experience we’re delivering, people are going to be willing to pay for and it only gets better in 2013,” he told investors. Apple’s MacBook Air, seen by many consumers as the creme de la creme of laptops, sells for $999 and up. Analysts have speculated the Cupertino, California, company may drop the prices of future models in response to the Ultrabook push. While AMD stakes out territory at the low end of the price range for ultrathin laptops, analysts believe Intel may have trouble persuading consumers to spend extra on Microsoft Windows-based computers that lack the Apple brand. “It ultimately comes down to whether Intel is going to be able to enable the supply chain to develop an Ultrabook that is competitive with the MacBook Air at whatever new low price they’re going to be selling at,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners."

2012-01-12,5,"“It’s inevitable Intel will get a few smartphone design wins -- we regard Intel as a serious competitor,” said ARM CEO Warren East in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “Are they ever going to be the leaders in power efficiency? No, of course not. But they have a lot more to offer.” East rated Intel’s latest efforts as “good enough”, but not truly competitive with ARM’s designs. “They (Intel) have taken some designs that were never meant for mobile phones and they’ve literally wrenched those designs and put them into a power-performance space which is roughly good enough for mobile phones,” he said. Intel announced its long-expected entrance into the smartphone and tablet chip market earlier at CES, unveiling plans for Motorola Mobility and Lenovo phones running Google’s Android system on Intel’s new ‘Medfield’ chip. East, whose company licenses its designs to 275 chip makers and hardware and software firms, and controls the vast majority of the mobile market, said ARM was not standing still in the face of Intel’s charge. He said the company’s new Cortex A7 design had the same performance as chips in smartphones of only a few years ago, but at 20 percent of the power consumption. “People want to do more things with their phones, but battery size remains constant,” said East. “It’s like having a car with a fixed-size fuel tank and you want to drive 100 more miles. You’ve got to make the engine more efficient. That’s what we do for a living.” East said he was excited about seeing Microsoft Corp running its new Windows 8 operating system on tablets using ARM chip designs -- a significant shift in strategy from Intel’s most valuable long-term ally -- but said he could wait to make sure Microsoft gets it right. “We’ve waited a long time for this to happen. Another six months, another 12 months doesn’t matter,” said East. “I’d much rather wait however long it takes to get a quality experience than compromise.” Microsoft announced its plans to make Windows 8 ARM-compatible at last year’s CES, but has not publicly stated a release date for the new system. Industry-watchers are expecting a flurry of ARM-based, Windows 8-compatible tablets in the second half of this year, and East thinks the software giant can make an impact on the mobile computing market, where it has lagged Apple Inc and Google in recent years. “Google’s Android is flavor of the month, flavor of the year, and we certainly want to be part of the Google success,” said East. “But there is a space for Microsoft, and we very much want to be a part of that success too.” "

2014-07-29,-4,"The Sunnyvale, California, company disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday with first fiscal quarter revenue and second-quarter revenue outlook that missed expectations due to a declining legacy business, sending its shares 4 percent lower after hours.  But Applied Micro Circuits also announced it is shipping its new X-Gene “microserver” chips, made with intellectual property licensed from ARM Holdings, whose low-power technology is widely used in smartphones.  In the quarter that ended in June, Applied Micro Circuits recognized its first revenue from the chips - about a $1 million - and the company said it expects “meaningful” revenue from the chips in the quarters ending in December and March as shipments build.  “There is backlog today on the books for X-Gene, both in the September quarter and December quarter, as well as the March quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Paramesh Gopi told analysts on a conference call.  While microservers have yet to be meaningfully adopted, proponents say data centers can be made more cost effective and energy efficient by using them instead of Intel’s brawny server chips. Intel dominates the server market and it stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share.   “While we don’t take any competition lightly, the much-hyped threat of ARM servers getting any significant market segment share any time soon has been vastly overplayed,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder. In January, Facebook Inc hardware guru Frank Frankovsky lauded low-power server technology and said he looked forward to greater choice of processors.

2014-07-29,-4,"The Sunnyvale, California, company disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday with first fiscal quarter revenue and second-quarter revenue outlook that missed expectations due to a declining legacy business, sending its shares 4 percent lower after hours. But Applied Micro Circuits also announced it is shipping its new X-Gene “microserver” chips, made with intellectual property licensed from ARM Holdings, whose low-power technology is widely used in smartphones. In the quarter that ended in June, Applied Micro Circuits recognized its first revenue from the chips - about a $1 million - and the company said it expects “meaningful” revenue from the chips in the quarters ending in December and March as shipments build. “There is backlog today on the books for X-Gene, both in the September quarter and December quarter, as well as the March quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Paramesh Gopi told analysts on a conference call. While microservers have yet to be meaningfully adopted, proponents say data centers can be made more cost effective and energy efficient by using them instead of Intel’s brawny server chips. Intel dominates the server market and it stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share. “While we don’t take any competition lightly, the much-hyped threat of ARM servers getting any significant market segment share any time soon has been vastly overplayed,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder. In January, Facebook Inc hardware guru Frank Frankovsky lauded low-power server technology and said he looked forward to greater choice of processors.

2013-03-26,8,"The fellowships are part of a broader movement to encourage encore careers spearheaded by Encore.org, a non-profit led by Marc Freedman, a leading thinker and author on the topic. Much is at stake. While Washington worries about the growing burden of entitlement spending to support an aging population, programs like Encore are focused on leveraging the experience of millions of retirees for the greater good. Continued participation in the labor force is a net positive for the economy and the federal budget - and it can boost retirement security down the road for seniors by allowing them to delay filing for Social Security, and by adding to retirement saving accounts. At the same time, Encore appeals to the instinct for a second act that is so prevalent in the baby boomer generation. Intel isn’t the only company to experiment with this type of retirement transition program. There have been encore fellows in 15 states and the District of Columbia, and dozens of companies and foundations have participated in the program. Hewlett-Packard Co is a founding sponsor of the program and Goldman Sachs Group Inc has also participated. The fellows program is still in its pilot phase, but it has the potential to ramp up into a major program at Intel - and it’s off to a strong start. Forty employees are working as fellows, and another 80 are in the pipeline, says Julie Wirt, Intel’s global retirement design manager. “We wanted something that would work for all of our U.S. employees, no matter what previous work history,” she says. “And we thought this would bring tremendous value to nonprofits. The numbers are higher than we anticipated, and it’s one of the benefits our people are aware of more than any others.” Indeed, participation is coming from all parts of the company. A construction project manager is doing similar work for a Portland, Oregon non-profit, while an engineer from Massachusetts is working as a site manager in Florida for Habitat for Humanity. Hodshire put her expertise in sophisticated, robotics-based microprocessor manufacturing to work helping Roadrunner reorganize its warehouse operations to improve its process flow. “I’d been feeling anxiety about separating from the company,” she says. “I had a feeling like, ‘I‘m no good anymore - I‘m going to be put out to pasture. I knew I didn’t want to sit at home on a rocking chair, that just isn’t my style.” The shift into non-profit work has been a culture shock - but in a wonderful way, Hodshire says. “As a manufacturing supervisor, you’re accustomed to giving orders - making sure goals are met, no deviation. You investigate and analyze outputs,” says Hodshire. “I often felt like an extension of my machinery.” “At the food bank, everything is different,” she says. “The equipment is archaic, and the budgeting is hand-to-mouth. But people have a pride in their work and their mission that I haven’t seen in many people. And the job satisfaction is enormous. I know when I make the operation more efficient, the faster we can deliver food to needy people in New Mexico. And that is a human reward that is priceless.” Hodshire’s fellowship at the food bank draws to a close at the end of April, but she plans to continue working in non-profits, probably with a combination of volunteer and paid work. She retired with a lump sum pension payout and Social Security. “I‘m okay financially, but don’t want to work for no pay at all,” she says. “Maybe I haven’t grown enough to say I’ll do it just for love. But I don’t need to make as much, maybe enough to pay for gas and a couple of little things.” “I’ve discovered a passion within me and I want to feel that I’ve used the end of my life to accomplish something that will help people,” she adds.

2013-06-19,9,"Incoming chief executive Simon Segars said the British company’s power efficient technology was deeply embedded in smartphones and tablets because it was licensed so widely, saving chipmakers development costs and ensuring compatibility. ARM licenses its technology to partners like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Nvidia, Broadcom BRCM.O and MediaTek, which use the blueprints to make their own chips. ARM-based chips are used in nearly all smartphones and tablets, but the company faces growing competition from Intel, which was slow to react to the mobile revolution but is showing signs of becoming competitive. Last month the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its Atom mobile processors to date. Intel’s stock has risen about 5 percent since it gave an overview of the new technology, while ARM’s shares have fallen around 19 percent. The U.S. chipmaker also scored a major victory earlier this month when Samsung said it would use an Intel mobile chip to power its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch tablet. Segars said ARM had always expected Intel to gain some design wins, but he said the British company would retain the largest share of the mobile market. “We have always considered (Intel) to be a formidable company,” he said at the Reuters Global Technology Summit in San Francisco. But he said ARM was developing products that delivered the right performance at the lowest possible power consumption by focusing on the whole system, including how data moved around the chip and how the processor and graphics interacted. “We think that what we are doing in terms of that roadmap - the execution, the way we work with our partners - keeps our technology ahead,” he said on Wednesday. ARM unveiled its newest line of processors, the Cortex A-12, earlier this month, aimed at the fast growing $200-$350 smartphone segment, which the company says will number half a billion devices by 2015. It also launched a partner line in its Mali graphics processors and it first video processing technology, and the designs to join them all together. Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told the Reuters Global Technology Summit on Tuesday that his company would license its technology to other chipmakers to take greater advantage of the booming market for mobile computing. Segars said that, like in main processors, the strength of its graphic solution lay in its compatibility with the rest of the ARM ecosystem. “We think we have a pretty solid line of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units),” he said. “It’s about doing a great job of implementation, technical synergy with the rest of the key building blocks in the processor, and I think us doing all of that together means we can hopefully deliver a great solution to our customers.” Segars, who is currently based in California, has worked at ARM for 22 years. He takes over from Warren East on July 1. It is the first change at the top since 2001, but Segars said he was not planning any big overhauls. He said the collegiate atmosphere of the company, which reflects its base in the university city of Cambridge in east England, was a strength he wanted to retain. “For me, the priority is keep doing what we are doing because we do it well and make sure we capitalize on the new opportunities that we see,” he said.

2012-09-24,-19,"In sentencing Goel, 54, to two years probation, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones said his cooperation with the government “did go beyond” ordinary assistance, which his lawyers and prosecutors described in their pre-sentencing briefs. Jones fined Goel $10,000 and ordered him to forfeit $266,000. Goel, who has not worked since losing his job as treasury group manager with chipmaker Intel following his October 2009 arrest, pleaded guilty in February 2010 to being part of Rajaratnam’s network of insiders feeding him corporate secrets. The charges of securities fraud and conspiracy carried a maximum prison term of 25 years. Galleon Group hedge fund founder Rajaratnam, who was convicted of 14 charges of securities fraud and conspiracy by a jury, is serving an 11-year prison term. Rajaratnam’s appeal of secretly recorded telephone calls used by the FBI to gather evidence is scheduled to be heard on October 25. Goel told the sentencing judge that in helping Rajaratnam, “I had a serious lapse of judgment and good sense and I deeply apologize ... I hope that I am given another chance to repair the harm that I have caused.” His lawyer, David Zornow, in requesting a non-custodial sentence, described Rajaratnam as a “master manipulator” and a “clever seducer” of his friends. At Rajaratnam’s trial, Goel told the jury that they met at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s. In 2007 and 2008, Goel gave Rajaratnam confidential information about Intel’s business. U.S. prosecutor Reed Brodsky told the judge on Monday that Goel’s cooperation and testimony were essential “in a very significant prosecution for the government.” Brodsky said Goel’s assistance was relevant in six of the 14 charges against Rajaratnam. Two other former associates of Rajaratnam were also sentenced to two years probation following their trial testimony. They were Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant who also met Rajaratnam at Wharton, and former Galleon money manager Adam Smith.

His trial is scheduled to begin in May. “In a letter he (Brodsky) said the government had a person who provided confidential information to Raj Rajaratnam about Apple and Intel,” Naftalis said. “There is also wiretap evidence, substantial evidence of another source at Goldman Sachs.” Naftalis told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff that the defense believed “there is a much more circumstantial case that person should be sitting in the box rather than us” and “the wrong man is on trial here.” A theme of Gupta’s defense is that the charges brought by U.S. prosecutors last October are circumstantial and that Rajaratnam had a host of sources tipping him with information. A jury convicted Rajaratnam largely on wiretaps, which traditionally have been used in organized crime and narcotics cases, not white-collar investigations. Rajaratnam, once a friend of Gupta‘s, is serving an 11-year prison sentence. Gupta was onetime global head of McKinsey & Co and sat on the boards of several companies. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment. Goldman has been in the spotlight this week with the public resignation of employee Greg Smith, who said in a New York Times op-ed that Goldman had become “as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it” and was a place he no longer wished to work. The sources declined to be identified because the matter is not public. Neither Loeb nor King has been accused of any wrongdoing and neither responded to emails asking for comment. The insider-trading case has drawn in Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who was interviewed under oath on February 24 as a witness, according to court documents.

Intel shares were down 4.3 percent at $34.14 after it reported slowing revenue growth at its key data center business. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P and Nasdaq. It also pulled the S&P technology index 0.5 percent lower. Fellow chipmaker Qualcomm was the biggest positive influence on the S&P and Nasdaq, rising 7.4 percent after its results and forecast topped estimates. Biogen was up 6.9 percent at $280.42 after strong results. The stock led the health sector 0.35 percent higher, making it the only gainer among the 10 major S&P sectors. Southwest Airlines fell 8.7 percent and weighed on other airline stocks after it forecast a drop in a key profitability metric for the third quarter. At 12:43 p.m. ET (1643 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 80.61 points, or 0.43 percent, at 18,514.42. The S&P 500 was down 6.44 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,166.58. The index had earlier come within a point of its previous record. The Nasdaq Composite was down 10.24 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,079.70. “The recent rally has been more shallow and has been confined to a few sectors,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “Any pullback was to be expected given that the Dow rallied for nine straight days and you have to see today’s action in that context. The broader macro context hasn’t changed.” The S&P is up more than 6 percent for the year, while the Dow’s nine-day winning streak is its best run since March 2013. But the rally has been driven by defensive sectors such as telecoms and utilities amid concerns about global instability including Britain’s recent vote to leave the European Union. Even upbeat economic data did not influence the market. A report showed U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a three-month low last week, while home resales unexpectedly rose in June to their fastest pace in more than nine years.

2013-01-07,-2,"Sharp is fighting for survival after years of losses. Like other Japanese brands that spearheaded the 1970s electronics boom, it is wilting under stiffening competition and a strong yen. In November, it said it may not be able to survive on its own after full-year net losses to doubled to $5.6 billion. To repay short-term debt and stave off failure, the maker of Aquos televisions snagged a $4.4 billion bailout in October from its banks. But it is now exploring further options. “Our finances have been weakened considerably and we are considering ways to deal with that,” Sharp Vice President Kozo Takahashi told reporters at a roundtable briefing on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Sharp’s shareholder-equity ratio at the end of September was 9.9 percent - half the minimum level generally considered stable by investors. Takahashi described that only as “low.” Takahashi’s comments on Monday indicated that no new agreement was imminent. He did not elaborate on Sharp’s funding options, except to say that any future cash injections might not be limited to just share offers. Unlike local rivals Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp, Sharp faces limited financing alternatives because it had to mortgage nearly all of its Japanese factories and offices to secure last year’s bailout. It has much less scope to sell assets to underpin its finances, making partnerships with other companies likelier. In December, Qualcomm Inc agreed to invest as much as $120 million in Sharp. As part of that agreement, Qualcomm will work with Sharp to develop new, power-saving screens based on Sharp’s IGZO technology. Qualcomm made an initial investment of 4.93 billion yen ($56.20 million) at the end of the year in a private placement of stock, giving the U.S. company a 2.64 percent stake after dilution. The timing and amount of the remaining investment will be conditional on Sharp’s returning to profit in the six months ending March 31. Sharp has also been in talks for months with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, with an eye to making the Taiwanese company a major shareholder. Talks, however, stalled after Hon Hai said it expected a say in management in return. Current discussions with the Taiwanese company do not cover any partnership in small LCD displays, Takahashi said, such as those for cellphones. Hon Hai already owns a third of Sharp’s 10th-generation large-LCD plant in Sakai, in western Japan, dubbed the most advanced display factory in the world. Sharp may sell its TV assembly plant in Mexico to Hon Hai; talks to sell the Taiwanese company another factory in China have frozen, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in December. "

2015-01-15,0,"The report, sponsored by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was in response to President Barack Obama’s call last year for a review of potential software-based alternatives to the controversial program. “There are no technical alternatives that can accomplish the same functions as bulk collection and serve as a complete substitute for it; there is no technological magic,” the report said. The program came to light following explosive revelations in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. government was collecting and storing bulk telephone records of calls made to and from U.S. citizens. NSA eavesdroppers collected only so-called “metadata” – the time, length and phone numbers of the calls – and not actual content.  Intelligence officials maintain that collecting telephone metadata in bulk is critical to U.S. counter-terrorism efforts. However, a blue-ribbon panel set up by Obama following Snowden’s revelations reported it could find no evidence that sweeping collection of the telephone metadata of Americans led to a single major counter-terrorism breakthrough.  The National Research Council report focused on the technology of all types of electronic communication and not just domestic telephone metadata.  “A choice to eliminate all forms of bulk collection would have costs in intelligence capabilities,” Council researchers, who came from universities across the country and top technology companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), said in the report.  They did say, however, that it might be possible in some cases to develop techniques that improve targeting and provide a viable substitute for bulk collection. The report also said some methods could be developed to help allay privacy and civil liberties concerns. It suggested approaches such as automated systems for isolating data, restricting queries relating to the information and auditing its use. "
2012-08-01,-8,"Adil Othmane, an army spokesman in Tripoli, confirmed the incident and said it was under investigation. He attributed the attack to the absence of security guards. It was the third time the building had been attacked this year. For many residents of Benghazi, where the revolt that toppled long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi began, the building symbolizes the oppression they endured at the hands of his government. “This building doesn’t mean anything to me, it’s just a dusty building ... Under Gaddafi, nobody could dare to get close to this building,” 38-year-old Ibrahim Almosraty said, as he scrutinized the two-storey building’s damaged facade. Wednesday’s blast was one of a number of attacks in Benghazi, where local groups have also staged protests demanding more powers for eastern Libya and objecting to what they say is the central authorities’ neglect of the region. Bouzrida had a good reputation in the city because he joined the rebels in the early stages of the revolution and helped them gain control of the city, the source said. Last week, a hand grenade was thrown at the city’s law courts, without causing casualties. Police are struggling to identify suspects after the disparate attacks. “This is a message to tell the world that Benghazi is not safe so that nobody comes here with projects ... or to sign contracts in Benghazi,” said Emad Al-Khofaify, a jobless 30-year old. “Some people want Benghazi to pay the price for starting the revolution against Gaddafi.” "

U.S. President Barack Obama has warned of consequences should Assad use the weapons, with the White House citing “contingency planning” when asked about the possibility of military intervention. Panetta restated Obama’s warning of consequences for Assad on Thursday, adding: “I‘m not going to speculate or comment on what those potential consequences would be.” “But I think it’s fair enough to say that their use of those weapons would cross a red line for us,” he said."

2012-07-25,-1,"Intel’s global investment arm has invested in more than 60 companies in Israel since 1996. It has had a number of successful exits including: Anobit, which was acquired by Apple  ; Passave, acquired by PMC-Sierra ; and Gteko, bought by Microsoft, while Mellanox went public on Nasdaq. Marcos Battisti, managing director of Intel Capital for Western Europe and Israel, said investment returns have been in the double digits the last five years. “But it’s not as good as it could have been,” he told a news conference, saying returns in Israel lag those of the “high double digits” for Western Europe. Battisti cited the lack of staff in Israel that could adequately seek out investments. The local office had just one person but Intel Capital has added two venture capital veterans. “We realised we have missed opportunities here,” Battisti said. So, “we will be more aggressive.” He said a key goal of Intel Capital is to lead investments in Israeli companies. Investments will be made at all stages and could be $100,000 at an early stage or $50 million in a more advanced stage. Intel Capital typically invests $300-$500 million a year, although it reached $526 million in 2011. In 2012 Intel Capital has invested $198 million in 33 new deals - 56 percent of which were outside of North America. Battisti declined to say whether any deals in Israel were imminent but Intel Capital has met several companies of late. It was looking to invest in perceptional computing - the next generation user interface - communications, gaming, cloud, mobile ecosystem and consumer internet companies. Intel, the world’s No. 1 chipmaker, has four development centres in Israel and two plants, employing over 8,000 workers."
2012-09-24,3,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - As the mobile computing wars heat up, chipmakers that supply the crucial components inside smartphones and tablets aim to grab more of the glory. Not content to remain in the shadows of hot consumer brands like Apple or Samsung, chipmakers - including Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia  - want consumers to get to know the processors that power their mobile devices. They hope to build brand loyalty in the process. Intel is leading the charge by extending its hugely successful “Intel Inside” marketing campaign beyond personal computers. Launched in 1991, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. This year, the Intel Inside logo has appeared on the backs of smartphones launched in the United Kingdom, India and Russia. Intel hopes to bring the phone campaign to the United States next year, seeking a marketing advantage over rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which are not as well-known among consumers. “Without a doubt, my goal would be to have consumers walk into stores and have Intel Inside as a key driver of which phone or tablet they choose, just like we’ve done in the PC space,” said Brian Fravel, Intel’s head of branding. The world’s top chipmaker dominates the PC market but lags smaller competitors in the fast-growing mobile industry. Intel is flexing its branding muscle to try to catch up. It remains to be seen how many handset manufacturers agree to put the Intel Inside logo on their devices. For emerging smartphone brands, with little name recognition of their own, partnering with Intel may be a “no brainer.” At the other extreme, Apple refuses to share branding with any of its suppliers. The highest-profile smartphone maker so far to use Intel’s branding is Google’s Motorola Mobility, which launched the Razr i in London on Sept 18. Until now, space on most smartphones has been reserved for the vendor, such as Apple or Samsung, and carriers like Verizon Wireless. Providers of operating systems , such as Google’s Android, also covet consumer loyalty - their logos sometimes appear briefly on screens when devices are turned on. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks. “Can you generate end-user demand for your processors? That’s what they’re all looking at, and that’s not an easy thing to do in the mobile space where people aren’t accustomed to it,” said Jack Gold, a tech industry analyst at J. Gold Associates. Part of the reason the Intel Inside campaign has been unrivaled in the chip industry is that no one else can match Intel’s $2.1 billion annual budget for advertising and marketing. Intel helps pay for the PC makers’ own ads, as long as they include Intel Inside. A TV ad promoting a phone launched by Orange in the United Kingdom in February features a supersonic car driven by a dark-clad pilot whose clothes are emblazoned with Intel Inside. Intel surveyed customers who bought Orange’s phone. “It wasn’t as though these were tech-savvy people who were reading all the benchmarks. They said Intel Inside meant performance to them,” Intel’s Fravel said. Badly underestimating how quickly the mobile market would grow, Intel was slow to develop application processors, the punchy but energy-efficient chips that drive web surfing, games and other advanced features of smartphones and tablets. Along with Qualcomm, Samsung is a major producer of mobile processors, most of which it manufactures on behalf of Apple’s iPads and iPhones. Texas Instruments and Broadcom  also make mobile processors, but do not advertise much to consumers. Most of Qualcomm’s marketing has been directed at a specific category of tech enthusiasts keenly interested in the components used in their devices. It has taken the form of YouTube videos, Internet ads and social media instead of TV commercials and other pricey campaigns. In October, Qualcomm is set to start a new branding campaign, coinciding with the launch of tablets and other devices using its chips and Microsoft’s next-generation Windows platform. As part of the drive, Qualcomm will share advertising with manufacturers to showcase features of its chips, said Tim McDonough, a Qualcomm vice president responsible for marketing the company’s Snapdragon mobile processors. “You’ll start to see the Snapdragon brand appearing in a lot more places. But the key is having it appear in places where it has value to the user as a starting point. Right now, the consumer is saying, ‘I‘m ready for my next phone, I‘m not sure what to buy, and I need some help,'” McDonough said, in a telephone interview. McDonough would not say how much Qualcomm plans to spend on advertising to counter Intel, which last year even paid hit Korean pop group Girls’ Generation for TV ads and a single written for Intel. Signaling its growing interest in creating brand awareness, Qualcomm renamed a professional football venue in San Diego “Snapdragon Stadium” for a few days last year. And suggesting Qualcomm sees the PC industry as a model for its marketing, it hired a new chief marketing officer, Anand Chandrasekher, a veteran Intel senior executive, in August. Last year, Nvidia spent just $9.5 million on advertising, a sum that can’t buy anything close to Intel’s broad recognition. But it can help win loyalty from a narrow but influential group of young men. “Intel spends way more money branding Intel Inside, but we’ll go to events, and gamers will come up to us with the Nvidia logo tattooed on their body, shaved on their head,” said Ujesh Desai, Nvidia’s vice president of corporate marketing. Leveraging its popularity with game fans, Nvidia has created Tegra Zone, a collection of games optimized to work better on mobile devices using Nvidia’s Tegra processors. Ads for tablets like Google’s Nexus 7 boast of Nvidia’s punchy graphics. “Our tack doesn’t start with, ‘How much are we going to pay you so you put our logo on there?’ Our tack is more, ‘Here’s how we can partner with you so we can create a great experience,'” Desai said. With stagnant PC sales, executives see mobile gadgets as the future. Annual sales of processors used in smartphones and tablets could hit $25 billion by 2016, compared with $9 billion last year, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. As formidable as the Intel Inside brand may be, extending it from PCs to a new world of smartphones and tablets has risks. Competition in mobile is fierce. If Intel fails to deliver the top performance that people associate with “Intel Inside,” the chipmaker could damage its prized image. “Putting an ingredient brand on the outside of your product should be like driving a sports car, something you want people to see you do because it’s better,” said Andy Smith, a former Intel employee who was involved with the “Intel Inside” campaign in the late 1990s. “But if the reality is that there’s nothing great about the chips, then it’s going to be hard for them to repeat it.”"

2015-06-05,6,"In fact, the two main companies left in the programmable chip business - Xilinx Inc (XLNX.O) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) - are likely to benefit, analysts say. With Altera becoming part of Intel, the San Jose-based company is likely to focus on the x86 microprocessors made by the world’s biggest chip company, rather than those made by companies such as ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L. Altera now provides chips for both x86 and ARM-based processors. “(The combined Intel-Altera) will likely become x86 centric and neglect the large and growing ARM-based applications,” said Xilinx’s senior vice president of strategy, Steve Glaser. That gives Xilinx and Lattice the opportunity to take a bigger share of the ARM-based market - Xilinx at the high end and Lattice at the low end. Lattice Chief Executive Darin Billerbeck told Reuters this week he expected the Intel-Altera deal to increase his company’s total addressable market by $300-$400 million. “I think within communications and the industrial, we’ll see some of the benefit right away,” he said. Programmable-chips are used in everything from smartphones to cars and can be combined with computing processors to speed up servers in data centers. Intel processors are geared to function with high-performance desktops and servers, and consume a lot of power. ARM-based processors are more power-efficient as they take less time to perform a function, making them suited for smartphones. Intel has said that combining Altera’s chips with its own server processors, such as the x86, will let it offer twice the computing power. “SECOND CLASS CITIZEN” However, analysts said customers looking for faster microprocessors may now become concerned about becoming overly dependent on Intel. Many may prefer to do business with a company that only makes programmable-chips, such as Xilinx and Lattice, they said. “I think (Xilinx) is going to continue to gain market share ... I think Lattice should benefit as well,” Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said. Intel may well assign programmable chips to “second-class-citizen priority, where fussing over customers is alien,” analysts at brokerage Raymond James wrote in a client note. Lattice’s market-share gains are likely to last longer than Xilinx‘s, given its focus on the low end of the market, an area that is not likely to be a priority for Intel, analysts said. Xilinx, though, could face stiffer competition down the road after Intel and Altera fully integrate and start offering new products. Intel has said it will take six-to-nine months to close its deal with Altera. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington, who covers Xilinx, said the company had the opportunity to grow in the programmable chip market for the next two years. After that it “invites the question of who will win and succeed,” he said. Xilinx’s shares have risen about 18 percent and Lattice’s about 2.5 percent since March 27 when the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel and Altera were in talks. An Intel spokesman declined to comment for this story. Altera did not respond to a request for comment. "

2012-06-21,0,"Demand for these is seen rising around 40 percent annually through 2014, according to Nomura research, while growth in PC processors will be in single digits. By 2015, the global market for application processors (AP) will have jumped fourfold to $33 billion, while the CPU market will shrink by more than a tenth to $34 billion, according to NH Investment & Securities. That’s good news for leading AP makers such as Samsung, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and mobile chip designer ARM Holdings. Intel has yet to set a marker in the mobile chip market. Samsung, which leads the market in memory chips that are used in computers, is converting some memory chip production lines to logic chips and will invest close to $2 billion in a new logic chip plant in South Korea, in a clear bet that smartphones and tablets will be the real growth driver for a $311 billion global semiconductor industry that is being shaken up by the rapid advances in technology and consumer gadgetry. “The overall competition landscape will change as the boundary between CPU and AP blurs, with Intel trying mobile chips, and the performance of ARM-based APs improving to the level of CPU ... That indicates Samsung’s ultimate target could be Intel and Qualcomm,” said Greg Nho at HMC Investment & Securities. Francis Sideco, analyst at research firm IHS iSuppli, predicted Samsung could overtake Intel in overall semiconductor output. “It’s possible,” he said. “But that would need Samsung to expand its (AP) customer base beyond themselves and Apple. Also, Intel would have to completely miss the boat on its mobile ambitions.” Samsung has a headstart as it builds application processors that power the world’s most popular smartphones and tablets - the iPhone, iPad and Samsung’s own Galaxy products. Intel has little presence in this dynamic market. In April, India’s little-known Lava International launched its Xolo X900 smartphone, the first to use Intel’s new Medfield processor. Intel chips will also be used in some smartphones from Lenovo, Google’s Motorola Mobility and others. This will give Intel an entrance to the mobile market, but it has yet to rival mainstream mobile chips such as Apple’s A5, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon and Samsung’s Exynos processors. “How big they get and how fast remains to be determined ... I don’t think anyone expects these to be mega hits, but rather proof of concept,” said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. “Samsung is betting that mobile processor market growth will further accelerate when Windows 8 is released, which will use ARM-based application processors, and that’s partly behind its aggressive capacity expansion,” said NH Investment & Securities analyst Lee Sun-tae. Longer-term, it suggests application processors can be used in computers, encroaching on the market for central processing units (CPU), where Intel is leader. “Samsung is expected to gain a toehold in the CPU market to be in direct competition with Intel, as power-efficient ARM-based application processors, which Samsung makes, will square off with Intel chips, which boast high performance but need to improve power efficiency,” said Seo Won-seok, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. “Catching Intel would require significant growth in memory market share along with an Intel stumble,” said Mike Howard, an analyst at iSuppli. “While there are challenges for Samsung to continue to grow market share in memory (chips)... I would anticipate a major alliance, long-term, between Intel and another major memory company to rival Samsung.” In 2001, Intel’s market share was 14.9 percent, more than three times Samsung’s 3.9 percent. While Intel’s share has since stagnated, Samsung’s has increased to above 9 percent, prompting Intel to make acquisitions and expand into memory chips. Its market share was at a decade-high last year, boosted by rising sales of NAND flash memory chips and its acquisition of Infineon’s wireless chip business. Now Samsung is chipping away at that gap again, and is expected to switch more of its memory chip lines to produce the chips used in tablets and smartphones. For its part, Intel is betting its 2-year lead in manufacturing technology will help it keep ahead, and the Santa Clara, California-based firm is speeding up the rate at which it uses its most advanced factories to make mobile chips. “Although ARM-camp players are also likely to enter 20-22 nm geometry in 2013, Intel should still be a step ahead of the competition as it already produced the 22 nm-based Ivy Bridge CPU for the computer market in 2012,” Nomura analysts wrote in a recent note. “It’s premature to forecast who will be the winner or if Intel’s entrance will pose any substantial threat to the ARM camp, given that ARM architecture is unarguably ahead of (Intel‘s) x86 APs in power consumption, while production costs are also lower.” “What Samsung needs to address first is to diversify its customer base and make standard chips for a variety of customers - as Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Nvidia do,” said HMC’s Nho. Those firms’ chips are found in products of LG Electronics, HTC and Motorola Mobility. As new production lines come on stream in 2013 and Samsung finds new mobile chip customers, competition will heat up against Intel and Taiwan’s TSMC, which makes chips under contract for fab-less players such as Qualcomm and TI. But Samsung’s Achilles heel is that it competes in some product areas such as mobile phones with its potential chip foundry clients, which could make some firms uncomfortable in handing over their technology to a rival. A recent dispute with Apple over mobile patents, while at the same time supplying chips to its U.S. competitor, shows the sensitivity and complexity of such arrangements, sparking speculation that Apple may switch to TSMC, or even Intel, for some of its chips. Indeed, Apple increased purchase of mobile DRAM chips from Japan’s Elpida late last year seeking to lessen its reliance on Samsung, which makes mobile processors, DRAM, NAND-flash chips and display screens for iPhones and iPads. A shuffle among Samsung’s managers, with components chief Kwon Oh-hyun moving to CEO, is seen as addressing some of those concerns. “Samsung is trying to alleviate component customers’ concerns by putting the component side of the company back in the seat of power,” said Mark Newman, a Bernstein analyst.

ST-Ericsson, which focuses on mobile and wireless chips, announced the sale on Tuesday without naming the buyer. An Intel spokesman later said the U.S. chipmaker bought the assets. Neither company revealed the price, but ST-Ericsson said the proceeds from the sale, combined with the avoidance of employee restructuring charges and other related restructuring costs, would reduce the joint venture’s cash needs by approximately $90 million. STMicro and Ericsson announced in March they were winding down ST-Ericsson, which has been hit by a big drop in orders from top customer Nokia and has struggled to compete with other chipmakers. ST-Ericsson’s GPS-related intellectual property rights and engineers add to Intel’s already existing GPS assets, Intel spokesman Chris Kraeuter said."

ASML cut a similar deal with Intel Corp. in July and said then that it expected to reach agreements with TSMC and Samsung Electronics to accelerate the development of its “extreme ultraviolet” or EUV lithography technology and 450-millimeter lithography tools. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon, but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. When ASML announced its first customer deal with Intel on July 9th, Intel said it hoped the R&D investment boost would help speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. At the time, some analysts said paying $50 for a tablet computer is not beyond the realm of possibility. “One of the biggest challenges facing IC scaling today is how to effectively control the escalating wafer manufacturing cost,” said Shang-yi Chiang, TSMC executive vice president and co-chief operating officer, who added that is he confident the program with ASML will speed up the development of new technologies. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and EUV lithography. “The objective of the Co-Investment program is to secure and accelerate key lithography technologies.

No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacenters in the cloud to serve billions of users. Ericsson’s partnership with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacenters, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM.  The Swedish company’s plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said. Telecom operators are rushing to build datacenters in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. “The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,” Vestberg said. “This is predominately to see that we give a competitive edge for our customers, the carriers.” The move builds on a number of smaller cloud software company acquisitions made by Ericsson over the past year.

In a reversal of the morning’s premarket action, BofA fell while Intel Corp rallied. It had been pressured a day after it cut its outlook, though it also reported a better-than-expected profit. Financial shares were the weakest of the day, dropping 0.5 percent. Bank of America Corp lost 1.4 percent to $7.81 after swinging to a second-quarter profit that followed a massive mortgage-related charge a year earlier. It also posted a decline in revenue. With the share decline, BofA breaks a streak of post-result rallies by such financials as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs. Intel late Tuesday cut its full-year revenue outlook, the latest tech name to warn on demand, but the shares rebounded 2.5 percent to $26 in early trading and lifted technology shares 1 percent. “We’re relatively stable today with a relief rally in Intel since people were worried the results would be much worse than what was delivered, though there are still some questions about financials, especially ones with a lot of derivative exposure like Bank of America,” said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar & Co in New York.

2013-01-18,-6,"* Morgan Stanley up more than 5 pct after results * U.S. Republicans weigh short-term debt limit increase * Indexes down: Dow 0.1 pct; S&P 0.2 pct; Nasdaq 0.4 pct By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Friday from a five-year high for the S&P 500 as a weak outlook from tech heavyweight Intel offset a better-than-expected quarterly profit at Morgan Stanley. But the S&P 500 was still on track to end higher for a third consecutive week. Shares of Intel Corp slumped nearly 7 percent to $21.11 a day after it forecast quarterly revenue below analysts’ estimates and announced plans for increased capital spending amid slow demand for personal computers. “Intel earnings weren’t that bad, although their revenue was weak. It sparks fears about not only the company but about the whole PC sector, and that’s pressuring the market today,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The Intel results were offset somewhat by Morgan Stanley , which reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock jumped 7.4 percent to $22.29. Overall, S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings rose an estimated  2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Expectations for the quarter have dropped considerably since October, when a 9.9 percent gain was estimated. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.17 points, or 0.11 percent, at 13,580.85. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 3.51 points, or 0.24 percent, at 1,477.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 13.98 points, or 0.45 percent, at 3,122.03. On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest since late 2007, and that could prompt investors to lock in recent gains, analysts said. Despite the day’s decline, market sentiment was still positive on speculation that chances were better of avoiding a debt ceiling fight in Washington. House Republicans signaled on Thursday they might support a short-term extension of U.S. borrowing authority next month. “The debt ceiling issue is sort of out of the news. The market has definitely become complacent. And we all know that the issue will be dealt with, we just need to find out when. If December is any guide, they are going to leave it up to the last minute so the market is definitely more complacent than it should be for now,” Ghriskey said. Reflecting the complacency, the CBOE Volatility index , Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, fell 4.1 percent at just above 13. The VIX usually moves inversely to the S&P 500 as it is used as a hedge tool against further market decline. Economic data from China provided some support to the market, though the focus remained on U.S. corporate earnings. The country’s economy grew at a modestly faster-than-expected 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the latest sign the world’s second-biggest economy was pulling out of a post-global financial crisis slowdown which saw it grow in 2012 at its weakest pace since 1999. General Electric reported a better-than-expected rise in earnings, spurred by robust demand in China and oil-producing countries. Shares were up 2.9 percent to $21.92. Despite the gains by Morgan Stanley, financial stocks sagged as Capital One Financial reported disappointing profit. Capital One slumped 7.7 percent to $56.87, while the KBW bank index slipped 0.9 percent. Research In Motion  climbed 6.6 percent to $15.91 after Jefferies Group boosted the BlackBerry maker’s rating and price target."
2014-05-30,1,"While other companies have been talking up their plans to deliver such a service, a source familiar with the matter said that Verizon was now moving away from the OTT strategy and that the departure of Huggers, who was a proponent of an Internet-only service, reflected that. A Verizon spokesman confirmed Huggers’ departure and in regards to its strategy said, “We obtained a strong combination of technological and personnel assets from Intel Media. We intend to strategically utilize the OnCue technology and talent going forward to grow our business. That has not changed.” Verizon had previously said OnCue would help it offer video over its Fios fiber-optic infrastructure as well.  Seen by some as a bold attempt to revolutionize TV and others as a distraction from Intel’s chip business, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pulled the plug and put the unit up for sale before it was launched.  Intel’s retreat from streaming TV was a disappointment to people in Silicon Valley who hoped the technology company could break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable and entertainment conglomerates. With the acquisition, Huggers and many of his employees moved over to Verizon, where he hoped to launch the service to consumers. But he told Reuters he advised his staff on Thursday that he was leaving the company. Huggers said in an interview he had worked well with his immediate boss at Verizon, Marni Walden, recently appointed to head product development, as well as Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam.  ”There were no conflicts at all. The technology is great, the team is great, the future is secure, the dream lives on. It’s time to hand the baby over to someone else,” he said. Verizon’s rivals are working on their own Internet TV services. AT&T Inc (T.N), which made an offer to buy DirecTV last week in a $45.5 billion deal, has said it would take 12 to 18 months for the combined companies to come up with an over-the-top service.  Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). "

2015-03-12,-11,"* Weekly jobless claims fall, retail sales disappoint * Intel shares fall after lowered outlook * Indexes up: Dow 0.9 pct, S&P 0.7 pct, Nasdaq 0.3 pct   (Updates to market open, adds Intel outlook) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose modestly on Thursday, partially rebounding after a recent bout of weakness, though a surprise drop in retail sales and a weak outlook from Intel limited the day’s gains. Wall Street has been on a downtrend of late, with the S&P 500 down in eight of the past 11 sessions, shedding 3 percent over the past four sessions alone. The weakness has largely been driven by concerns the Fed could raise rates as early as June. Last week’s strong payroll report solidified this view, as the central bank said it would begin raising rates when it deemed the economy strong enough to handle it. In the latest data, jobless claims fell far more than expected in the latest week, supporting a theory that the labor market is rapidly strengthening. Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February. “I’ve been a believer in a June rate hike for a while, but the odds really went up on Friday, and the market action we’ve seen since then is in line with the volatility we’ve historically seen around rate hikes,” said James Liu, global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. Intel Corp slashed its revenue forecast for the first quarter, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain. Shares of the Dow component fell 3 percent to $31.35 and limited the Nasdaq’s advance. The U.S. dollar index fell 0.8 percent but remains up about 10 percent for the year, building on last year’s rise of nearly 13 percent. “The dollar has been strengthening dramatically, which investors are correctly interpreting as implying weak earnings growth over coming quarters,” Liu said. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 2.7 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. Lumber Liquidators rose 3.6 percent to $33.94 in volatile trading. The company, facing U.S. government investigations over claims of dangerous levels of a cancer-causing substance in its flooring products, stood by the safety its products and offered free indoor air-quality testing for qualifying consumers. JA Solar rose 6.5 percent to $9.60 after results. Shake Shack tumbled 9 percent to $42.60 after it forecast slowing same-restaurant sales growth in 2015. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 161.04 points, or 0.91 percent, to 17,796.43, the S&P 500 gained 14.4 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,054.64 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.82 points, or 0.28 percent, to 4,863.76. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,366 to 393, for a 6.02-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,693 issues rose and 579 fell for a 2.92-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

2013-06-19,9,"Incoming chief executive Simon Segars said the British company’s power efficient technology was deeply embedded in smartphones and tablets because it was licensed so widely, saving chipmakers development costs and ensuring compatibility. ARM licenses its technology to partners like Qualcomm , Nvidia, Broadcom and MediaTek <2454,TW>, which use the blueprints to make their own chips. ARM-based chips are used in nearly all smartphones and tablets, but the company faces growing competition from Intel, which was slow to react to the mobile revolution but is showing signs of becoming competitive. Last month the U.S chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its Atom mobile processors to date. Intel’s stock has risen about 5 percent since it gave an overview of the new technology, while ARM’s shares have fallen around 19 percent. The U.S chipmaker also scored a major victory earlier this month when Samsung said it would use an Intel mobile chip to power its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch tablet. Segars said ARM had always expected Intel to gain some design wins, but he said the British company would retain the largest share of the mobile market. “We have always considered (Intel) to be a formidable company,” he said at the Reuters Global Technology Summit in San Francisco. But he said ARM was developing products that delivered the right performance at the lowest possible power consumption by focusing on the whole system, including how data moved around the chip and how the processor and graphics interacted. “We think that what we are doing in terms of that roadmap - the execution, the way we work with our partners - keeps our technology ahead,” he said on Wednesday. ARM unveiled its newest line of processors, the Cortex A-12, earlier this month, aimed at the fast growing $200-$350 smartphone segment, which the company says will number half a billion devices by 2015. It also launched a partner line in its Mali graphics processors and it first video processing technology, and the designs to join them all together. Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told the Reuters Global Technology Summit on Tuesday that his company would license its technology to other chipmakers to take greater advantage of the booming market for mobile computing. Segars said that, like in main processors, the strength of its graphic solution lay in its compatibility with the rest of the ARM ecosystem. “We think we have a pretty solid line of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units),” he said. “It’s about doing a great job of implementation, technical synergy with the rest of the key building blocks in the processor, and I think us doing all of that together means we can hopefully deliver a great solution to our customers.” Segars, who is currently based in California, has worked at ARM for 22 years. He takes over from Warren East on July 1. It is the first change at the top since 2001, but Segars said he was not planning any big overhauls. He said the collegiate atmosphere of the company, which reflects its base in the university city of Cambridge in east England, was a strength he wanted to retain. “For me, the priority is keep doing what we are doing because we do it well and make sure we capitalise on the new opportunities that we see,” he said.

2012-08-15,-20,"* Nintendo making no known effort, says Enough Project * HTC, Sharp, Canon, Nikon lack progress in fight - report UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Intel, Motorola Solutions, Hewlett Packard  and Apple  are pioneering progress toward wiping out the use of conflict minerals - like tantalum, tin and tungsten - in their products, but other companies are lagging, according to a report by a nonprofit rights group. The Enough Project - an arm of the Center for American Progress that combats crimes against humanity - placed Nintendo   at the bottom of its conflict minerals ranking and also singled out HTC, Sharp, Nikon  and Canon for a lack of progress. “Nintendo has made no known effort to trace or audit its supply chain,” the “Taking conflict out of consumer gadgets” report said. “Sharp, HTC, Nikon and Canon are taking initial steps to join industry efforts, but their progress remains far behind industry leaders.” Nikon declined to comment on the report. Sharp, HTC, Canon and Nintendo were not immediately available for comment. The Enough Project scored companies on efforts to trace the source of the minerals and metals used, whether detailed audits of supply chains were being carried out, and if steps are being taken to develop an international conflict-free certification. Other criteria included environmental rankings and whether support had been expressed for legislation on conflict minerals. Intel, Motorola Solutions, HP and Apple “have moved forward to develop solutions despite delays in the legislative rule-making process by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC - an excuse that many other companies have used to explain their lack of significant action,” the report said. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires companies to disclose whether they use tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is due to vote on Aug. 22 on long-delayed guidelines needed to enforce the conflict minerals law. Intel, Motorola Solutions, HP and Apple have taken steps including developing a smelter auditing program and an aid project for lagging smelters and aid projects to help develop a clean minerals trade, the report said. The Enough Project said SanDisk, Philips, Sony, Panasonic, RIM and AMD  have significantly improved their efforts “by surveying their suppliers, piloting due diligence, and joining the smelter audit program.” The U.S. conflict minerals rule has been arguably one of the most controversial rules in the Dodd-Frank law. Companies would need to identify if any conflict minerals are used in their products. If the minerals are present, the companies would then need to conduct a due diligence check to track them through the supply chain to their origins. War-torn DRC sits on large reserves of minerals used in electronics production and the Enough Project has warned that months of unrest in Congo’s volatile east is hampering progress made in curbing the conflict minerals trade. Tutsi-led M23 rebels are fighting government forces in the resource-rich eastern Congo and U.N. experts and Kinshasa have accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the uprising. Both countries have rejected the allegations. The Enough Project has said the armed groups in eastern Congo were still generating income by smuggling tantalum, tin and tungsten through Rwanda."

Shares of Intel Corp lost 4.7 percent to $25.29 to weigh on each of the three major U.S. indexes after fourth quarter earnings missed expectations by a penny due to weak spending on servers. The chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. General Electric Co lost 2.8 percent to $26.44. The conglomerate posted a slightly better-than-expected rise in revenue on Friday propelled by its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines. But American Express Co was a bright spot, climbing 4.9 percent to $92.06. The credit card company gave the biggest boost to the Dow and S&P 500 after reporting strong quarterly results after the close on Thursday. “The market is frustrated at the moment, there is no reason to push higher,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O‘Neil Securities in New York. “There are mixed earnings and even the ones that are coming in stronger, people are taking advantage and using those as sources of cash, so they are taking some money off the table, which is just holding us here.” Morgan Stanley rose 3.9 percent to $33.26. The Wall Street bank reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills but adjusted earnings beat estimates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.12 points or 0.17 percent, to 16,445.13, the S&P 500 lost 2.57 points or 0.14 percent, to 1,843.32 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 8.311 points or 0.2 percent, to 4,210.377. After surging 30 percent in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the S&P 500 started the year on a weak note but recovered recently to set a new record high Wednesday. It is now roughly flat for the year. Housing starts fell less than expected in December, as data showed a 9.8 percent drop, the largest percentage decline since April, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of a 999,000-unit pace.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment came in at 80.4, down from 82.5 in December, weighed by lowered expectations among lower- and middle-income families. But industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. The Dow Jones Transportation Average lost 0.5 percent, dragged down by a 1.5 percent decline in United Parcel Service Inc to $99.06 and a 2.5 percent fall in Con-Way Inc to $40.36 after fourth-quarter outlooks.

Ericsson, the world’s leading maker of mobile network equipment, said it will help its global base of major telecoms companies to shift to cloud computing using Intel datacentre designs to compete more actively with Web rivals. No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacentres in the cloud to serve billions of users. Ericsson’s partnership with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacentres, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM. The Swedish company’s plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said. Telecom operators are rushing to build datacentres in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. “The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,” Vestberg said. “This is predominately to see that we give a competitive edge for our customers, the carriers.” The move builds on a number of smaller cloud software company acquisitions made by Ericsson over the past year.

2014-07-08,0,"Manufacturers are rolling out growing numbers of Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other. The new consortium, which also includes chipmakers Broadcom and Atmel, was announced in a news release late on Monday.  Doug Fisher, general manager of Intel’s Software and Services Group, told Reuters that the framework to be developed by the new consortium would address security and other issues not adequately handled by the AllSeen group. The potential emergence of smart household products made by manufacturers using two sets of incompatible standards would be incidental, he said. “We’re not out to create that. We just think the industry has spoken and there’s this approach that’s needed,” Fisher said. “We’re certainly welcoming others to participate.”  Last week, Microsoft became the 51st member of the AllSeen Alliance, which also includes Sharp Corp and other consumer electronics manufacturers. Rob Chandhok, senior vice president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc, compared the two competing standards groups to walled-off online services in the early 1990s before widespread Internet use. “It’s better for us to have an industry-wide shared platform than to be divided,” Chandhok said. “I don’t want to get to a ‘Prodigy and CompuServe’ of the Internet of Things.” Technology heavyweights Apple and Google are also pursuing their own ways of interconnecting household devices. Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies’ products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which will integrate control of devices like lights and thermostats.

A profit warning by UnitedHealth led to a 5.65 percent drop in its stock, making the health insurer the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500. It also sent the shares of competitors Anthem and Aetna  down more than 6 percent each. The S&P healthcare sector was the worst performer among the 10 major S&P sectors with a 1.63 percent decline. Adding to the pain in healthcare, Pfizer fell 3.06 percent after reports that its talks to buy Allergan and redomicile in Ireland were in final stages. Allergan lost 2.81 percent. Intel Corp jumped 3.44 percent after boosting its annual dividend. The chipmaker and Apple, up 1.27 percent, added more upward pressure to the S&P 500 than any other stocks. Mobile payments company Square soared 45 percent in its highly-anticipated market debut, while dating website operator Match Group popped 23 percent on their first trading day. Data on Thursday appeared to support the Federal Reserve’s view of a strengthening labor market ahead of its meeting next month. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week. Minutes from the Fed’s October meeting, released on Wednesday, hardened expectations of a December interest rate hike and hinted at a cautious approach after that. Investors are increasingly pondering the pace of more rate increases in 2016, said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. “We think the Fed will raise rates in December, but it will be more important how they set expectations about subsequent rate increases,” Carter said. “If the Fed sets an expectation that subsequent rate increases will be modest and measured, we think the equity markets can rally for some time.” The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.02 percent weaker at 17,732.75 points while the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent to 2,081.24. The Nasdaq Composite edged 0.03  percent lower to 5,073.64. Seven of the 10 S&P sectors ended higher, led by utilities , up 0.99 percent. After the bell, Gap Inc posted quarterly results that sent its shares down 4 percent.

2014-06-13,-5,"* Intel up on outlook, OpenTable soars on Priceline deal * Iraq unrest drives up oil prices * Indexes up: Dow 0.3 pct, S&P 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.3 pct   (Updates to close) By Angela Moon NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Friday, boosted by bullish news from the tech sector, but major indexes fell for the week as unrest in Iraq kept investors on edge. Intel Corp was one of the S&P 500’s biggest gainers and one of Nasdaq’s most active names, but overall gains were capped as investors kept a close watch on violence in Iraq that drove oil prices to their highest since September. Analysts are worried about the impact a protracted period of high commodity prices could have on economic growth, especially with indexes near record levels. President Barack Obama said on Friday he needs several days to determine how the United States will help Iraq deal with a militant insurgency, but he ruled out sending U.S. troops back into combat and said any intervention would be contingent on Iraqi leaders becoming more involved. “The situation in Iraq is another one of these geopolitical flare-ups that have a short-term impact on the market. It will continue to create volatility in the oil market, but I don’t think it will spill over that much to equities,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. The CBOE Volatility index VIX, Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, fell 3 percent to 12.18 on Friday. Intel shares jumped nearly 7 percent to $29.87 a day after the Dow component raised its full-year revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers used by businesses. OpenTable Inc popped 48.3 percent to $104.48 in heavy trading after Priceline Group Inc said it would buy the company for $2.6 billion. Priceline fell 3 percent to $1,189.30. Among other Internet names, Yelp Inc jumped 13.8 percent to $74.92 and GrubHub Inc rose 7 percent to $36.00. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.55 points or 0.25 percent, to 16,775.74, the S&P 500 gained 6.05 points or 0.31 percent, to 1,936.16, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.02 points or 0.3 percent, to 4,310.65. For the week, the Dow was down 0.9 percent, the S&P fell 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.25 percent. The week’s decline was the first after three weeks of consecutive gains on the S&P 500. For the year, the broad market index is up about 4.8 percent. Brent crude edged further above $113 a barrel on Friday, up about $4 since the start of the week, on concerns that an insurgency in Iraq could trigger civil war and eventually hit oil exports. In macroeconomic news, U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in June as views by consumers with the lowest incomes soured, according to the preliminary June read from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s index. Finisar Corp plunged 21.9 percent to $19.71 a day after forecasting weaker-than-expected earnings, citing higher capital expenditure in China.

2015-03-12,-11,"* Bank stocks higher after Fed stress tests * Weekly jobless claims fall; retail sales disappoint * Intel shares fall after lowered outlook * Indexes up: Dow 0.9 pct, S&P 0.8 pct, Nasdaq 0.4 pct   (Updates to mid-morning trading) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, with banking stocks among the biggest gainers of the day, though tech shares were pressured by a weak outlook from Intel. All 10 primary S&P 500 sectors were higher on the day, representing a partial rebound off a recent bout of weakness, which took the S&P 500 down in eight of the past 11 sessions, and off 3 percent over the past four sessions alone. The weakness has largely been driven by concerns the Fed could raise rates as early as June. Last week’s strong payroll report solidified this view as the central bank said it would begin raising rates when it deemed the economy strong enough. In the latest data, jobless claims fell far more than expected in the latest week, supporting the theory that the labor market is rapidly strengthening. Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February. “I’ve been a believer in a June rate hike for a while, but the odds really went up on Friday, and the market action we’ve seen since then is in line with the volatility we’ve historically seen around rate hikes,” said James Liu, global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. The S&P financial sector rose 1.3 percent as one of the biggest gainers on the day in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s annual check-up on the industry’s health. Citigroup passed, allowing it to raise payouts and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.05. Bank of America  was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares fell 0.7 percent to $16. Intel Corp slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.  Shares of the Dow component fell 4 percent to $31.03 and also limited the Nasdaq’s advance. The U.S. dollar index fell 0.6 percent but remains up about 10 percent for the year, building on last year’s rise of nearly 13 percent. “The dollar has been strengthening dramatically, which investors are correctly interpreting as implying weak earnings growth over coming quarters,” Liu said. First-quarter S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 2.7 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. Lumber Liquidators rose 12 percent to $36.79 in volatile trading. The company, facing U.S. government investigations over claims of dangerous levels of a cancer-causing substance in its flooring products, stood by the safety its products and offered free indoor air-quality testing for qualifying consumers.

Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE 2,204 to 679, for a 3.25-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,692 issues rose and 843 fell, a 2.01-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 was posting 13 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 87 new highs and 50 new lows. "
2012-07-18,-13,"* BofA shares rise after swinging to Q2 profit * Vivus soars in premarket, FDA approves obesity drug * Futures down: Dow 37 pts, S&P 4.3 pts, Nasdaq 6.75 pts By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Wednesday as Intel joined the ranks of tech companies to cut their outlooks in a sign of how tepid economic conditions worldwide are hurting revenue. Financials will also be in focus following results from Bank of America Corp, which swung to a second-quarter profit following a massive mortgage-related charge a year earlier. The Dow component rose 1.6 percent to $8.05 in premarket trading, following similar rallies by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs. Intel Corp late Tuesday cut its full-year revenue outlook and said consumer spending in Europe and the United States was softer than previously thought. “We’re clearly seeing softness in company revenue because of Europe and the global slowdown, and that’s a concern,” said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York. “We’re seeing those fears spread across industries, but Bank of America is another example of financials being surprisingly strong. That could be a sector that shines because expectations are so low.” Among tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices and Applied Materials also cut their guidance in recent weeks, contributing to month-to-date losses of more than 2 percent in the S&P information technology index. The group is considered a proxy for business spending, and the weak views in the sector could have broader implications. S&P 500 futures fell 4.3 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 37 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 6.75 points. Still, earnings reports at large continue to be solid. With 7 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 65 percent have beaten profit expectations, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. Only 15 percent have missed. A number of key reports will be released on Wednesday, including those of American Express Co and International Business Machines Corp. Bank of New York Mellon  and PNC Financial reported earlier on Wednesday. Investors will also be looking to Ben Bernanke, the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, who will deliver the semi-annual “Monetary Policy Report to the Congress” before the House Financial Services Committee. Bernanke testified before a Senate committee on Tuesday, and while he didn’t give any specifics over what the central bank might do to accelerate growth amid signs of weakness, he left the door open to more stimulus if it became clear unemployment was not falling or if deflation risks mounted. In company news, Vivus Inc surged 18 percent to $31.25 in premarket trading after the Food and Drug Administration approved the company’s obesity drug. June housing starts will be released at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) and are seen edging higher from the previous month. Wall Street rose on Tuesday, lifted by strong results from Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola Co. Still, the S&P has posted losses in seven of the last nine sessions, falling about 1 percent."
2013-01-18,-8,"* Weak outlook weighs on Intel * Futures: S&P up 0.2 pt, Dow down 3 pts, Nasdaq down 8 pts By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Friday, a day after the S&P 500 rose to its highest level in five years, as a weak outlook from Intel was weighed against encouraging data out of China and a fourth-quarter profit at Morgan Stanley. Shares of Intel Corp slumped 5.4 percent to $21.44 in premarket trading after the tech company forecast quarterly revenue that was below analysts’ estimates and hiked capital spending plans for the year. Futures got a lift after Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock was up 7.2 percent at $22.25 in premarket trading. Economic data out of China provided some support to the market. The country’s economy grew at a modestly faster-than-expected 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the latest sign the world’s second-biggest economy was pulling out of a post-global financial crisis slowdown which saw it grow in 2012 at its weakest pace since 1999. S&P 500 futures rose 0.2 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures slipped 3 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 8 points. Stronger-than-expected economic data boosted the S&P 500 on Thursday to its highest level in five years. The index is now just 5.6 percent from a record closing peak of 1,565.15. It would be a normal reaction for investors to take a pause at this point, but any weakness in the market could be a buying opportunity, said Andre Bakhos, director of market analytics at Lek Securities in New York. “It’s the type of market where it’s starting to gain momentum and if investors miss the run, they’re going to be behind the eight ball early in the year,” said Bakhos. General Electric reported a rise in earnings on Friday, pushing its shares up 3.5 percent in premarket trading to $22.05. Johnson Controls dropped 2.6 percent to $31.12 after its profit fell and the company forecast further declines. Overall, S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have risen 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed. Expectations for the quarter have dropped considerably since October, when a 9.9 percent gain was estimated. AT&T warned after Thursday’s closing bell that it will take a fourth-quarter charge of about $10 billion due to bigger-than-expected pension obligations. Shares of the telephone company fell 1.4 percent to $32.74 in premarket trading Friday. On the economic front, a report on consumer sentiment in early January will be released at 9:55 am ET (1455 GMT)."

Still, the S&P 500 was on track for a third week in a row of gains and remained near a five-year high. Shares of Intel Corp slumped 6.7 percent to $21.17 a day after it forecast quarterly revenue below analysts’ estimates and announced plans for increased capital spending amid slow demand for personal computers. On a positive note, Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock jumped 7.5 percent to $22.32. “Intel earnings weren’t that bad, although their revenue was weak. It sparks fears about not only the company but about the whole PC sector, and that’s pressuring the market today,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Heading into a three-day weekend, investors were cautious about the chances for settling of major differences in Congress about government debt and spending. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday “Governmental policy, or lack thereof, is again pushing forth this wait-and-see attitude on the part of investors. So the market is flat and with low volume and low volatilty because investors are waiting to see what happens with the debt ceiling and spending cuts,” said Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois. There were signs that the question of raising the U.S. debt limit would be put off for a while. House Republican leaders said they would seek to pass a three-month extension of federal borrowing authority next week to buy time for the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass a budget that shrinks deficits. Overall, S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings rose an estimated  2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 8.69 points, or 0.06 percent, at 13,604.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 0.17 points, or 0.01 percent, at 1,481.11. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 8.61 points, or 0.27 percent, at 3,127.39. On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest since late 2007, and that could prompt investors to lock in recent gains, analysts said. Reflecting the complacency, the CBOE Volatility index , Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, fell 7.4 percent. The VIX usually moves inversely to the S&P 500 as it is used as a hedge tool against further market decline. Economic data from China provided some support to the market, though the focus remained on U.S. corporate earnings. The country’s economy grew at a modestly faster-than-expected 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the latest sign the world’s second-biggest economy was pulling out of a post-global financial crisis slowdown which saw it grow in 2012 at its weakest pace since 1999. General Electric reported a better-than-expected rise in earnings, spurred by robust demand in China and oil-producing countries. Shares were up 3.2 percent at $21.99. Despite the gains by Morgan Stanley, financial stocks sagged as Capital One Financial reported disappointing profit.

The Intel results were offset somewhat by a gain of more than 7 percent in shares of Morgan Stanley, which reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock jumped 7.4 percent to $22.29. Overall, S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings rose an estimated  2.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest since late 2007, and that could prompt investors to lock in recent gains, analysts said. But despite the day’s decline, market sentiment was still positive on speculation that chances were better of avoiding a debt ceiling fight in Washington. House Republicans signaled on Thursday they might support a short-term extension of U.S. borrowing authority next month. “The debt ceiling issue is sort of out of the news. The market has definitely become complacent. And we all know that the issue will be dealt with, we just need to find out when. If December is any guide, they are going to leave it up to the last minute so the market is definitely more complacent than it should be for now,” Ghriskey said.

International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp  were the biggest drags on the Dow. IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has been a strong earnings season. The S&P 500 had its best day in a month on Tuesday as Coca-Cola Co  led the day’s round of solid earnings and as concerns eased over the euro zone debt crisis. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, Tennessee, expects the market to continue its back-and-forth, possibly trending lower in the second quarter after strong gains earlier in the year. “A consolidation or correction phase in the second quarter would make the most sense, and probably it would be the most healthy thing for the market,” he said. Market breadth was worse than the relatively slight losses suggested in the late morning. On the New York Stock Exchange, two stocks declined for every one that rose. Chesapeake Energy Corp slumped nearly 9 percent to $17.40 after Reuters reported that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of company oil and natural gas wells. Chesapeake was the most actively traded stock on the NYSE, outstripping even Bank of America with its massive share float. “I think where there is smoke, there may be fire, and investors are still in a shoot-first mentality,” said David Lutz, a trader a Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.18 points, or 0.54 percent, at 13,044.36. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 6.80 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,383.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index was off 17.60 points, or 0.58 percent, at 3,025.22. IBM lost 2.5 percent to $202.32 and Intel fell 1.7 percent to $27.98. The PHLX semiconductor index declined 1.2 percent. According to Thomson Reuters data, 22 companies in the S&P 500 were expected to report on Wednesday, including American Express Co, Qualcomm Inc and eBay Inc  after the close. Of the 56 S&P 500 companies reporting through Wednesday morning, 79 percent beat Wall Street estimates. “Investors should not overreact to positive news nor should they be overreacting to really what could be viewed as isolated earnings reports. One report does not make a trend, unfortunately,” said Tim Speiss, a partner at Eisner Amper in New York. Yahoo Inc gained 3.1 percent to $15.47 after quarterly revenues rose in the first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company. Halliburton Co advanced 4.2 percent to $34.02 after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company said North American revenue reached a record high. The PHLX oil service sector  gained 1.1 percent. SXC Health Solutions Corp  will buy pharmacy benefit manager Catalyst Health Solutions Inc for about $4.4 billion. Catalyst jumped 31.2 percent to $83.43 and U.S.-listed shares of SXC Health climbed 8 percent to $86.74. Genworth Financial Inc slid 22 percent to $6 and was the worst S&P 500 performer after the life and mortgage insurer pushed back the initial public offering of an Australian unit. Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett said he has stage 1 prostate cancer that “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” Berkshire Class B shares lost 1.2 percent to $79.78."

IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. IBM shares slipped 3.5 percent to $200.13 while Intel shares fell 1.8 percent to $27.95. The PHLX semiconductor index .SOX dropped 0.9 percent. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has so far been a strong earnings season. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 had its best day in a month as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) led the day’s round of solid earnings and concerns eased over the euro zone’s debt crisis. Tuesday’s rally also gave both the Dow and the Nasdaq their biggest one-day percentage gains since March 13. “Both Intel and IBM have led to some profit-taking today, with both companies posting decent reports, but disappointing investors for different reasons,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “If you want to be an optimist, you could point to the fact that the market didn’t sell off all that much, given the solid advance we saw yesterday.” The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 82.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 13,032.75. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX shed 5.64 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,385.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC slipped 11.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 3,031.45. After the closing bell, shares of Qualcomm (QCOM.O) fell 3.3 percent to $64.77 as the chipmaker provided a disappointing quarterly and full-year outlook. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist of Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, Tennessee, expects the market to continue its back-and-forth moves, possibly trending lower in the second quarter after strong gains earlier in the year. “A consolidation or correction phase in the second quarter would make the most sense, and probably it would be the most healthy thing for the market,” he said. A bright spot in the tech space, Yahoo Inc YHOO.O shares gained 3.2 percent to $15.49, a day after reporting that quarterly revenues rose - marking Yahoo’s first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company. Eighty percent of S&P 500 companies are beating earnings estimates so far, with results in from 66 companies. Other advancers included Halliburton Co (HAL.N), up 4.6 percent at $34.17, after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company said North American revenue reached a record high. In contrast, shares of Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) slid 23.8 percent to $5.87 after the life and mortgage insurer pushed back the initial public offering of an Australian unit. Volume was lighter than average, with about 5.95 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below this year’s daily average of 6.67 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 2 to 1, and on the Nasdaq, by about 17 to 7. "
2012-04-19,-30,"* Collusion said to limit worker pay, mobility * Judge: Plausible that violations known at “highest levels” * DOJ settled probes in 2010 By Jonathan Stempel April 19 (Reuters) - Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp and four other technology companies were ordered by a judge to face an antitrust lawsuit claiming they illegally conspired not to poach each other’s employees. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, rejected the companies’ bid to dismiss claims brought under the federal Sherman antitrust law and California’s own antitrust law, the Cartwright Act. In a decision on Wednesday night, Koh said the existence of “Do Not Cold Call” agreements among various defendants “supports the plausible inference that the agreements were negotiated, reached, and policed at the highest levels” of the companies. “The fact that all six identical bilateral agreements were reached in secrecy among seven defendants in a span of two years suggests that these agreements resulted from collusion, and not from coincidence,” Koh added. Other defendants in the case included Adobe Systems Inc , Intuit Inc, Walt Disney Co’s Pixar unit and Lucasfilm Ltd. Koh dismissed a claim brought under California’s unfair competition law. Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment. The proposed class-action lawsuit was brought by five software engineers who accused the companies of conspiring to limit pay and job mobility by eliminating competition for labor, costing workers hundreds of millions of dollars. Their claims are similar to those raised in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Justice when it settled antitrust probes against the companies. Without admitting wrongdoing, the companies agreed not to take steps to restrict competition for workers, including setting limits on cold-calling and recruiting. Among the revelations stemming from the litigation was a 2007 email trail involving the late Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt, then respectively Apple’s and Google’s chief executives, over Google’s apparent effort to recruit an Apple engineer. “I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this,” Jobs wrote Schmidt, an Apple director at the time. Schmidt forwarded that email to various people, asking if they could “get this stopped.” Eventually, Google’s staffing director said the employee who recruited the engineer would be fired, and added: “Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs.” Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the five plaintiff engineers, said their case remains on track for a June 2013 trial. “This is a significant step forward,” Saveri said in an email. All of the defendants are based in California: Adobe in San Jose; Apple in Cupertino; Google and Intuit in Mountain View; Intel in Santa Clara; Lucasfilm in San Francisco; and Pixar in Emeryville. Walt Disney is based in Burbank. The case is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-02509."
2012-09-24,-22,"NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - A former Intel Corp  executive, whose trial testimony helped convict hedge fund titan Raj Rajaratnam, avoided prison time on Monday for his role in the biggest insider-trading prosecution of a generation. Rajiv Goel is the third former friend and business associate, who testified against Rajaratnam at his 2011 Manhattan federal court trial, to be handed a sentence of probation. Goel is among scores of fund managers, traders, lawyers, executives and consultants caught in a U.S. government crackdown on Wall Street insider trading in the past four years. In sentencing Goel, 54, to two years probation, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones said his cooperation with the government “did go beyond” ordinary assistance, which his lawyers and prosecutors described in their pre-sentencing briefs. Jones fined Goel $10,000 and ordered him to forfeit $266,000. Goel, who has not worked since losing his job as treasury group manager with chipmaker Intel following his October 2009 arrest, pleaded guilty in February 2010 to being part of Rajaratnam’s network of insiders feeding him corporate secrets. The charges of securities fraud and conspiracy carried a maximum prison term of 25 years. Galleon Group hedge fund founder Rajaratnam, who was convicted of 14 charges of securities fraud and conspiracy by a jury, is serving an 11-year prison term. Rajaratnam’s appeal of secretly recorded telephone calls used by the FBI to gather evidence is scheduled to be heard on Oct. 25. Goel told the sentencing judge that in helping Rajaratnam, “I had a serious lapse of judgment and good sense and I deeply apologize ... I hope that I am given another chance to repair the harm that I have caused.” His lawyer, David Zornow, in requesting a non-custodial sentence, described Rajaratnam as a “master manipulator” and a “clever seducer” of his friends. At Rajaratnam’s trial, Goel told the jury that they met at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s. In 2007 and 2008, Goel gave Rajaratnam confidential information about Intel’s business. U.S. prosecutor Reed Brodsky told the judge on Monday that Goel’s cooperation and testimony were essential “in a very significant prosecution for the government.” Brodsky said Goel’s assistance was relevant in six of the 14 charges against Rajaratnam. Two other former associates of Rajaratnam were also sentenced to two years probation following their trial testimony. They were Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant who also met Rajaratnam at Wharton, and former Galleon money manager Adam Smith. The case is: USA v Rajiv Goel in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-90"
2013-01-07,-2,"* Not in investment talks at the moment with Intel * Hon Hai deal excludes smallscreen LCDs By Tim Kelly LAS VEGAS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Sharp Corp is considering new ways to shore up its crumbling finances but is not talking with Intel Corp at the moment about any investment from the U.S. chipmaker, a senior executive from the Japanese company said on Monday. Industry analysts had speculated that Intel and Sharp - which supplies screens to Apple Inc for its latest iPhone - were in investment discussions, but executives said on Monday the pair were not in talks “at this moment.” Sharp is fighting for survival after years of losses. Like other Japanese brands that spearheaded the 1970s electronics boom, it is wilting under stiffening competition and a strong yen. In November, it said it may not be able to survive on its own after full-year net losses to doubled to $5.6 billion. To repay short-term debt and stave off failure, the maker of Aquos televisions snagged a $4.4 billion bailout in October from its banks. But it is now exploring further options. “Our finances have been weakened considerably and we are considering ways to deal with that,” Sharp Vice President Kozo Takahashi told reporters at a roundtable briefing on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Sharp’s shareholder-equity ratio at the end of September was 9.9 percent - half the minimum level generally considered stable by investors. Takahashi described that only as “low.” Takahashi’s comments on Monday indicated that no new agreement was imminent. He did not elaborate on Sharp’s funding options, except to say that any future cash injections might not be limited to just share offers. Unlike local rivals Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp , Sharp faces limited financing alternatives because it had to mortgage nearly all of its Japanese factories and offices to secure last year’s bailout. It has much less scope to sell assets to underpin its finances, making partnerships with other companies likelier. In December, Qualcomm Inc agreed to invest as much as $120 million in Sharp. As part of that agreement, Qualcomm will work with Sharp to develop new, power-saving screens based on Sharp’s IGZO technology. Qualcomm made an initial investment of 4.93 billion yen ($56.20 million) at the end of the year in a private placement of stock, giving the U.S. company a 2.64 percent stake after dilution. The timing and amount of the remaining investment will be conditional on Sharp’s returning to profit in the six months ending March 31. Sharp has also been in talks for months with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, with an eye to making the Taiwanese company a major shareholder. Talks, however, stalled after Hon Hai said it expected a say in management in return. Current discussions with the Taiwanese company do not cover any partnership in small LCD displays, Takahashi said, such as those for cellphones. Hon Hai already owns a third of Sharp’s 10th-generation large-LCD plant in Sakai, in western Japan, dubbed the most advanced display factory in the world. Sharp may sell its TV assembly plant in Mexico to Hon Hai;  talks to sell the Taiwanese company another factory in China have frozen, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in December."

President Barack Obama said on Friday he needs several days to determine how the United States will help Iraq deal with a militant insurgency, but he ruled out sending U.S. troops back into combat and said any intervention would be contingent on Iraqi leaders becoming more involved.  “The situation in Iraq is another one of these geopolitical flare-ups that have a short-term impact on the market. It will continue to create volatility in the oil market, but I don’t think it will spill over that much to equities,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. The CBOE Volatility index VIX .VIX, Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, fell 3 percent to 12.18 on Friday.

Chesapeake Energy Corp lost 7 percent and was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company’s oil and natural gas wells. Trading in the company’s stock outstripped even Bank of America, with its massive share float and was approaching nearly triple the recent daily average by midday. The stock was trading at $17.78. Earlier, the stock touched a session low at $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. Shares of natural gas companies have been hit recently by falling natural gas prices. “I think where there is smoke, there may be fire, and investors are still in a shoot-first mentality,” said David Lutz, a trader a Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore.

Of the 56 S&P 500 companies reporting through Wednesday morning, 79 percent beat Wall Street’s estimates. “Investors should not overreact to positive news nor should they be overreacting to really what could be viewed as isolated earnings reports. One report does not make a trend, unfortunately,” said Tim Speiss, a partner at EisnerAmper in New York. Yahoo Inc gained 2.9 percent to $15.44 a day after reporting that quarterly revenues rose in the first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company.

2012-04-18,-8,"* 22 S&P 500 companies due to report earns Wed * Indexes off: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were lower on Wednesday after the S&P 500 notched its biggest gain in a month, weighed down by IBM and Intel after their quarterly results. The benchmark S&P on Tuesday climbed 1.55 percent, its biggest percentage gain since March 13, as Coca-Cola Co  led a round of solid earnings reports and on easing concerns over the euro zone debt crisis. “Investors don’t like volatility but large run-ups can be equally unsettling too because investors question if that is going to hold,” said Tim Speiss, a partner at Eisner Amper in New York. According to Thomson Reuters data, 22 companies in the S&P 500 were expected to report on Wednesday, including American Express Co, Qualcomm Inc and eBay Inc  after the close. Of the 56 S&P 500 companies reporting through Wednesday morning, 79 percent beat Wall Street estimates. International Business Machines Corp and Intel were the biggest drags on the Dow after the technology bellwethers posted quarterly results late Tuesday. IBM lost 2.4 percent to $202.56 and Intel fell 2 percent to $27.88. The PHLX semiconductor index declined 1.5 percent. “Investors should not overreact to positive news nor should they be overreacting to really what could be viewed as isolated earnings reports. One report does not make a trend, unfortunately,” said Speiss. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 56.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 13,058.55. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 4.68 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,386.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.36 points, or 0.21 percent, to 3,036.46. Yahoo Inc gained 3.3 percent to $15.51 after posting an uptick in revenue, its first quarterly sales growth in three years, as new the chief executive outlined his plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company. Halliburton Co advanced 4.1 percent to $34 after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company said North American revenue reached a record high. The PHLX oil service sector  gained 1.1 percent. SXC Health Solutions Corp  will buy pharmacy benefit manager Catalyst Health Solutions Inc for about $4.4 billion. Catalyst jumped 30 percent to $82.64 and U.S.-listed shares of SXC Health climbed 6.5 percent to $85.50. Genworth Financial Inc slid 18 percent to $6.32 and was the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the life and mortgage insurer pushed back the initial public offering of an Australian unit. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chief Executive Warren Buffett said he has stage 1 prostate cancer that “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” Berkshire Class B shares lost 1 percent to $80.03."
2014-06-13,-1,"* Intel up on outlook, OpenTable soars on Priceline deal * Oil remains in focus as Iraq violence continues * Indexes up: Dow 0.1 pct, S&P 500 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.3 pct   (Updates to afternoon session) By Angela Moon NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Friday, boosted by bullish news from the tech sector, but major indexes remained on track to snap a multi-week string of gains. Intel Corp was one of the S&P 500’s biggest gainers and one of Nasdaq’s most active name, but overall gains were capped as investors remained cautious about violence in Iraq, which has taken oil prices to their highest since September. Analysts are worried about the impact a protracted period of high commodity prices could have on economic growth, especially with indexes near record levels. President Barack Obama said on Friday he needs several days to determine how the United States will help Iraq deal with a militant insurgency, but he ruled out sending U.S. troops back into combat and said any intervention would be contingent on Iraqi leaders becoming more involved. Intel shares jumped nearly 7 percent to $29.87 a day after the Dow component raised its full-year revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers used by businesses. “The market isn’t cheap, but it isn’t crazy expensive and the sectors that are looking better are cyclical in nature,” said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston. “Tech has been doing well from a price return standpoint, and that should continue.” OpenTable Inc popped 47 percent to $103.52 in heavy trading after Priceline Group Inc said it would buy the company for $2.6 billion. Priceline fell 1.7 percent to $1,205.42. Among other Internet names, Yelp Inc jumped 14 percent to $74.99 and GrubHub Inc rose 8.2 percent to $36.41. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.12 points or 0.14 percent, to 16,758.31, the S&P 500 gained 4.45 points or 0.23 percent, to 1,934.56 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.20 points or 0.31 percent, to 4,310.83. For the week, the Dow is down 1 percent, the S&P is down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq is down 0.2 percent. The CBOE Volatility index VIX, Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, fell 4.6 percent to 11.98 on Friday but was still up more than 10 percent for the week after Thursday’s selloff triggered a spike in the index. We are “intermediate-term bullish, understanding that the overbought conditions can produce sharp but short-lived pullbacks at any time,” said Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in Morristown, New Jersey, in a note to clients. The week’s decline would be the first after three weeks of consecutive gains on the S&P 500. For the year, the broad market index is up nearly 5 percent. Brent crude edged further above $113 a barrel on Friday, up about $4 since the start of the week, on concerns that an insurgency in Iraq could trigger civil war and eventually hit oil exports. In macroeconomic news, U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in June as views by consumers with the lowest incomes soured, according to the preliminary June read from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s index.

2014-01-17,-9,"Earnings season is still in the early phase, but S&P 500 companies so far are beating analysts’ expectations at a rate that’s below what’s typical, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bucking the trend, the Dow ended higher - helped by a rally in American Express Co (AXP.N) and Visa (V.N). AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel’s stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny. General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins. But at least some of the day’s move could have been options related. “January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today’s an example of that,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston. “Money managers typically take their most aggressive picks during the first part of the year, and a lot of options strategies are involved in those picks.” The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 41.55 points or 0.25 percent, to end at 16,458.56. The S&P 500 .SPX fell 7.19 points or 0.39 percent, to finish at 1,838.70. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 21.107 points or 0.50 percent, to 4,197.582. For the week, the Dow rose 0.13 percent, the S&P 500 slipped 0.20 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.55 percent. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Visa shares jumped 4.7 percent to close at $232.18. A U.S. appeals judge appeared to side with the Federal Reserve over a group of retailers in a dispute over the level of fees set by the Fed on the use of debit cards. Among other gainers, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) rose 4.4 percent to $33.40 after previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank (DB.N) fell 3 percent to $52.27 after a Wall Street Journal report that the largest German bank (DBKGn.DE) is considering a profit warning as executives believe its upcoming quarterly results will be below investors’ expectations. <ID:L3N0KR4KZ> The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT slipped 0.4 percent. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) fell 0.6 percent to $99.91 and the stock of Con-Way CNW.N dropped 2 percent to $40.59 after fourth-quarter outlooks. After the S&P 500’s 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday. The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs. Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Volume was above the average for the month. About 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the average of 6.6 billion so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 3 to 2. On the Nasdaq, about 15 stocks fell for every 11 that rose. "
2012-10-24,-5,"The non-profit research consortium, to be known as the Cyber Security Research Alliance (CSRA), will also include Advanced Micro Devices, Honeywell International and EMC Corp’s RSA Security division as founding members. The consortium will coordinate industry research and work closely with government to develop “break-through technologies” to improve cybersecurity, said its president Lee Holcomb, a senior executive at Lockheed’s information systems and global solutions division. Initial prototypes could be developed within a year to 18 months, possibly addressing the security issues raised by the proliferation of so-called embedded devices, such as controllers in cars and the power grid, Holcomb told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We’re going to try to bring together the government, academia and industry to collectively lay out a road map for what are the critical problems and what are the technical solutions and approaches that may work,” he said. “How do we make it real?” U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta last week highlighted the growing threat of cyber attacks, noting that hackers were already going after banks and were developing the ability to strike U.S. power grids and government systems. An August cyber attack on Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, Saudi Aramco, that crippled some 30,000 computers, was probably the most destructive attack ever directed against the private sector, he said. U.S. financial institutions have been under sustained attack in recent weeks by suspected Iranian hackers. Ron Perez, director of security architecture at AMD, said the alliance grew out of an ad hoc group of industry executives that began meeting in late 2009. “What’s new here is the recognition that there are challenges out there that are bigger than any one company, any one university, or consortium of universities, and even bigger than what the government can do on their own,” he said. “To really address these problems, it’s going to take a long-term, well thought-out collaboration process,” Perez said. “And then we need to pick the low-hanging fruit and start delivering on some of those processes.” Holcomb said each of the five founding companies had paid $60,000 in membership dues, but 15 to 20 other companies had expressed interest in joining the non-profit alliance. The group also plans to convene a public symposium early next year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to connect researchers with officials from the private, academic and government sectors."

Oil rose 0.3 percent to $106.88 per barrel but continues to be in focus amid the tense situation in Iraq, where Islamist rebel fighters captured two more towns overnight as they moved toward Baghdad. U.S. President Barack Obama responded by threatening military strikes. “Obama saying he will do whatever is necessary to right the situation is what a lot of people want to see,” said Mullaney, who helps oversee $11.3 billion in assets. “Most people would prefer to see us as the world’s policemen rather than sitting out on the sidelines being isolationist.” U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in June as views by consumers with the lowest incomes soured, according to the preliminary June read from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s index on consumer sentiment.

2012-03-16,-21,"* Allegation emerges in ex-Goldman director Gupta’s case * “Wrong man” on trial, Gupta’s lawyer tells judge By Grant McCool NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - A person at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who has not been identified or charged in a broad U.S. insider-trading probe, was caught on a wiretap leaking secrets about Intel Corp and Apple Inc , a lawyer for former Goldman board member Rajat Gupta said in court on Friday. Lawyer Gary Naftalis, in a heated exchange with U.S. prosecutor Reed Brodsky during a pre-trial hearing, said the Goldman person leaked confidential information about the two companies to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge fund founder convicted of insider-trading charges last year. Gupta, the best-known corporate executive accused in a sweeping prosecution of insider-trading at hedge funds in recent years, denies criminal charges that he tipped Rajaratnam with Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble Co secrets between 2007 and 2009. His trial is scheduled to begin in May. “In a letter he (Brodsky) said the government had a person who provided confidential information to Raj Rajaratnam about Apple and Intel,” Naftalis said. “There is also wiretap evidence, substantial evidence of another source at Goldman Sachs.” Naftalis told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff that the defense believed “there is a much more circumstantial case that person should be sitting in the box rather than us” and “the wrong man is on trial here.” A theme of Gupta’s defense is that the charges brought by U.S. prosecutors last October are circumstantial and that Rajaratnam had a host of sources tipping him with information. A jury convicted Rajaratnam largely on wiretaps, which traditionally have been used in organized crime and narcotics caes, not white-collar investigations. Rajaratnam, once a friend of Gupta‘s, is serving an 11-year prison sentence. Gupta was onetime global head of McKinsey & Co and sat on the boards of several companies. The judge ended the late afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, but Brodsky and Naftalis continued to argue. Brodsky declined to comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Michael DuVally, declined to comment. Goldman has been in the spotlight this week with the public resignation of employee Greg Smith, who said in a New York Times op-ed that Goldman had become “as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it” and was a place he no longer wished to work. A person familiar with the Gupta case said in early March that prosecutors are investigating David Loeb, a managing director of Goldman Sachs. Loeb works with technology hedge-fund employees, including an Asia-based analyst, Henry King, who is also under investigation, according to another source briefed on the case. The sources declined to be identified because the matter is not public. Neither Loeb nor King has been accused of any wrongdoing and neither responded to emails asking for comment. The insider-trading case has drawn in Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who was interviewed under oath on Feb. 24 as a witness, according to court documents. Blankfein testified for the government at Rajaratnam’s trial. He is also expected to be called as a witness by the government at Gupta’s trial. The cases are USA v Gupta in the U.S. District court for the Southern District of New York No. 11-907"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was lifted by Nike’s raised sales forecast and better-than-expected U.S. consumer sentiment data. Investors are also keeping a close watch on the progress of Greece’s negotiations with its creditors. Greece rejected a five-month extension of bailout on Friday. Euro zone finance ministers will meet on Saturday to decide Greece’s fate. “For most part we are trading off any news that comes out of Greece.

2013-11-12,-14,"The stock is up 25 cents to $24.41 on Tuesday afternoon and in the options market, an investor sold 43,700 November $25 strike Intel calls at 3 cents per contract in what is probably a closing trade before expiration, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. In the November $25 calls, volume was 47,644 contracts traded thus far against 67,054 lots in open interest, according to Trade Alert. Separately, but possibly related to the activity in the November $25 strike calls, an investor bought 17,000 December $25 calls on the chipmaker for 28 cents per contract. The December $25 call traded 55,330 times against 80,116 lots in open interest. The January $25, February $24 and December $24 calls on the stock are also seeing interest, as some players are possibly closing out November $25 calls, but seeking to maintain upside exposure by opening positions in later terms, Ruffy said. The stock, which has seen several months of seesaw action, is at the same levels on Tuesday as six months ago, he added. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net  1414 ET 12Nov2013 Bearish action is seen in Facebook options -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Shares in Facebook Inc rose 0.58 percent to $46.47 on Tuesday afternoon. But options activity on the stock this morning suggests some traders are positioning for the price of the underlying shares to continue lower in the near term, said Interactive Brokers Group equity options analyst Caitlin Duffy in a posting on the firm’s website on Tuesday. The stock is down approximately 14 percent since reaching an all-time high of $54.83 on Oct. 18. Big prints in the weekly $45 strike put options, expiring on Nov. 29,  caught Duffy’s attention, as more than 13,700 contracts traded thus far in the strike versus open interest of 4,261 contracts. It appears like most of the puts were purchased near the open at a premium of 94 cents each, she said. Owners of these $45 puts stand ready to profit at expiration in a couple of weeks in the event that Facebook shares trade below the breakeven point at $44.06. Overall options volume on FB is relatively light, with roughly 225,000 contracts in play thus far below the combined recent daily average of 577,000 contracts, Trade Alert figures showed. Calls are more active than puts with the call-to-put ratio hovering near 1.38. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net   1337 ET 12Nov2013 Calls on JetBlue fly on broad strength in the airline sector  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Call options on JetBlue Airways Corp are flying and the stock rose 4.29 percent to $8.02 on broad strength in the airline sector after the U.S. reached an antitrust settlement on the US Airways-American Airlines case. US Airways Group Inc and American Airlines have agreed to give up landing spots and gates at several U.S. airports to win U.S. antitrust approval for their proposed merger, the Department of Justice said on Tuesday.  AMR Corp is the parent of bankrupt American Airlines. In options trading, a sweep of 5,578 November $8 strike calls traded on JetBlue at Tuesday mid-morning for 20 cents and then 22 minutes later, another 2,576 contracts for 24 cents, followed by another 5,000 for 30 cents, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. In all, the November $8 strike call traded 20,811 times thus far against 7,460 contracts in open interest, Trade Alert data showed. The December $7, December $8 and March $8 strike calls are active as well in JetBlue.

Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net 1114 ET 12Nov2013 Volatility ETN VXX draws large long-term put purchase  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A large put buyer on the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note appears to be speculating that the fund’s shares will be pared by more than half by early 2016. Shares of VXX, which recently saw a reverse split, are down 21 cents to $48.31 after hitting a new intraday low of $48.14 early on Tuesday. In the options market, one player bought 63,000 January 2016 $20 puts on the ETN for $3.75 per contract, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. The hefty premium purchase is probably a play on the longer-term downtrend in shares, which are affected by changes in S&P 500 implied volatility and backwardation/contango in the VIX futures market, he added. The ETN is based on the two front-month VIX futures, which typically carry a premium to the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net 1036 ET 12Nov2013 Strategists highlight key options trades this week  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Option order flow was muted on Monday, but there was interest to roll out protection from November to year-end in the emerging markets space, strategists said on Tuesday. About 640,000 puts traded in the iShares MSCI Emerging Market Fund on Monday versus 156,000 calls, according to Trade Alert. Shares of the exchange-traded fund closed at $40.95. One hefty put spread drove the higher volumes, as an investor was apparently selling 210,950 November $42.50 strike puts on the EEM for $1.60 and buying 250,000 December $41.5 puts for $1.55 per contract, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. Looking at open interest and trade history, the activity in the November $42.50 puts appears to be closing a position initiated a few weeks ago when EEM was trading around $42.55. A new position was opened in the December $41.5 puts. The position adjustment appears to be expressing concerns about additional losses for emerging markets over the next six weeks, Ruffy said. “These sorts of flows typically result in a steeping of EEM skew as put buyers overmatch those in demand for calls,” Credit Suisse derivative strategists said in a report on Tuesday. Of note was another print for the ETF on Monday where an investor bet against EEM skew by selling 30,000 December $38 puts to buy 30,000 December $44 calls and collecting 20 cents for the package, CS said. In equity options, Microsoft Corp continues to attract heavy call volume as investors digest expected management changes, said Dan Nathan, co-founder and editor of RiskReversal.com in a report late on Monday. A trader on Monday appeared to be taking profits by selling the January $33-$36 call spread, 20,000 times at $2.50 to close a position. In addition, he said there appeared to be a trader rolling up and out a bullish bet by selling 7,100 November $35 strike calls at $2.56 to close a position and bought February $40 strike calls for 74 cents to initiate a new position. Chinese Internet company SINA Corp reports earnings after the market’s close on Tuesday and the options market is implying about a 10 percent move for shares, up or down, Nathan said. The shares have realized an average move of about 6 percent over the past four quarters. With the stock down 15 percent in the last few weeks since making new two-year highs in mid October, a trader closed a bullish bet by selling the December $90-$110 call spread at $1.12, he said. Nathan noted that is appears like an odd sale considering it is a $20 wide call spread with an upcoming event and over a month to expiration in a stock that has the potential to make large moves with or without news. Facebook stock on Monday logged its third straight close below its 50-day moving average and is approaching key near term technical support at $45, Nathan said. A trader on Monday closed a now seemingly ambitious bullish bet by selling 12,500 December $60 calls at 19 cents, he added.

2012-10-24,-5,"The non-profit research consortium, to be known as the Cyber Security Research Alliance (CSRA), will also include Advanced Micro Devices, Honeywell International and EMC Corp’s RSA Security division as founding members. The consortium will coordinate industry research and work closely with government to develop “break-through technologies” to improve cybersecurity, said its president Lee Holcomb, a senior executive at Lockheed’s information systems and global solutions division. Initial prototypes could be developed within a year to 18 months, possibly addressing the security issues raised by the proliferation of so-called embedded devices, such as controllers in cars and the power grid, Holcomb told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We’re going to try to bring together the government, academia and industry to collectively lay out a road map for what are the critical problems and what are the technical solutions and approaches that may work,” he said. “How do we make it real?” U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta last week highlighted the growing threat of cyber attacks, noting that hackers were already going after banks and were developing the ability to strike U.S. power grids and government systems. An August cyber attack on Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, Saudi Aramco, that crippled some 30,000 computers, was probably the most destructive attack ever directed against the private sector, he said. U.S. financial institutions have been under sustained attack in recent weeks by suspected Iranian hackers. Ron Perez, director of security architecture at AMD, said the alliance grew out of an ad hoc group of industry executives that began meeting in late 2009. “What’s new here is the recognition that there are challenges out there that are bigger than any one company, any one university, or consortium of universities, and even bigger than what the government can do on their own,” he said. “To really address these problems, it’s going to take a long-term, well thought-out collaboration process,” Perez said. “And then we need to pick the low-hanging fruit and start delivering on some of those processes.” Holcomb said each of the five founding companies had paid $60,000 in membership dues, but 15 to 20 other companies had expressed interest in joining the non-profit alliance. The group also plans to convene a public symposium early next year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to connect researchers with officials from the private, academic and government sectors.

2014-05-23,-13,"U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily. The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff. The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates. Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. The companies’ combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought. “The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,” Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial. Based on that, I think the settlement is a significant achievement.” Devine did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment. Koh on May 16 approved separate settlements totaling $20 million over alleged poaching by Walt Disney Co’s Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and by Intuit Inc. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-02509. "

2012-09-17,-23,"The cable, dispatched from Washington on September 10, the day before protests erupted, advised the embassy the broadcasts could provoke violence. It did not direct specific measures to upgrade security, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, under standard diplomatic procedures, Egyptian government officials and security forces were notified of U.S. concerns, since host governments are responsible for ensuring the security of foreign diplomatic missions on their soil, the sources said. Copies of the cable were not sent to other U.S. outposts in the region, including the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where violence took the life of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The ties between the Benghazi violence and the crude anti-Muslim film are still unclear. The sources said the cable, which is still classified, was sparked by the broadcast on Saturday, September 8 by al-Nas, an Egyptian satellite TV network, of what its presenters described as extracts from an English-language film denigrating the Prophet Mohammad. That broadcast said the clips from the American film had been uploaded on the YouTube website by “migrant Coptics,” a reference to exiled members of a Christian sect with a large minority presence among Egypt’s Muslim majority. The film, called “Innocence of Muslims,” portrayed Mohammed as a womanizer, thug and child molester. In the warning cable, intelligence officials in Washington advised the embassy in Cairo the film clips had been translated into Arabic and were being disseminated via social media. It is not known if that posting was prompted by the U.S. intelligence warning. The statement was later pulled from the Internet because it was not coordinated with the State Department in Washington, the official said. While the TV broadcast of the clips, on a talk show hosted by an Islamist preacher, did not get much attention, once the material was posted on social media, including YouTube, it went viral. Through the cable, the U.S. Embassy was “made aware this is happening,” a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. Another source said that because the broadcast and concerns about possible violence were specific to Egypt, the warning message was not sent to other U.S. Middle Eastern outposts. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said staff were “well aware” that the video was being used to whip up strong feelings and could lead to demonstrations, and that most of the Cairo embassy staff had been instructed to stay home that day even before the protests began. “So when we had the difficulties, there was actually minimal staff in the building because we were already alerted and we had alerted the Egyptians as well,” she told a news briefing. Not long after violent protests broke out on Tuesday, September 11 at the embassy in Cairo, violence also broke out in Benghazi. In ensuing days, anti-Western protests, many of them violent, took place in Yemen, Tunisia, Sudan, Afghanistan and other Muslim-majority nations. President Barack Obama’s administration has strongly denied it had advance warning about the Libya attack and has said it is still trying to figure out how it occurred and who carried it out.

2012-03-23,-41,"* U.S. says no new secret facility detected * Electronic intercepts key to confidence in assessment By Tabassum Zakaria and Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - The United States, European allies and even Israel generally agree on three things about Iran’s nuclear program: Tehran does not have a bomb, has not decided to build one, and is probably years away from having a deliverable nuclear warhead. Those conclusions, drawn from extensive interviews with current and former U.S. and European officials with access to intelligence on Iran, contrast starkly with the heated debate surrounding a possible Israeli strike on Tehran’s nuclear facilities. “They’re keeping the soup warm but they are not cooking it,” a U.S. administration official said. Reuters has learned that in late 2006 or early 2007, U.S. intelligence intercepted telephone and email communications in which Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a leading figure in Iran’s nuclear program, and other scientists complained that the weaponization program had been stopped. That led to a bombshell conclusion in a controversial 2007 National Intelligence Estimate: American spy agencies had “high confidence” that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003. Current and former U.S. officials say they are confident that Iran has no secret uranium-enrichment site outside the purview of U.N. nuclear inspections. They also have confidence that any Iranian move toward building a functional nuclear weapon would be detected long before a bomb was made. These intelligence findings are what underpin President Barack Obama’s argument that there is still time to see whether economic sanctions will compel Iran’s leaders to halt any program. The Obama administration, relying on a top-priority intelligence collection program and after countless hours of debate, has concluded that Iranian leaders have not decided whether to actively construct a nuclear weapon, current and former officials said. There is little argument, however, that Iran’s leaders have taken steps that would give them the option of becoming a nuclear-armed power. Iran has enriched uranium, although not yet of sufficient quantity or purity to fuel a bomb, and has built secret enrichment sites, which were acknowledged only when unmasked. Iran has, in years past, worked on designing a nuclear warhead, the complicated package of electronics and explosives that would transform highly enriched uranium into a fission bomb. And it is developing missiles that could in theory launch such a weapon at a target in enemy territory. There are also blind spots in U.S. and allied agencies’ knowledge. A crucial unknown is the intentions of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another question is exactly how much progress Iran made in designing a warhead before mothballing its program. The allies disagree on how fast Iran is progressing toward bomb-building ability: the U.S. thinks progress is relatively slow; the Europeans and Israelis believe it’s faster. U.S. officials assert that intelligence reporting on Iran’s nuclear program is better than it was on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, which proved to be non-existent but which President George W. Bush and his aides used to make the case for the 2003 invasion. That case and others, such as the U.S. failure to predict India’s 1998 underground nuclear test, illustrate the perils of divining secrets about others’ weapons programs. “The quality of intelligence varies from case to case,” a U.S. administration official said. Intelligence on North Korea and Iraq was more limited, but there was “extraordinarily good intelligence” on Iran, the official said. Israel, which regards a nuclear Iran as an existential threat, has a different calculation. It studies the same intelligence and timetable, but sees a closing window of opportunity to take unilateral military action and set back Iran’s ambitions. Israel worries that Iran will soon have moved enough of its nuclear program underground -- or spread it far enough around the country -- as to make it virtually impervious to a unilateral Israeli attack, creating what Defense Minister Ehud Barak recently referred to as a “zone of immunity.” While Israel would not be able to launch an effective offensive in this analysis, the U.S., with its deeper-penetrating bombs and in-air refueling capability, believes it could still get results from a military strike. Israel has not publicly defined how or when Iran would enter this phase of a nuclear weapons program. Barak said last month that relying on an ability to detect an order by Khamenei to build a bomb “oversimplifies the issue dramatically.” Sources familiar with the intelligence confirmed the intercept of Fakhrizadeh’s communications. The United States had both telephone and email intercepts in which Iranian scientists complained about how the leadership ordered them to shut down the program in 2003, a senior European official said. U.S. officials said they are very confident that the intercepts were authentic - and not disinformation planted by Iran. “Iran has been a high-priority intelligence target for years. Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes we really are good,” said Thomas Fingar, who was chairman of the National Intelligence Council when it compiled the 2007 intelligence estimate. While declining to provide specific details, Fingar, now at Stanford University, said: “We got information that we had never been able to obtain before. We knew the provenance of the information, and we knew that we had been able to obtain it from multiple sources. Years of hard work had finally paid off.” The judgment that Iran had stopped work on the weapons program stunned the Bush White House and U.S. allies. Critics accused U.S. spy agencies of over-compensating for their flawed 2002 analysis that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had active nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. The 2007 report gummed up efforts by the Bush administration to persuade the U.N. Security Council and others to add pressure on Iran with more sanctions. It was greeted with disbelief by Israel and some European allies. “It really pulled the rug out of our sanctions effort until we got it back on track in 2008,” recalled Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to Bush. Overlooked by many was that the report said Iran had been pursuing a nuclear weapon and was keeping its options open for developing one, he said. “The problem was that it was misinterpreted as an all-clear when it wasn’t that at all,” Hadley said. A November 2011 report by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency said suspected nuclear weaponization efforts led by Fakhrizadeh were “stopped rather abruptly pursuant to a ‘halt order’ instruction issued in late 2003 by senior Iranian officials.” The reasons for this are not clear. Western experts say it was probably related to a fear of being next on the hit list after the United States toppled Saddam next door. Iran emphasizes its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. Ayatollah Khamenei this week said Iran does not have nuclear weapons and will not build them. Many European experts believed the Iranians had dismembered their bomb program and scattered and buried its parts, some of them in military or scientific installations, some in obscure academic institutions. Under pressure from both European allies and Israel’s supporters, U.S. intelligence agencies late in the Bush administration and early in Obama’s tenure began to take a second look at the 2007 estimate. Some consideration was given to bringing it more into line with European views. Intelligence received after publication of the 2007 estimate suggested that in 2006, Iran believed the United States was going to have to abandon its troubled venture in Iraq. Wisps of information were gathered that Iranian officials were talking about restarting elements of the bomb program, a U.S. intelligence official said on condition of anonymity. But analysts were divided about the significance of the new information. The revised estimate was delayed for months. Eventually, at the very end of 2010, an updated version was circulated within the government. Unlike the 2007 estimate, the White House made public no extracts of this document. A consensus emerged among U.S. experts that the new intelligence information wasn’t as alarming as originally thought, according to officials familiar with the result. The 2010 update largely stuck to the same assessments as the 2007 report, these officials said. U.S. intelligence chiefs issued a vague public acknowledgement of the ambiguities of their latest assessment. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress in February 2011 that “Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons in part by developing various nuclear capabilities that better position it to produce such weapons, should it choose to do so.” Both countries believe Iran has not made a decision to build a bomb, so even if Tehran decided to move forward, it would be unlikely to have a working nuclear device this year, let alone a missile to deliver it. “I think they are years away from having a nuclear weapon,” a U.S. administration official said. Three main pieces are needed for a nuclear arsenal: highly enriched uranium to fuel a bomb, a nuclear warhead to detonate it, and a missile or other platform to deliver it. For Iran’s program, the West has the most information about the first. Iran has a declared nuclear program for medical research and producing energy, is a member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and allows U.N. nuclear inspectors into its facilities. The inspections are conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its reports provide some of the best snapshots of where Iran’s program stands. Iran conducts uranium enrichment at the Natanz plant in central Iran and at a site at Fordow buried deep in a mountainous region near the holy city of Qom. Both sites were built secretly and made public by others. Natanz was unveiled in 2002 by an Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq. Obama and other world leaders announced the existence of the Fordow site in 2009. Natanz houses about 8,800 centrifuge machines spinning to increase the concentration of U-235, the type of uranium that  yields fissile material. Fordow is built to contain about 3,000 centrifuge machines, but the most recent IAEA report says about 700 are operational. Most of Iran’s stockpile is 3.5 percent low enriched uranium. When Tehran declared in February 2010 that it would begin enriching uranium up to 20 percent purity, that sharply increased the anxiety of Israel and others. Nuclear experts say that enriching uranium from the naturally occurring 0.7 percent concentration of U-235 to the low-level 3.5 percent accomplishes about 70 percent of the enrichment work toward weapons-grade uranium. At 20 percent concentration, about nine-tenths of the work has been completed. For Iran, getting to 90 percent would require changing some of the plumbing in the centrifuges, experts said. “From 20 to 90 is exponentially easier,” a U.S. intelligence official said. An IAEA report last month said that Iran has produced nearly 110 kilograms (240 pounds) of uranium enriched to 20 percent. That is less than the roughly 250 kilograms (550 pounds) that nuclear experts say would be required, when purified further, for one nuclear weapon. Iran’s enrichment program was set back by the Stuxnet computer virus, which many security experts suspect was created by Israeli intelligence, possibly with U.S. assistance. It wormed its way into Iranian centrifuge machinery as early as 2009. The Institute for Science and International Security estimated that Stuxnet damaged about 1,000 centrifuges at Natanz and stalled its enrichment capability from growing for about a year. But it isn’t clear how lasting an impact Stuxnet has had. Reuters reported last month that U.S. and European officials and private experts believe Iranian engineers have neutralized and purged the virus. The IAEA monitors Iran’s enrichment facilities closely, watching with cameras and taking measurements during inspections. Seals would have to be broken if containers that collect the enriched material were moved or tampered with. U.S. and European intelligence agencies are also keeping tabs through satellites, sensors and other methods. They watched for years as a hole was dug into a mountainside near Qom and determined - it is unclear precisely how - late in the Bush administration that Fordow was likely a secret uranium enrichment site. Obama was briefed on Qom when he was president-elect and was the one to publicly announce it to the world in September 2009. “They had a deep understanding of the facility, which allowed them to blow the whistle on Tehran with confidence,” a U.S. official said. Rumors periodically pop up of other secret enrichment sites, but so far they have not been substantiated. “Most of the people who make the argument that they might have a covert facility or a series of covert facilities are doing that to justify bombing them sooner rather than later,” said Colin Kahl, a former defense official focused on the Middle East. “We are very confident that there is no secret site now,” a U.S. administration official said. But given Iran’s history of secretly building facilities, the official predicted Tehran would eventually construct another covert plant. The more primitive the device, the more enriched uranium is required. Making it small enough to fit on the tip of a missile would be another challenge. The IAEA has information that Iran built a large containment chamber to conduct high-explosives tests at the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran. Conventional weapons are tested at that base, and the U.S. government appears convinced that any nuclear-related tests occurred prior to the 2003 halt. But Iran denied the IAEA access to the Parchin site in February, raising more suspicion, and the nuclear agency seems less confident that weapons work has halted altogether. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said recently, “We have information that some activity is ongoing there.” In its November 2011 report, the IAEA said it had “serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme.” It cited Iran’s efforts to procure nuclear-related and dual-use equipment, acquisition of nuclear-weapons development information and work on developing a nuclear weapon design in the program that was stopped in late 2003. “There are also indications that some activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device continued after 2003, and that some may still be ongoing,” the IAEA said. While Iran does not yet have a nuclear warhead that can fit on a missile, it does have the missiles. Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, and many of those projectiles could be repurposed to deliver a nuclear device, intelligence director Clapper said in congressional testimony. Western experts also point to Iran’s test firing of a rocket that can launch satellites into space as an example of a growing capability that could potentially be used for nuclear weapons. “The nuclear threat is growing. They are getting relatively close to the place where they can make the decision to assemble all three parts of their program -- enrichment, missile, weaponization,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said in an interview. Khamenei “hasn’t said ‘put it together’ yet,” said Rogers, a Republican. “Have they decided to sprint to making the device that blows up? Probably not. But are they walking to a device that blows up? Yes.” The debate over air strikes, supercharged by Israel’s anxiety and U.S. election-year politics, has raised the specter of the Iraq war. The White House justified that conflict on the grounds of weapons of mass destruction, as well as significant ties between Iraq and al Qaeda. Both proved to be mirages. “There are lots of disturbing similarities. One has to note the differences, too,” said Paul Pillar, a former top CIA analyst. “The huge difference being we don’t have an administration in office that is the one hankering for the war. This administration is not hankering for a war,” said Pillar."
2012-04-29,-13,"The mission’s goal is clear. “(The) focus is the removal of Joseph Kony and senior Lord’s Resistance Army leadership from the battlefield,” said Captain Ken Wright, a navy SEAL in command of the roughly 100-strong force which deployed in October. Kony has evaded the region’s militaries for nearly three decades, kidnapping tens of thousands of children to fill his militia’s ranks and serve as sex slaves as he moves through the bush. Thousands more have died in the wake of his brutal army. The deployment of elite American forces to help track Kony and his senior commanders in the dense equatorial jungle across a region that spans several countries has raised hopes the sadistic warlord’s days are numbered. The troops are armed but do not patrol the surrounding forests and are allowed to engage the LRA only in self-defense. Instead, their focus is on improving intelligence on LRA positions gathered both electronically and from tip-offs. By meshing stories from hunters and nomadic cattle herders of encounters with the rebels together with sophisticated surveillance imagery, allied forces chart suspected rebel activity and coordinate the regional armies’ pursuit of Kony. “You look at patterns to see where LRA might be moving, historic areas where they might operate, so we can predict where they’re going and try and head them off and most effectively use the forces on the ground,” Captain Gregory, a 29-year-old Texan hidden behind sunglasses and a wide brimmed hat told Reuters. For many of the U.S. troops who have recently served in Afghanistan and Iraq, the humid jungles of central Africa are unfamiliar territory. Their deployment raised expectations locally that U.S. drones would be unearthing Kony. They are not, and this hostile environment is throwing up unforeseen challenges. ”Some of the gear we have here is affected by the vegetation ... and acts differently from in the desert. “Vegetation absorbs signals and sounds,” said Gregory. In December 2008, after last-ditch peace talks failed, Ugandan paratroopers and fighter jets struck the LRA’s Congo hideouts. Kony slipped through the net, raising suspicions he had been tipped off. He and many of his combatants moved north into CAR. Kony was thrust back into the spotlight earlier this year when a video, “Kony 2012”, highlighting the chilling mutilations, rapes and murders carried out by his spell-bound fighters went viral on the Internet. Bruce Wharton, deputy assistant secretary in the Department of State’s Africa bureau said the deployment of special forces was in part a response to legislation in 2010 calling on the Obama administration to do more to tackle Kony. “I think Kony, for lack of an ideology, for lack of a political agenda, for lack of an intellectually identifiable cause, and for the brutality with which he operates, is at the top of the list of international bad guys,” Wharton said. Asked whether hunting Kony offered a convenient way of expanding the U.S. military footprint in Africa, Wharton told Reuters: “I absolutely think that as soon as this mission is accomplished the roughly 100 troops will go away.” Facing war crimes charges, Kony has transformed himself from a one-time altar boy to a master of jungle survival and evasion. His fighters have become increasingly savvy in concealing their movements, wading through crocodile-infested rivers and walking backwards and in loops to disguise their tracks. The vicious and often drugged rebels first struck Obo in the early hours of March 6, 2009. They targeted the town’s Catholic mission, abducting 76 people. “We were told they were coming but we didn’t believe they would attack the town,” said Obo resident Ricardo Dimanche who runs a community radio project urging LRA fighters to give up their weapons. “The next year they started attacking the small villages around us. Displaced people started flooding in,” said Dimanche. Underscoring the challenge facing the American and regional troops, the LRA launched almost as many attacks in the first three months of this year in CAR as in all of last year, according to U.N. data. “Nobody has peace of mind now,” said Dimanche. U.S. military officials are reluctant to bet on if and when they might snare Kony. “The global effort to try to find Osama bin Laden took 10 years with an extraordinary level of effort ... the highest priority for the international intelligence community, and it still took 10 years to find him,” General Carter Ham, commander of the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) told a media briefing in Germany ahead of the tightly controlled trip. “So this is a tough mission.”"
2013-01-14,-1,"“We have made a commitment that al Qaeda is not going to find anyplace to hide,” U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters on his plane as he began a week-long tour of European capitals. Just as the United States pursued militants affiliated with al Qaeda to northern Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, “we have a responsibility to make sure that al Qaeda does not establish a base for operations in North Africa in Mali,” he said. France intervened in Mali on Friday in an effort to block an advance by rebels who the West fear could use the West African nation as a launching pad for international attacks. Paris has poured hundreds of troops into the Malian capital and carried out more air raids on Monday in the vast desert area seized last year by al Qaeda’s north African wing AQIM and Mali’s home-grown MUJWA and Ansar Dine militant groups. Panetta praised France for the steps it had taken and said he had been in talks with French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian about what assistance he needed. The Pentagon was looking at providing help in three areas, he added. “One is obviously to provide limited logistical support, two is to provide intelligence support and three to provide some airlift capability,” Panetta told the briefing on his plane. A senior U.S. defense official said the United States was already sharing information with the French and would continue to do so. Panetta declined to say whether the intelligence support would be in the form of satellite images or unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. He indicated the airlift support under discussion involved cargo planes and a defense official said the logistic support included tanker aircraft for aerial refueling. “We are engaged in those discussions. Africom (U.S. Africa Command) is discussing this with France and will continue to work with them to ensure that ultimately we do stop AQIM,” said Panetta, who received a briefing from the head of Africom, General Carter Ham, during his flight to Lisbon. “The responsibility for assuring security in that region will be passed to African nations to provide a more permanent security for the sake of the world,” he said. “While they might not have any immediate plans for attacks in the United States and Europe ... ultimately that still remains their objective and it’s for that reason that we have to take steps now to ensure that AQIM does not get that kind of traction,” Panetta said. His comments came at the outset of a trip that is likely to be his last as U.S. defense secretary and will take him to Lisbon, Madrid, Rome and London. Describing himself as a “son of Europe,” the Italian-American defense secretary said it was appropriate to finish his time in office with a visit to NATO partners, adding that he wanted to underscore the importance of the alliance to a new generation of Europeans. Panetta said he would brief his counterparts on talks last week between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. President Barack Obama. Karzai and Obama discussed the nature of the U.S. military presence, if any, in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of most combat troops at the end of 2014. They agreed that Afghan forces would take the lead role for security beginning this spring, in what was described as a slight acceleration of the mid-2013 transition timetable. Panetta, the first U.S. defense secretary to visit Portugal in 30 years, said he would discuss plans to reduce the U.S. military presence at Lajes Air Field in the Azores. "
2015-05-04,-8,"The ownership of Abyei, which has rich pastureland and small oil reserves, was left undecided when South Sudan declared independence from Sudan in 2011. It remains one of the biggest potential flashpoints between the two countries, who have also argued over oil rights and other disputed territories. On March 2, U.N. peacekeepers in the Abyei region, known as UNISFA, responded to an attack on the village of Marial Achak by 100 armed individuals from the Misseriya community, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in his latest report to the Security Council on Abyei. Three people were killed in the attack, four children abducted and 24 houses destroyed, Ban said. “UNISFA responded swiftly to the incident and was able to intercept the armed men fleeing north from Marial Achak,” his report said. After an exchange of fire, UNISFA troops captured eight of the armed assailants, who had five AK-47 rifles, over 400 rounds of ammunition, three motorcycles, and a Motorola radio set. “Among the eight detainees were one logistics officer from a local militia group, Tora Bora, and one individual who identified himself as a Sudan Armed Forces intelligence officer,” Ban’s report said. The report noted that Khartoum denied that a Sudanese officer took part in the attack, which it blamed on a rebel group. Sudan’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Hassan Hamid Hassan told Reuters the allegation was “totally not true.” If confirmed, the presence of a Sudanese officer with local militia could suggest that Khartoum may be helping armed elements around Abyei coordinate attacks. Ban said Khartoum also alleged that the Misseriya militia was retaliating after an attack by elements of the Dinka Ngok community, who occupy much of the Abyei region, on Al-Shagag village on Feb. 26. It said those militants were based in Marial Achak and supported by the South Sudanese army. UNISFA could not confirm the Al-Shagag attack, the report said. Ban appealed to both Sudan and South Sudan to ensure that armed forces allied to them remain outside the Abyei area. He added that the abduction of children was “particularly deplorable and unacceptable.” South Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war since December 2013.

2013-01-14,-1,"* Pentagon chief to discuss Azores drawdown decision * Likely Panetta’s last trip abroad as defense secretary By David Alexander LISBON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States is sharing information with French forces battling al Qaeda-affiliated militants in Mali and is  considering providing logistics, surveillance and airlift capability as well, U.S. defense officials said on Monday. “We have made a commitment that al Qaeda is not going to find anyplace to hide,” U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters on his plane as he began a week-long tour of European capitals.

2014-04-25,-26,"The comments reflect a growing conviction among Western capitals that President Bashar al-Assad has failed to come clean about Syria’s chemical weapons program despite his promises to end it, and they insist the United States and its allies will resist calls by Assad to shut down a special international chemical disarmament mission set up to deal with Syria. Syria denies it maintains the capacity to deploy chemical weapons, calling the allegation a U.S. and European attempt to use their “childish” policies to blackmail Assad’s government. But in a tacit acknowledgement of the original declaration’s incompleteness, Syria earlier this month submitted a more specific list of its chemical weapons to the international disarmament mission after discrepancies were reported by inspectors on the ground, officials said. Under threat of U.S. airstrikes, Assad agreed with the United States and Russia in September to dispose of his chemical weapons - an arsenal that Damascus had never previously formally acknowledged - after hundreds of people were killed in a sarin gas attack in August on the outskirts of the capital. Washington and its Western allies said it was Assad’s forces who unleashed the sarin attack, the world’s worst chemical attack in a quarter-century. The government blamed the rebel side in Syria’s civil war, which is now in its fourth year. The verification of Syria’s declaration on its poison gas arsenal and its destruction has been overseen by a joint team of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the global chemical arms watchdog. Diplomats say Western governments have long suspected Syria did not declare all aspects of its chemical arms program. But the envoys say they have kept silent on the issue to avoid giving Assad an excuse to curtail cooperation with the U.N.-OPCW mission and slow down an already delayed timetable for shipping toxins out of the country. With more than 90 percent of Syria’s declared chemical stockpiles now out of the country, Western officials have started to break their silence. “We are convinced, and we have some intelligence showing, that they have not declared everything,” a senior Western diplomat told Reuters, adding that the intelligence had come from Britain, France and the United States. When asked how much of its program Syria has kept hidden, the diplomat said: “It’s substantial.” He offered no details. “These countries aren’t really reliable and their policies towards the implementation of the agreement between the Syrian government and the OPCW aren’t principled but rather childish,” he said in a mobile-phone text message to Reuters. “If they have some evidence they must share it with the OPCW rather than pretending to have secret evidence!” Ja‘afari said the three Western powers’ goal was to needlessly extend the U.N.-OPCW mission by “keeping the ‘chemical file’ open indefinitely so that they can keep exerting pressure and blackmailing the Syrian government.” Another Western official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that while there was not 100 percent certainty Syria maintains chemical weapons, the three Western powers agreed that there is a “high level of probability” that Syria deliberately under-reported the full extent of its chemical arms-related stockpiles. He cited examples of large batch of a sarin precursor chemical going missing in Syria and Damascus’ unverified claims to have destroyed most of its mustard gas stocks before the U.N.-OPCW mission arrived in the country and other anomalies. In interviews over the last two months with Western officials with access to intelligence about Syria, Reuters learned that topics of concern include deadly nerve agent ricin, mustard gas, precursor chemicals used to make sarin, and, more recently, the use of chlorine gas in Syria. U.S. and British officials have also spoken of ambiguities and problems with the Syrian chemical weapons declaration. U.S. officials warned as early as November that intelligence suggested Syria may try to hide some toxins. Suspicions that its declaration was incomplete deepened when Syria did not report to the OPCW having sarin, which was used in the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21, or the type of rockets used to deliver an estimated 300 liters of the toxin. The senior Western diplomat said Britain, France and the United States had provided information to the OPCW months ago, including on specific undeclared chemical weapons sites. He added that the three powers had also provided Assad’s staunch ally Russia with the intelligence but “they have not reacted.” The OPCW had no immediate comment when queried. A Russian U.N. mission spokesman said he had no comment, though Moscow reiterated on Friday its position that claims about the Syrian government using chemicals weapons were false.

2015-01-15,1,"By Alina Selyukh and Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - No existing technology can fully replace collecting data in bulk to obtain electronic intelligence, but some methods could be developed to improve how information is gathered and used, the U.S. National Research Council said in a report on Thursday. The report, sponsored by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was in response to President Barack Obama’s call last year for a review of potential software-based alternatives to the controversial program. “There are no technical alternatives that can accomplish the same functions as bulk collection and serve as a complete substitute for it; there is no technological magic,” the report said. The program came to light following explosive revelations in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. government was collecting and storing bulk telephone records of calls made to and from U.S. citizens. NSA eavesdroppers collected only so-called “metadata” - the time, length and phone numbers of the calls - and not actual content. Intelligence officials maintain that collecting telephone metadata in bulk is critical to U.S. counter-terrorism efforts. However, a blue-ribbon panel set up by Obama following Snowden’s revelations reported it could find no evidence that sweeping collection of the telephone metadata of Americans led to a single major counter-terrorism breakthrough. The National Research Council report focused on the technology of all types of electronic communication and not just domestic telephone metadata. “A choice to eliminate all forms of bulk collection would have costs in intelligence capabilities,” Council researchers, who came from universities across the country and top technology companies such as Google Inc and IBM Corp, said in the report. They did say, however, that it might be possible in some cases to develop techniques that improve targeting and provide a viable substitute for bulk collection. The report also said some methods could be developed to help allay privacy and civil liberties concerns. It suggested approaches such as automated systems for isolating data, restricting queries relating to the information and auditing its use.

2013-08-05,-25,"Although the DEA program may use legal means to collect and distribute the tips, critics say that by hiding the origin of a case, defendants may not know about potentially exculpatory evidence. “It’s my understanding… that the Department of Justice is looking at some of the issues raised in the story,” Carney said during his daily briefing at the White House on Monday. Carney referred reporters to a Justice Department spokesman, who confirmed that a review was under way, but declined further comment. In an interview with Reuters last month, two senior DEA officials defended the program, saying it has been in place since the late 1990s, has been reviewed by every Attorney General since then, and is perfectly legal. One DEA official said “parallel construction” is used every day by agents and police nationwide and is “a bedrock concept.” The program, run by DEA’s Special Operations Division, differs in several respects from National Security Agency activities revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Among these is disclosure to the accused. Collection of domestic data by the NSA and FBI for espionage and terrorism cases is regulated by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If prosecutors intend to use FISA or other classified evidence in court, they issue a public notice, and a judge determines whether the defense is entitled to review the evidence. In the DEA’s case, a document reviewed by Reuters shows that federal drug agents are trained to “recreate” the investigative trail to conceal the SOD’s involvement. Defense attorneys say the practice prevents defendants from even knowing about evidence that might help their cases. In a statement, the NSA said that it cannot use the telephone database program exposed by Snowden for law enforcement purposes. However, the NSA said that it does coordinate with law enforcement. “This coordination frequently includes sanitizing classified information so that it can be passed to personnel at lower clearance levels in order to meet their operational requirements,” the NSA statement said. “If the Intelligence Community collects information pursuant to a valid foreign intelligence tasking that is recognized as being evidence of a crime, the intelligence community can disseminate that information to law enforcement, as appropriate.” While the NSA activities are aimed at terrorists, the SOD program focuses on drug dealers and money launders. That distinction troubles some civil libertarians, who fear secretive measures designed to target terrorists are being used to catch ordinary criminals. Jerry Cox, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), said defense lawyers “long feared that overbroad national security policies would become the norm for all criminal prosecutions and today we know our concerns were not unfounded.” Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Criminal Law Reform Project, said the SOD procedures violate the fundamental right to a fair trial. “When someone is accused of a crime, the Constitution guarantees the right to examine the government’s evidence, including its sources, and confront the witnesses against them,” he said. “Our due process rights are at risk when our federal government hides and distorts the sources of evidence used as the basis for arrests and prosecutions.” "
2014-01-27,-6,"The Times said the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters, had tried to exploit increasing volumes of personal data that spill onto networks from new generations of mobile phone technology. Among these new intelligence tools were “leaky” apps on smartphones that could disclose users’ locations, age, gender and other personal information. The U.S. and British agencies were working together on ways to collect and store data from smartphone apps by 2007, the newspaper reported. The agencies have traded methods for collecting location data from a user of Google Maps and for gathering address books, buddy lists, phone logs and geographic data embedded in photos when a user posts to the mobile versions of Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter and other services, the Times said. Snowden, who is living in asylum in Russian, faces espionage charges in the United States after disclosing the NSA’s massive telephone and Internet surveillance programs last year. His revelations and the resulting firestorm of criticism from politicians and privacy rights activists prompted U.S. President Barack Obama to announce intelligence-gather reforms on January 17, including a ban on eavesdropping on the leaders of close allies and limits on the collection of telephone data. The Times report said the scale of the data collection from smartphones was not clear but the documents showed that the two national agencies routinely obtained information from certain apps, including some of the earliest ones introduced to mobile phones. The documents did not say how many users were affected or whether they included Americans. White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. surveillance agencies were only interested in collecting data on people considered a threat to the United States. “To the extent data is collected by the NSA through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets, and we are not after the information of ordinary Americans,” Carney told a regular White House news conference. Any such surveillance was focused on “valid foreign intelligence targets ... I mean terrorists, proliferators, other bad actors (who) use the same communications tools that others use,” he said. "
2012-08-19,-3,"Germany’s Bild am Sonntag said the boat had spying equipment from the German intelligence service on board, enabling it to observe Syrian troop movements up to 600 km (375 miles) inland. Information on the military operations of President Bashar al-Assad’s troops that is collected by the ship is passed on to U.S. and British secret services, who then give it to the Free Syrian Army, Bild said. A spokesman for the German Defence Ministry said a German navy ship equipped with telecommunications and reconnaissance technology that normally patrols the international waters of the eastern Mediterranean was in a harbour in Sardinia. Ships of this type are used to collect information but the ministry would not comment on details, he said. A German government spokesman said the government did not comment on intelligence service activities. The German intelligence service declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office declined to comment. She reiterated that Britain was giving non-lethal support to Syria’s opposition. No one was immediately available for comment at the U.S. State Department. Bild also said German intelligence service agents were stationed at a NATO base in the Turkish city of Adana, where they were intercepting telephone calls and radio communications from Syria. They are also maintaining informal contact with sources close to Assad’s government, the paper said. Assad is battling a 17-month uprising against 42 years of rule by his family, and Syria’s civil war has intensified since a July bombing killed members of Assad’s inner circle including his defence minister and brother-in-law."
2012-03-23,-39,"“They’re keeping the soup warm but they are not cooking it,” a U.S. administration official said. Reuters has learned that in late 2006 or early 2007, U.S. intelligence intercepted telephone and email communications in which Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a leading figure in Iran’s nuclear program, and other scientists complained that the weaponization program had been stopped. That led to a bombshell conclusion in a controversial 2007 National Intelligence Estimate: American spy agencies had “high confidence” that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003. Current and former U.S. officials say they are confident that Iran has no secret uranium-enrichment site outside the purview of U.N. nuclear inspections. They also have confidence that any Iranian move toward building a functional nuclear weapon would be detected long before a bomb was made. These intelligence findings are what underpin President Barack Obama’s argument that there is still time to see whether economic sanctions will compel Iran’s leaders to halt any program. The Obama administration, relying on a top-priority intelligence collection program and after countless hours of debate, has concluded that Iranian leaders have not decided whether to actively construct a nuclear weapon, current and former officials said. There is little argument, however, that Iran’s leaders have taken steps that would give them the option of becoming a nuclear-armed power. Iran has enriched uranium, although not yet of sufficient quantity or purity to fuel a bomb, and has built secret enrichment sites, which were acknowledged only when unmasked. Iran has, in years past, worked on designing a nuclear warhead, the complicated package of electronics and explosives that would transform highly enriched uranium into a fission bomb. And it is developing missiles that could in theory launch such a weapon at a target in enemy territory. There are also blind spots in U.S. and allied agencies’ knowledge. A crucial unknown is the intentions of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another question is exactly how much progress Iran made in designing a warhead before mothballing its program. The allies disagree on how fast Iran is progressing toward bomb-building ability: the U.S. thinks progress is relatively slow; the Europeans and Israelis believe it’s faster. U.S. officials assert that intelligence reporting on Iran’s nuclear program is better than it was on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, which proved to be non-existent but which President George W. Bush and his aides used to make the case for the 2003 invasion. That case and others, such as the U.S. failure to predict India’s 1998 underground nuclear test, illustrate the perils of divining secrets about others’ weapons programs. “The quality of intelligence varies from case to case,” a U.S. administration official said. Intelligence on North Korea and Iraq was more limited, but there was “extraordinarily good intelligence” on Iran, the official said. Israel, which regards a nuclear Iran as an existential threat, has a different calculation. It studies the same intelligence and timetable, but sees a closing window of opportunity to take unilateral military action and set back Iran’s ambitions. Israel worries that Iran will soon have moved enough of its nuclear program underground -- or spread it far enough around the country -- as to make it virtually impervious to a unilateral Israeli attack, creating what Defense Minister Ehud Barak recently referred to as a “zone of immunity.” While Israel would not be able to launch an effective offensive in this analysis, the U.S., with its deeper-penetrating bombs and in-air refueling capability, believes it could still get results from a military strike. Israel has not publicly defined how or when Iran would enter this phase of a nuclear weapons program. Barak said last month that relying on an ability to detect an order by Khamenei to build a bomb “oversimplifies the issue dramatically.” Sources familiar with the intelligence confirmed the intercept of Fakhrizadeh’s communications. The United States had both telephone and email intercepts in which Iranian scientists complained about how the leadership ordered them to shut down the program in 2003, a senior European official said. U.S. officials said they are very confident that the intercepts were authentic - and not disinformation planted by Iran. “Iran has been a high-priority intelligence target for years. Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes we really are good,” said Thomas Fingar, who was chairman of the National Intelligence Council when it compiled the 2007 intelligence estimate. While declining to provide specific details, Fingar, now at Stanford University, said: “We got information that we had never been able to obtain before. We knew the provenance of the information, and we knew that we had been able to obtain it from multiple sources. Years of hard work had finally paid off.” The judgment that Iran had stopped work on the weapons program stunned the Bush White House and U.S. allies. Critics accused U.S. spy agencies of over-compensating for their flawed 2002 analysis that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had active nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. The 2007 report gummed up efforts by the Bush administration to persuade the U.N. Security Council and others to add pressure on Iran with more sanctions. It was greeted with disbelief by Israel and some European allies. “It really pulled the rug out of our sanctions effort until we got it back on track in 2008,” recalled Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to Bush. Overlooked by many was that the report said Iran had been pursuing a nuclear weapon and was keeping its options open for developing one, he said. “The problem was that it was misinterpreted as an all-clear when it wasn’t that at all,” Hadley said. A November 2011 report by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency said suspected nuclear weaponization efforts led by Fakhrizadeh were “stopped rather abruptly pursuant to a ‘halt order’ instruction issued in late 2003 by senior Iranian officials.” The reasons for this are not clear. Western experts say it was probably related to a fear of being next on the hit list after the United States toppled Saddam next door. Iran emphasizes its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. Ayatollah Khamenei this week said Iran does not have nuclear weapons and will not build them. Many European experts believed the Iranians had dismembered their bomb program and scattered and buried its parts, some of them in military or scientific installations, some in obscure academic institutions. Under pressure from both European allies and Israel’s supporters, U.S. intelligence agencies late in the Bush administration and early in Obama’s tenure began to take a second look at the 2007 estimate. Some consideration was given to bringing it more into line with European views. Intelligence received after publication of the 2007 estimate suggested that in 2006, Iran believed the United States was going to have to abandon its troubled venture in Iraq. Wisps of information were gathered that Iranian officials were talking about restarting elements of the bomb program, a U.S. intelligence official said on condition of anonymity. But analysts were divided about the significance of the new information. The revised estimate was delayed for months. Eventually, at the very end of 2010, an updated version was circulated within the government. Unlike the 2007 estimate, the White House made public no extracts of this document. A consensus emerged among U.S. experts that the new intelligence information wasn’t as alarming as originally thought, according to officials familiar with the result. The 2010 update largely stuck to the same assessments as the 2007 report, these officials said. U.S. intelligence chiefs issued a vague public acknowledgement of the ambiguities of their latest assessment. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress in February 2011 that “Iran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons in part by developing various nuclear capabilities that better position it to produce such weapons, should it choose to do so.” Both countries believe Iran has not made a decision to build a bomb, so even if Tehran decided to move forward, it would be unlikely to have a working nuclear device this year, let alone a missile to deliver it. “I think they are years away from having a nuclear weapon,” a U.S. administration official said. Three main pieces are needed for a nuclear arsenal: highly enriched uranium to fuel a bomb, a nuclear warhead to detonate it, and a missile or other platform to deliver it. For Iran’s program, the West has the most information about the first. Iran has a declared nuclear program for medical research and producing energy, is a member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and allows U.N. nuclear inspectors into its facilities. The inspections are conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its reports provide some of the best snapshots of where Iran’s program stands. Iran conducts uranium enrichment at the Natanz plant in central Iran and at a site at Fordow buried deep in a mountainous region near the holy city of Qom. Both sites were built secretly and made public by others. Natanz was unveiled in 2002 by an Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq. Obama and other world leaders announced the existence of the Fordow site in 2009. Natanz houses about 8,800 centrifuge machines spinning to increase the concentration of U-235, the type of uranium that yields fissile material. Fordow is built to contain about 3,000 centrifuge machines, but the most recent IAEA report says about 700 are operational. Most of Iran’s stockpile is 3.5 percent low enriched uranium. When Tehran declared in February 2010 that it would begin enriching uranium up to 20 percent purity, that sharply increased the anxiety of Israel and others. Nuclear experts say that enriching uranium from the naturally occurring 0.7 percent concentration of U-235 to the low-level 3.5 percent accomplishes about 70 percent of the enrichment work toward weapons-grade uranium. At 20 percent concentration, about nine-tenths of the work has been completed. For Iran, getting to 90 percent would require changing some of the plumbing in the centrifuges, experts said. “From 20 to 90 is exponentially easier,” a U.S. intelligence official said. An IAEA report last month said that Iran has produced nearly 110 kilograms (240 pounds) of uranium enriched to 20 percent. That is less than the roughly 250 kilograms (550 pounds) that nuclear experts say would be required, when purified further, for one nuclear weapon. But it isn’t clear how lasting an impact Stuxnet has had. Reuters reported last month that U.S. and European officials and private experts believe Iranian engineers have neutralized and purged the virus. The IAEA monitors Iran’s enrichment facilities closely, watching with cameras and taking measurements during inspections. Seals would have to be broken if containers that collect the enriched material were moved or tampered with. U.S. and European intelligence agencies are also keeping tabs through satellites, sensors and other methods. They watched for years as a hole was dug into a mountainside near Qom and determined - it is unclear precisely how - late in the Bush administration that Fordow was likely a secret uranium enrichment site. Obama was briefed on Qom when he was president-elect and was the one to publicly announce it to the world in September 2009. “They had a deep understanding of the facility, which allowed them to blow the whistle on Tehran with confidence,” a U.S. official said. Rumors periodically pop up of other secret enrichment sites, but so far they have not been substantiated. “Most of the people who make the argument that they might have a covert facility or a series of covert facilities are doing that to justify bombing them sooner rather than later,” said Colin Kahl, a former defense official focused on the Middle East. “We are very confident that there is no secret site now,” a U.S. administration official said. But given Iran’s history of secretly building facilities, the official predicted Tehran would eventually construct another covert plant. The more primitive the device, the more enriched uranium is required. Making it small enough to fit on the tip of a missile would be another challenge. The IAEA has information that Iran built a large containment chamber to conduct high-explosives tests at the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran. Conventional weapons are tested at that base, and the U.S. government appears convinced that any nuclear-related tests occurred prior to the 2003 halt. But Iran denied the IAEA access to the Parchin site in February, raising more suspicion, and the nuclear agency seems less confident that weapons work has halted altogether. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said recently, “We have information that some activity is ongoing there.” In its November 2011 report, the IAEA said it had “serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear program.” It cited Iran’s efforts to procure nuclear-related and dual-use equipment, acquisition of nuclear-weapons development information and work on developing a nuclear weapon design in the program that was stopped in late 2003. “There are also indications that some activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device continued after 2003, and that some may still be ongoing,” the IAEA said. While Iran does not yet have a nuclear warhead that can fit on a missile, it does have the missiles. Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, and many of those projectiles could be repurposed to deliver a nuclear device, intelligence director Clapper said in congressional testimony. Western experts also point to Iran’s test firing of a rocket that can launch satellites into space as an example of a growing capability that could potentially be used for nuclear weapons. “The nuclear threat is growing. They are getting relatively close to the place where they can make the decision to assemble all three parts of their program -- enrichment, missile, weaponization,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said in an interview. Khamenei “hasn’t said ‘put it together’ yet,” said Rogers, a Republican. “Have they decided to sprint to making the device that blows up? Probably not. But are they walking to a device that blows up? Yes.” The debate over air strikes, supercharged by Israel’s anxiety and U.S. election-year politics, has raised the specter of the Iraq war. The White House justified that conflict on the grounds of weapons of mass destruction, as well as significant ties between Iraq and al Qaeda. Both proved to be mirages. “There are lots of disturbing similarities. One has to note the differences, too,” said Paul Pillar, a former top CIA analyst. “The huge difference being we don’t have an administration in office that is the one hankering for the war. This administration is not hankering for a war,” said Pillar. "
2013-08-07,-22,"A 350-word entry in the Internal Revenue Manual instructed agents of the U.S. tax agency to omit any reference to tips supplied by the DEA’s Special Operations Division, especially from affidavits, court proceedings or investigative files. The entry was published and posted online in 2005 and 2006, and was removed in early 2007. The IRS is among two dozen arms of the government working with the Special Operations Division, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. An IRS spokesman had no comment on the entry or on why it was removed from the manual. Reuters recovered the previous editions from the archives of the Westlaw legal database, which is owned by Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent of this news agency. As Reuters reported Monday, the Special Operations Division of the DEA funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans. The DEA phone database is distinct from a NSA database disclosed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Monday’s Reuters report cited internal government documents that show that law enforcement agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin - to “recreate” the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information. DEA officials said the practice is legal and has been in near-daily use since the 1990s. They have said that its purpose is to protect sources and methods, not to withhold evidence. The IRS document offers further detail on the parallel construction program. “Special Operations Division has the ability to collect, collate, analyze, evaluate, and disseminate information and intelligence derived from worldwide multi-agency sources, including classified projects,” the IRS document says. “SOD converts extremely sensitive information into usable leads and tips which are then passed to the field offices for real-time enforcement activity against major international drug trafficking organizations.” The 2005 IRS document focuses on SOD tips that are classified and notes that the Justice Department “closely guards the information provided by SOD with strict oversight.” While the IRS document says that SOD information may only be used for drug investigations, DEA officials said the SOD role has recently expanded to organized crime and money laundering. According to the document, IRS agents are directed to use the tips to find new, “independent” evidence: “Usable information regarding these leads must be developed from such independent sources as investigative files, subscriber and toll requests, physical surveillance, wire intercepts, and confidential source information. Information obtained from SOD in response to a search or query request cannot be used directly in any investigation (i.e. cannot be used in affidavits, court proceedings or maintained in investigative files).” The IRS document makes no reference to SOD’s sources of information, which include a large DEA telephone and Internet database. “If they’re recreating a trail, that’s wrong and we’re going to have to do something about it,” said Rogers, a former FBI agent. “We’re working with the DEA and intelligence organizations to try to find out exactly what that story is.” Spokespeople for the DEA and the Department of Justice declined to comment. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, a member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, said he was troubled that DEA agents have been “trying to cover up a program that investigates Americans.” “National security is one of government’s most important functions. So is protecting individual liberty,” Paul said. “If the Constitution still has any sway, a government that is constantly overreaching on security while completely neglecting liberty is in grave violation of our founding doctrine.” Officials have stressed that the NSA and DEA telephone databases are distinct. The NSA database, disclosed by Snowden, includes data about every telephone call placed inside the United States. An NSA official said that database is not used for domestic criminal law enforcement. The DEA database, called DICE, consists largely of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. DICE includes about 1 billion records, and they are kept for about a year and then purged, DEA officials said. "
2015-05-04,-8,"The ownership of Abyei, which has rich pastureland and small oil reserves, was left undecided when South Sudan declared independence from Sudan in 2011. It remains one of the biggest potential flashpoints between the two countries, who have also argued over oil rights and other disputed territories. On March 2, U.N. peacekeepers in the Abyei region, known as UNISFA, responded to an attack on the village of Marial Achak by 100 armed individuals from the Misseriya community, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in his latest report to the Security Council on Abyei. Three people were killed in the attack, four children abducted and 24 houses destroyed, Ban said. “UNISFA responded swiftly to the incident and was able to intercept the armed men fleeing north from Marial Achak,” his report said. After an exchange of fire, UNISFA troops captured eight of the armed assailants, who had five AK-47 rifles, over 400 rounds of ammunition, three motorcycles, and a Motorola radio set.  “Among the eight detainees were one logistics officer from a local militia group, Tora Bora, and one individual who identified himself as a Sudan Armed Forces intelligence officer,” Ban’s report said.  The report noted that Khartoum denied that a Sudanese officer took part in the attack, which it blamed on a rebel group. Sudan’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Hassan Hamid Hassan told Reuters the allegation was “totally not true.”  If confirmed, the presence of a Sudanese officer with local militia could suggest that Khartoum may be helping armed elements around Abyei coordinate attacks. Ban said Khartoum also alleged that the Misseriya militia was retaliating after an attack by elements of the Dinka Ngok community, who occupy much of the Abyei region, on Al-Shagag village on Feb. 26. It said those militants were based in Marial Achak and supported by the South Sudanese army.  UNISFA could not confirm the Al-Shagag attack, the report said. Ban appealed to both Sudan and South Sudan to ensure that armed forces allied to them remain outside the Abyei area. He added that the abduction of children was “particularly deplorable and unacceptable.” South Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war since December 2013. "

2012-07-25,-10,"The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, passed the Democratic Party-controlled committee by a 14-1 vote on Tuesday, Chairman Dianne Feinstein and Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss said in a statement. Media reports in recent months based on high-profile leaks about U.S. cyber-warfare against Iran, procedures for targeting militants with drones and a double agent who penetrated a militant group in Yemen have angered U.S. lawmakers. The vote came five days after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered senior Pentagon officials to begin monitoring major U.S. news media for disclosures of classified information in an effort to stop the release of government secrets. “Leaks of classified information regarding intelligence sources and methods can disrupt intelligence operations, threaten the lives of intelligence officers and assets, and make foreign partners less likely to work with us,” said Feinstein, a Democrat from California. “The culture of leaks has to change,” she said in a joint statement with Chambliss, a Georgia Republican. According to their statement, key provisions aimed at stemming leaks include requirement that the executive branch notify Congress when disclosing intelligence information to the public. The legislation restricts the number of intelligence community employees authorized to communicate with the media and prohibits current and former intelligence officials from signing certain contracts with media organizations. The bill, which requires passage by both chambers of Congress to become law, also requires the director of national intelligence to beef up its system for investigating leaks and to strengthen intelligence agencies non-disclosure agreements and penalties for unauthorized leaks. Chambliss called the leaks provision a “strong step toward stemming the torrent of leaks” and said it was negotiated with the House of Representatives. “I urge the administration to reject the status quo and work with Congress to pass these and any other needed changes into law,” he said. Attorney General Eric Holder appointed two chief federal prosecutors last month to spearhead an investigation into suspected leaks of classified information amid allegations the White House made the disclosures to boost President Barack Obama’s re-election chances. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Tuesday blamed the White House for leaks to the media about the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and cyber-warfare aimed at slowing Iran’s nuclear program. “This conduct is contemptible,” Romney said. “It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation, with explanation and consequence,” Romney told a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. "
2014-09-11,-8,"At least 22 people were killed during heavy fighting in Brazzaville last December between state security forces and gunmen loyal to Ntsourou, a former ally-turned-critic of President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Another 59 people were jailed for between five and 15 years after being convicted on charges of rebellion, murder and illegally stocking weapons.  The court acquitted 54 others, including Ntsourou’s wife. Ntsourou was earlier convicted for his role in a 2012 accident at an arms depot that killed nearly 300 people and led to sharp criticism of Sassou Nguesso’s administration. Ntsourou - who was convicted of involuntary responsibility for the blast, given a five-year suspended sentence and released - said he was being used as a scapegoat and has become a fierce critic of Sassou Nguesso, who has led Congo for most of the last 35 years.

2013-01-14,-1,"“We have made a commitment that al Qaeda is not going to find anyplace to hide,” U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters on his plane as he began a week-long tour of European capitals. Just as the United States pursued militants affiliated with al Qaeda to northern Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, “we have a responsibility to make sure that al Qaeda does not establish a base for operations in North Africa in Mali,” he said. France intervened in Mali on Friday in an effort to block an advance by rebels who the West fear could use the West African nation as a launching pad for international attacks. Paris has poured hundreds of troops into the Malian capital and carried out more air raids on Monday in the vast desert area seized last year by al Qaeda’s north African wing AQIM and Mali’s home-grown MUJWA and Ansar Dine militant groups. Panetta praised France for the steps it had taken and said he had been in talks with French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian about what assistance he needed. The Pentagon was looking at providing help in three areas, he added. “One is obviously to provide limited logistical support, two is to provide intelligence support and three to provide some airlift capability,” Panetta told the briefing on his plane. A senior U.S. defense official said the United States was already sharing information with the French and would continue to do so. Panetta declined to say whether the intelligence support would be in the form of satellite images or unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. He indicated the airlift support under discussion involved cargo planes and a defense official said the logistic support included tanker aircraft for aerial refueling. “We are engaged in those discussions. Africom (U.S. Africa Command) is discussing this with France and will continue to work with them to ensure that ultimately we do stop AQIM,” said Panetta, who received a briefing from the head of Africom, General Carter Ham, during his flight to Lisbon. “The responsibility for assuring security in that region will be passed to African nations to provide a more permanent security for the sake of the world,” he said. “While they might not have any immediate plans for attacks in the United States and Europe ... ultimately that still remains their objective and it’s for that reason that we have to take steps now to ensure that AQIM does not get that kind of traction,” Panetta said. His comments came at the outset of a trip that is likely to be his last as U.S. defense secretary and will take him to Lisbon, Madrid, Rome and London. Describing himself as a “son of Europe,” the Italian-American defense secretary said it was appropriate to finish his time in office with a visit to NATO partners, adding that he wanted to underscore the importance of the alliance to a new generation of Europeans. Panetta said he would brief his counterparts on talks last week between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. President Barack Obama. Karzai and Obama discussed the nature of the U.S. military presence, if any, in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of most combat troops at the end of 2014. They agreed that Afghan forces would take the lead role for security beginning this spring, in what was described as a slight acceleration of the mid-2013 transition timetable. Panetta, the first U.S. defense secretary to visit Portugal in 30 years, said he would discuss plans to reduce the U.S. military presence at Lajes Air Field in the Azores. "

2015-01-26,-11,"The commander of Unit 8200, named as Brigadier-General “A”, barred the 43 reserve soldiers who wrote to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top army chiefs in September, saying they could no longer serve in the unit, the radio said. Coming a few weeks after Israel’s 50-day war against Islamist militants in the Gaza Strip, the letter was seen as an unprecedented rebuke of Netanyahu’s security policies but the military dismissed it as a publicity stunt by a small fringe. By decrying the sweep of eavesdropping on Palestinians, and the role such espionage plays in setting up air strikes that have often inflicted civilian casualties, the move opened a window on clandestine practices. “We refuse to take part in actions against Palestinians and refuse to continue serving as a tool for deepening military rule in the occupied (Palestinian) territories,” the Yedioth Ahronoth daily quoted the letter as saying. No signatories’ names were published, in apparent keeping with their non-disclosure commitments to Unit 8200, which monitors enemy Arab states and Iran as well as the Palestinians. Several were interviewed anonymously in the Israeli media, however, and complained about what they described as the gathering of Palestinians’ private information - for example, sexual preferences or health problems “that might be used to extort people into becoming informants”. Channel 1 TV quoted from Unit 8200 commander’s dismissal letter: “You have crossed a red line and acted inappropriately and in light of what you have written, we part company with you.” "
2014-07-26,-12,"At least 1,050 Gazans - mostly civilians - have been killed, and 42 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel have died. Flynn disparaged Hamas for exhausting finite resources and know-how to build tunnels that have helped them inflict record casualties on Israelis. Still, he suggested that destroying Hamas was not the answer. “If Hamas were destroyed and gone, we would probably end up with something much worse. The region would end up with something much worse,” Flynn said at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.  “A worse threat that would come into the sort of ecosystem there … something like ISIS,” he added, referring to the Islamic State, which last month declared an “Islamic caliphate” in territory it controls in Iraq and Syria. Confined in the crowded, sandy coast enclave of 1.8 million, where poverty and unemployment hover around 40 percent, weary Gazans say they hope the battle will break the blockade that Israel and Egypt impose on them.  Israeli officials said any ceasefire must allow the military to carry on hunting down the Hamas tunnel network that criss-crosses the Gaza border. Flynn’s comments about the conflict came during a gloomy, broader assessment of unrest across the Middle East, including in Syria and Iraq. Flynn said bluntly: “Is there going to be a peace in the Middle East? Not in my lifetime.” "
2013-11-03,-14,"In “A Manifesto for the Truth” published in German news magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday, Snowden said current debates about mass surveillance in many countries showed his revelations were helping to bring about change. “Instead of causing damage, the usefulness of the new public knowledge for society is now clear because reforms to politics, supervision and laws are being suggested,” the 30-year-old ex-CIA employee and NSA contractor wrote. “Citizens have to fight against the suppression of information about affairs of essential importance for the public. Those who speak the truth are not committing a crime.” Snowden is in Russia, where he has been given asylum for at least a year. In an open letter to Germany last week, Snowden said he was counting on international support to stop Washington’s ‘persecution’ of him. His revelations about the reach and methods of the NSA, including the monitoring of vast volumes of Internet traffic and phone records, have angered U.S. allies from Germany to Brazil. Admirers have called Snowden a human rights champion. Others say he is a traitor for stealing information from the NSA after vowing to respect its secrecy policies and then fleeing first to Hong Kong and then to Russia with classified U.S. data. Snowden declined a job offer from Russia’s top social networking site VKontakte (InTouch), local media quoted one of the company’s founders, Pavel Durov, as saying over the weekend. A Russian lawyer with close links to the authorities who is assisting Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, had said this week the American would start work in November for a “large Russian (web)site” that he refused to name for security reasons. In the manifesto published on Sunday, Snowden said mass surveillance was a global problem that needed global solutions and added that secret services’ “criminal surveillance programs” jeopardized individual privacy, freedom of opinion and open societies. The existence of spying technology should not determine politics, he said: “We have a moral duty to ensure that our laws and values limit surveillance programs and protect human rights”. Society, said Snowden, could only understand and keep a check on these problems via an open, ruthless and informed debate. He said some governments that felt exposed by the revelations had at first launched a “persecution campaign” to repress debate by intimidating journalists and threatening them with prosecution. “At that time the public was not in a position to judge the usefulness of these revelations. People trusted that their governments would make the right decisions,” he said. “Today we know that was a mistake and that such behavior does not serve the public interest,” he said. "
2014-04-25,-24,"Syria denies it maintains the capacity to deploy chemical weapons, calling the allegation a U.S. and European attempt to use their “childish” policies to blackmail Assad’s government. But in a tacit acknowledgement of the original declaration’s incompleteness, Syria earlier this month submitted a more specific list of its chemical weapons to the international disarmament mission after discrepancies were reported by inspectors on the ground, officials said. Under threat of U.S. airstrikes, Assad agreed with the United States and Russia in September to dispose of his chemical weapons - an arsenal that Damascus had never previously formally acknowledged - after hundreds of people were killed in a sarin gas attack in August on the outskirts of the capital. Washington and its Western allies said it was Assad’s forces who unleashed the sarin attack, the world’s worst chemical attack in a quarter-century. The government blamed the rebel side in Syria’s civil war, which is now in its fourth year. The verification of Syria’s declaration on its poison gas arsenal and its destruction has been overseen by a joint team of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the global chemical arms watchdog. Diplomats say Western governments have long suspected Syria did not declare all aspects of its chemical arms program. But the envoys say they have kept silent on the issue to avoid giving Assad an excuse to curtail cooperation with the U.N.-OPCW mission and slow down an already delayed timetable for shipping toxins out of the country. With more than 90 percent of Syria’s declared chemical stockpiles now out of the country, Western officials have started to break their silence. “We are convinced, and we have some intelligence showing, that they have not declared everything,” a senior Western diplomat told Reuters, adding that the intelligence had come from Britain, France and the United States. When asked how much of its program Syria has kept hidden, the diplomat said: “It’s substantial.” He offered no details. “These countries aren’t really reliable and their policies towards the implementation of the agreement between the Syrian government and the OPCW aren’t principled but rather childish,” he said in a mobile-phone text message to Reuters. “If they have some evidence they must share it with the OPCW rather than pretending to have secret evidence!” Ja‘afari said the three Western powers’ goal was to needlessly extend the U.N.-OPCW mission by “keeping the ‘chemical file’ open indefinitely so that they can keep exerting pressure and blackmailing the Syrian government.” Another Western official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that while there was not 100 percent certainty Syria maintains chemical weapons, the three Western powers agreed that there is a “high level of probability” that Syria deliberately under-reported the full extent of its chemical arms-related stockpiles. He cited examples of large batch of a sarin precursor chemical going missing in Syria and Damascus’ unverified claims to have destroyed most of its mustard gas stocks before the U.N.-OPCW mission arrived in the country and other anomalies. In interviews over the last two months with Western officials with access to intelligence about Syria, Reuters learned that topics of concern include deadly nerve agent ricin, mustard gas, precursor chemicals used to make sarin, and, more recently, the use of chlorine gas in Syria. U.S. and British officials have also spoken of ambiguities and problems with the Syrian chemical weapons declaration. U.S. officials warned as early as November that intelligence suggested Syria may try to hide some toxins. Suspicions that its declaration was incomplete deepened when Syria did not report to the OPCW having sarin, which was used in the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, or the type of rockets used to deliver an estimated 300 liters of the toxin. The senior Western diplomat said Britain, France and the United States had provided information to the OPCW months ago, including on specific undeclared chemical weapons sites. He added that the three powers had also provided Assad’s staunch ally Russia with the intelligence but “they have not reacted.” The OPCW had no immediate comment when queried. A Russian U.N. mission spokesman said he had no comment, though Moscow reiterated on Friday its position that claims about the Syrian government using chemicals weapons were false. "
2012-08-19,-3,"Germany’s Bild am Sonntag said the boat had spying equipment from the German intelligence service on board, enabling it to observe Syrian troop movements up to 600 km (375 miles) inland. Information on the military operations of President Bashar al-Assad’s troops that is collected by the ship is passed on to U.S. and British secret services, who then give it to the Free Syrian Army, Bild said. A spokesman for the German Defence Ministry said a German navy ship equipped with telecommunications and reconnaissance technology that normally patrols the international waters of the eastern Mediterranean was in a harbour in Sardinia. Ships of this type are used to collect information but the ministry would not comment on details, he said. A German government spokesman said the government did not comment on intelligence service activities. The German intelligence service declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office declined to comment. She reiterated that Britain was giving non-lethal support to Syria’s opposition. No one was immediately available for comment at the U.S. State Department. Bild also said German intelligence service agents were stationed at a NATO base in the Turkish city of Adana, where they were intercepting telephone calls and radio communications from Syria. They are also maintaining informal contact with sources close to Assad’s government, the paper said. Assad is battling a 17-month uprising against 42 years of rule by his family, and Syria’s civil war has intensified since a July bombing killed members of Assad’s inner circle including his defence minister and brother-in-law. "
2012-07-25,-10,"The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, passed the Democratic Party-controlled committee by a 14-1 vote on Tuesday, Chairman Dianne Feinstein and Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss said in a statement. Media reports in recent months based on high-profile leaks about U.S. cyber-warfare against Iran, procedures for targeting militants with drones and a double agent who penetrated a militant group in Yemen have angered U.S. lawmakers. The vote came five days after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered senior Pentagon officials to begin monitoring major U.S. news media for disclosures of classified information in an effort to stop the release of government secrets. “Leaks of classified information regarding intelligence sources and methods can disrupt intelligence operations, threaten the lives of intelligence officers and assets, and make foreign partners less likely to work with us,” said Feinstein, a Democrat from California. “The culture of leaks has to change,” she said in a joint  statement with Chambliss, a Georgia Republican. According to their statement, key provisions aimed at stemming leaks include requirement that the executive branch notify Congress when disclosing intelligence information to the public. The legislation restricts the number of intelligence community employees authorized to communicate with the media and prohibits current and former intelligence officials from signing certain contracts with media organizations. The bill, which requires passage by both chambers of Congress to become law, also requires the director of national intelligence to beef up its system for investigating leaks and to strengthen intelligence agencies non-disclosure agreements and penalties for unauthorized leaks. Chambliss called the leaks provision a “strong step toward stemming the torrent of leaks” and said it was negotiated with the House of Representatives. “I urge the administration to reject the status quo and work with Congress to pass these and any other needed changes into law,” he said. Attorney General Eric Holder appointed two chief federal prosecutors last month to spearhead an investigation into suspected leaks of classified information amid allegations the White House made the disclosures to boost President Barack Obama’s re-election chances. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Tuesday blamed the White House for leaks to the media about the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and cyber-warfare aimed at slowing Iran’s nuclear program. “This conduct is contemptible,” Romney said. “It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation, with explanation and consequence,” Romney told a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

2015-01-16,-6,"NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Jim Chanos, founder of hedge fund firm Kynikos Associates, said on Friday he is betting against the shares of chipmaker Intel Corp. “We’re short Intel,” Chanos told cable television network CNBC. Chanos said he has been shorting, or betting against the company’s shares, for the past six months. Chanos, who has been critical of the personal computer sector and has bet against companies such as International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co, said Intel has “the same challenges.” Intel said Thursday that revenues from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter to $8.9 billion. That raised doubts about a long-anticipated recovery of the PC business. The company also forecast first-quarter revenues of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, below the 65.4 percent reported in the fourth quarter.

2014-11-04,-2,"By Sarah McBride HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Nov 4 (Reuters) - If Shubham Banerjee cannot lay claim to being the world’s youngest venture capital-backed entrepreneur, he comes very close. Banerjee was 12 years old when he closed an early-stage funding round with Intel Capital, the company’s venture capital arm, last month for his prototype for a low-cost Braille printer. Since then, the San Jose, California middle-schooler has turned 13. That’s young, even by the standards of Silicon Valley, where many venture capitalists unapologetically prefer to fund youth over experience. Young entrepreneurs usually have reached at least their mid-teens when they hit it big. Nick D‘Aloisio, founder of online news aggregator Summly, was 17 when Yahoo bought his company last year for $30 million. Brothers John and Patrick Collison, behind payments service Stripe, were 16 and 19 when they sold an earlier business to a Canadian company for $5 million. After reading a fundraising flyer about the blind, Banerjee felt inspired to turn a high-tech version of Legos, the toy building blocks, into a device that could print in Braille. One day, he wants to mass-produce the printers and sell them for about $350, far less than Braille printers cost now. This past summer, he worked on incorporating an Intel Edison chip, a processor aimed at hobbyists, into the printer. In September, Intel invited him to a conference in India to highlight uses for Edison. There, he got a big surprise. Intel executive Mike Bell announced from the conference stage that the giant chipmaker would invest in his company, Braigo Labs. Until then, his funding consisted of the $35,000 his parents gave him. “I turned back to my dad, and said, ‘What did he just say?'” Banerjee recalled. “I was all over the place.” Banerjee and a spokesman for Intel Capital declined to disclose the size of the investment. A person familiar with the matter said it was a few hundred thousand dollars. He plans to use it to build a better prototype of the printer and test it with more groups for the blind. After the announcement, Banerjee had to bone up on unfamiliar terms such as “venture capital.” He also needed to convince adults to co-sign his funding and patent documents. Among the company officials he turned to: Braigo’s president, his mom, Malini. Banerjee says he gets mostly As and Bs as a student at the Champion School in San Jose, California. Teachers have given him time off to attend events like the conference in India and the Intel Global Capital summit this week in Huntington Beach, California. He catches up on school work on weekends, he says. This is the second Intel investment connected to the Banerjee family. His dad, Neil, works for Kno, an education start-up that Intel bought last year. While many young entrepreneurs who win venture-capital cash end up ditching their education to focus on their businesses full time, Banerjee says he won’t take that path. “It’s an after-school thing,” he says.

Chesapeake Energy Corp dropped 5.5 percent to $18.06 and was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company’s oil and natural gas wells. The stock fell as low as $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp were among the biggest drags on the Dow. IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. IBM shares slipped 3.5 percent to $200.13 while Intel shares fell 1.8 percent to $27.95. The PHLX semiconductor index dropped 0.9 percent. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has so far been a strong earnings season. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 had its best day in a month as Coca-Cola Co led the day’s round of solid earnings and concerns eased over the euro zone’s debt crisis. “Both Intel and IBM have led to some profit-taking today, with both companies posting decent reports, but disappointing investors for different reasons,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “If you want to be an optimist, you could point to the fact that the market didn’t sell off all that much, given the solid advance we saw yesterday.” The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 82.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to 13,032.75 at the close. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 5.64 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,385.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 11.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 3,031.45. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist of Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, Tennessee, expects the market to continue its back-and-forth moves, possibly trending lower in the second quarter after strong gains earlier in the year. “A consolidation or correction phase in the second quarter would make the most sense, and probably it would be the most healthy thing for the market,” he said. Among other declining shares, Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Class B shares dropped 1.3 percent to $79.74 a day after CEO Warren Buffett said he has cancer. On Tuesday, Buffett said that he has Stage 1 prostate cancer that “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” A bright spot in the tech space, Yahoo Inc shares gained 3.2 percent to $15.49, a day after reporting that quarterly revenues rose - marking Yahoo’s first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company. Eighty percent of S&P 500 companies are beating earnings estimates so far, with results in from 66 companies. Other advancers included Halliburton Co, up 4.6 percent at $34.17, after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company said North American revenue reached a record high. In contrast, shares of Genworth Financial Inc slid 23.8 percent to $5.87 after the life and mortgage insurer pushed back the initial public offering of an Australian unit."

Last month, ASML’s chief executive Eric Meurice said he had asked its three biggest customers - Intel Corp., TSMC, and Samsung Electronics - to help fund its costly R&D and invest in up to 25 percent of its shares. ASML said on Sunday TSMC agreed to invest 276 million euros in research over the coming five years and will also take a 5 percent equity stake in ASML, valued at 838 million euros. ASML cut a similar deal with Intel Corp. in July and said then that it expected to reach agreements with TSMC and Samsung Electronics to accelerate the development of its “extreme ultraviolet” or EUV lithography technology and 450-millimeter lithography tools. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon , but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. When ASML announced its first customer deal with Intel on July 9th, Intel said it hoped the R&D investment boost would help speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. At the time, some analysts said paying $50 for a tablet computer is not beyond the realm of possibility. “One of the biggest challenges facing IC scaling today is how to effectively control the escalating wafer manufacturing cost,” said Shang-yi Chiang, TSMC executive vice president and co-chief operating officer, who added that is he confident the programme with ASML will speed up the development of new technologies. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and EUV lithography. “The objective of the Co-Investment programme is to secure and accelerate key lithography technologies. These technologies will benefit the entire industry and are not restricted to our Co-Investment partners,” said Meurice. A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months."
2012-04-18,-9,"* Chesapeake Energy shares drop after report * Dow off 0.6 pct, S&P down 0.4 pct, Nasdaq off 0.4 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street’s best gains in a month, as uninspiring earnings from tech bellwethers IBM and Intel  gave investors a reason to take profits. Chesapeake Energy Corp dropped 5.5 percent to $18.06 and was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company’s oil and natural gas wells. The stock fell as low as $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp ranked among the biggest drags on the Dow. IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. IBM shares slipped 3.5 percent to $200.13 while Intel shares fell 1.8 percent to $27.95. The PHLX semiconductor index dropped 0.9 percent. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has so far been a strong earnings season. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 had its best day in a month as Coca-Cola Co led the day’s round of solid earnings and concerns eased over the euro zone’s debt crisis. Tuesday’s rally also gave both the Dow and the Nasdaq their biggest one-day percentage gains since March 13. “Both Intel and IBM have led to some profit-taking today, with both companies posting decent reports, but disappointing investors for different reasons,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “If you want to be an optimist, you could point to the fact that the market didn’t sell off all that much, given the solid advance we saw yesterday.” The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 82.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 13,032.75. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 5.64 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,385.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 11.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 3,031.45. After the closing bell, shares of Qualcomm fell 3.3 percent to $64.77 as the chipmaker provided a disappointing quarterly and full-year outlook. In contrast, shares of eBay shot up 7.6 percent to $38.60 in extended-hours trading following the release of its results, which topped expectations. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist of Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, Tennessee, expects the market to continue its back-and-forth moves, possibly trending lower in the second quarter after strong gains earlier in the year. “A consolidation or correction phase in the second quarter would make the most sense, and probably it would be the most healthy thing for the market,” he said. In the regular session, among other declining stocks were Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Class B shares, which dropped 1.3 percent to $79.74 a day after CEO Warren Buffett said he has cancer. On Tuesday, Buffett said that he has Stage 1 prostate cancer that “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” A bright spot in the tech space, Yahoo Inc shares gained 3.2 percent to $15.49, a day after reporting that quarterly revenues rose - marking Yahoo’s first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company. Eighty percent of S&P 500 companies are beating earnings estimates so far, with results in from 66 companies. Other advancers included Halliburton Co, up 4.6 percent at $34.17, after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company said North American revenue reached a record high. In contrast, shares of Genworth Financial Inc slid 23.8 percent to $5.87 after the life and mortgage insurer pushed back the initial public offering of an Australian unit. Volume was lighter than average, with about 5.95 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below this year’s daily average of 6.67 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 2 to 1, and on the Nasdaq, by about 17 to 7."
2012-10-17,-10,"* Intel and IBM slump after results, weigh on Dow * Bank of America shares volatile in heavy trading * Dow down 0.3 pct, S&P up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq off 0.2 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday, putting the benchmark index on track for its third straight day of gains, as U.S. housing starts hit a four-year high, but weak results from tech bellwethers curbed the Dow. Homebuilders’ shares climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008 - in a sign that the housing sector’s budding recovery is supporting the broader economy. But both Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp tumbled a day after they reported results, keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone caused a drag of nearly 88 points on the blue-chip average. Intel also pulled on the Nasdaq 100 The S&P technology sector index lost 1 percent. Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel dropped 3.1 percent to $21.65 while IBM lost 5.8 percent to $198.73. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Intel also weighed on the Nasdaq. Bank of America shares slipped 0.5 percent to $9.41 after the second-largest U.S. bank said earnings per share were break-even and down sharply from the year-ago period. Shares of M&T Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.22 after the company posted third-quarter results, helping push the KBW Bank index up 1.1 percent. Financial companies’ earnings have yielded mixed results so far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the financial sector, though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo. Earnings “expectations were extremely conservative, and the results are just not that bad at all. And whenever people begin to get too far in one direction - meaning earnings are going to be terrible - generally reality is better than that, and we are seeing that now,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22 points, or 0.25 percent, to 13,518.56. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.25 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,457.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 4.83 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,096.34. After the U.S. Commerce Department’s report on housing starts, the PHLX housing index rose 2.5 percent. The index got a lift from P u lteGroup Inc, up 5.4 percent at $17.46. “They were very good numbers. It does seem to us that the housing market really has bottomed. It’s not going to roar higher, but that is a good thing,” Ghriskey said. The S&P 500 achieved its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent through Tuesday’s close, on the heels of last week’s drop - its worst weekly decline in four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted the last week’s slide, have been tempered this week as more companies post quarterly results. According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning, quarterly earnings for S&P 500 components are now expected to fall 1.7 percent from a year ago. With 14 percent of S&P companies having reported results so far, 64 percent have beaten Wall Street’s earnings expectations - less than the 67 percent average for the past four quarters. Apollo Group Inc shares plummeted 20 percent to $21.99 as the S&P 500’s biggest decliner a day after the company, the owner of the largest for-profit college in the United States, gave a weak 2013 outlook. ASML, the world’s leading chip gear maker, agreed to buy Cymer - its key supplier of a light-based technology crucial to making a new generation of much smaller and smarter chips - for $2.5 billion. Cymer surged 46.7 percent to $70.17. In contrast, the U.S.-listed shares of ASML  dropped 8.8 percent to $48.87."

2014-11-20,11,"* U.S. data show further evidence of economic growth * Best Buy gains after earnings * Indexes: Dow up 0.2 pct, S&P up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq up 0.6 pct   (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 finished at record highs on Thursday as data showed further strength in the U.S. economy and Intel gave an upbeat forecast. Tech shares gave the market its biggest lift, along with energy. Boosting all three major indexes, Intel shares jumped 4.7 percent to $35.95, hitting their highest level since January 2002, after its 2015 revenue outlook was above Wall Street’s expectations and the company raised its dividend. The S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, while the energy index gained 1.1 percent. Further supporting stocks, data showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region grew at its fastest pace in two decades, U.S. home resales jumped to their highest in more than a year in October, and a gauge of future U.S. economic activity gained. Growth in the economy and earnings should bode well for stocks heading into next year, said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. “Next year will be a reasonable to maybe a surprisingly good year,” she said. “(There is) no reason in the world why we can’t see P/Es expand.” Patel said stocks could rise by a mid single-digit to high-teens percentage next year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.27 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,719, a record close. The S&P 500  gained 4.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,052.75, its 44th record high this year. The Nasdaq Composite added 26.16 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,701.87. The Philadelphia Fed area “isn’t a hub of industrial activity anymore but it’s still important and it’s strong,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. The upbeat U.S. data offset weakness overseas, including euro zone business growth that was slower than expected this month. Best Buy added 7 percent to $38.02, among the S&P’s largest percentage gainers, after better-than-expected profit. Among the top Nasdaq decliners was Keurig Green Mountain , down 7.4 percent at $142.50, a day after it forecast fiscal first-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates. After the bell, Gap shares fell 4.9 percent to $38.19 following its results. Gap shares ended the regular session up 1.5 percent. About 5.7 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared below 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,013 to 1,025, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,824 issues rose and 893 fell for a 2.04-to-1 ratio.

2013-01-18,1,"* Weak outlook weighs on Intel, down 6 pct * China economic growth beats expectations * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P down 0.1 pct, Nasdaq down 0.2 pct By Leah Schnurr NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened little changed on Friday, a day after the S&P 500 rose to its highest level in five years, as a weak outlook from Intel offset a fourth-quarter profit at Morgan Stanley. Shares of Intel Corp slumped 6.1 percent to $21.30 after the tech company forecast quarterly revenue that was below analysts’ estimates and hiked capital spending plans for the year. That was offset somewhat by a 5-percent gain in shares of Morgan Stanley, which reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock jumped 5.3 percent to $22.84. The earnings season so far has been mixed, but that could change with a barrage of releases scheduled for next week, said Doug Cote, chief market strategist, ING Investment Management in New York. “There were some good reports but the real big bellwether companies are not coming in strong,” said Cote. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 8.02 points, or 0.06 percent, at 13,604.04. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.20 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,479.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 7.52 points, or 0.24 percent, to 3,128.48. Overall, S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have risen 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed. Expectations for the quarter have dropped considerably since October, when a 9.9 percent gain was estimated. On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose to its highest since late 2007, and that could prompt investors to lock in recent gains, analysts said. Economic data out of China provided some support to the market, though the focus remained on U.S. corporate earnings. The country’s economy grew at a modestly faster-than-expected 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the latest sign the world’s second-biggest economy was pulling out of a post-global financial crisis slowdown which saw it grow in 2012 at its weakest pace since 1999. General Electric reported a better-than-expected rise in earnings on Friday, spurred by robust demand in China and oil-producing countries. Shares were up 2.4 percent to $21.82. Despite the gains in Morgan Stanley, financial stocks sagged as Capital One Financial reported disappointing profit. Capital One slumped 7.4 percent to $57.06, while the KBW bank index slipped 0.4 percent. Research In Motion  climbed 4.7 percent to $15.61 after Jefferies Group boosted the BlackBerry maker’s rating and price target."

Homebuilders climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008 and a sign the housing sector was supporting the  economy.

Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel dropped 2.7 percent to $21.75 while IBM lost 4.3 percent to $201.85. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and Nasdaq. Bank of America swung between small losses and small gains in heavy, volatile trading after it said per-share earnings were break-even and down sharply compared with the previous year. But M&T Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.27 after posting third-quarter results, helping to lift the KBW Bank index 1.2 percent. Earnings among financial stocks have yielded mixed results thus far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the group, though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase  and Wells Fargo. “It seems like it’s a classic earnings period reaction. Either people are too exuberant and expectations are raised too high to beat when the actual number comes out or people are too pessimistic and the earnings are just not as low,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New York. After the housing starts report the PHLX housing index  rose 3.5 percent, led by a 4.9 percent climb in DR Horton Inc to $21.69. “The housing number gave people some confidence that maybe we are moving in the right direction economically, so it’s one of those days where the glass seems half full more than half empty.” said Meckler. The S&P just notched its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent, on the heels of its worst weekly decline in four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted the decline, have been dampened this week as more companies post quarterly results. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.98 points, or 0.09 percent, to 13,539.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.14 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,459.06.

Shares of Intel Corp slid 3.5 percent to $25.60 and weighed on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes a day after the chipmaker’s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations by a penny due to weak spending on servers. Intel gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. General Electric Co shares dropped 2.6 percent to $26.49. The conglomerate reported a slightly better-than-expected increase in revenue on Friday, propelled by its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines. Bucking the session’s slight downtrend was American Express Co, which reported quarterly results late on Thursday. Its strong numbers also boosted its peer Visa. Both were the top gainers in the Dow Jones industrial average, which outperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. AmEx shares jumped 4.7 percent to $91.88. Visa gained 3.2 percent to $228.80. As earnings continue to trickle in, analysts expect the market to get more clarity on the strength of Corporate America and look for leadership to define the next move. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Morgan Stanley rose 4.3 percent to $33.38 after previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to 16,478.33. The S&P 500 fell 3.17 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,842.72. The Nasdaq Composite  declined 13.82 points, or 0.33 percent, to 4,204.87 After the S&P 500’s 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday. For the year, the S&P 500 is down about 0.3 percent. The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs. Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Monthly housing starts posted their largest percentage decline since April, but were coming off a six-year high reached in November, and the decline was smaller than economists had expected. The PHLX housing sector index lost 1.2 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the consumer sentiment index slipped to 80.4 from 82.5 in December, weighed by lowered expectations among lower- and middle-income families. The Dow Jones Transportation Average dipped 0.2 percent, dragged down by a 1.1 percent drop in UPS Inc  to $99.34 and a 2.5 percent decline in Con-Way to $40.37 after fourth-quarter outlooks.

2015-03-12,-12,"* Bank stocks higher after Fed stress tests * Weekly jobless claims fall; retail sales disappoint * Intel shares fall after lowered outlook * Indexes up: Dow 1 pct, S&P 0.9 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pct   (Updates to afternoon trading) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, with banking stocks among the biggest gainers of the day, though tech shares were pressured by a weak outlook from Intel. Nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors were higher on the day, though the rally only represented a partial rebound off a recent bout of weakness, which took the S&P 500 down in eight of the past 11 sessions, and off 3 percent over the past four sessions alone. The weakness has largely been driven by concerns the Fed could raise rates as early as June. Last week’s strong payroll report solidified this view as the central bank said it would begin raising rates when it deemed the economy strong enough. In the latest data, jobless claims fell far more than expected in the latest week, supporting the theory that the labor market is rapidly strengthening. Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February. “I’ve been a believer in a June rate hike for a while, but the odds really went up on Friday, and the market action we’ve seen since then is in line with the volatility we’ve historically seen around rate hikes,” said James Liu, global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. The S&P financial sector rose 1.4 percent as one of the biggest gainers on the day in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s annual check-up on the industry’s health. Citigroup passed, allowing it to raise payouts and sending shares up 3.1 percent to $53.96. Bank of America  was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares fell 0.7 percent to $16. Intel Corp slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.  Shares of the Dow component fell 4.2 percent to $30.96 and limited the Nasdaq’s advance. Crude oil fell 1.4 percent to $47.51, continuing a recent spate of volatility. Weakness in the commodity pressured energy stocks, which fell slightly as the only declining industry group on the day. Lumber Liquidators rose 12 percent to $36.79 in volatile trading.

Coke and J&J, both Dow components, climbed after their results while recent outperformers fell, a sign that investors were rotating from growth stocks into value ones. In recent weeks, high-growth stocks  have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared unsustainable. The three major U.S. stock indexes fell for much of the session before rebounding in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq moved in a 108.77-point range, and at its lows of the day, it was within 0.3 percent of 3,934.53, the level that represents a 10 percent drop from its recent intraday peak, hit on March 6. “The market is trying to stabilize, and investors are looking for high-quality names that have stability in their earnings and prices,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “This afternoon’s move is part of that same flight to quality.” Coca-Cola Co jumped 3.7 percent to $40.18 as one of the S&P 500’s biggest gainers after the world’s largest beverage maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by strong sales in China. Johnson & Johnson rose 2.1 percent to $99.20 after the pharmaceuticals and consumer products company posted earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit view. Among the most active “momentum” names, shares of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc fell 2.1 percent to $193.91 and shares of online movie rental company Netflix Inc  dropped 1.6 percent to $326.27. Intuitive Surgical  shares fell 1.9 percent to $417.09. “We’re going through a period of rolling corrections, which will consolidate the high-growth names that did so great last year,” said Hayes Miller, head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management in Boston. “I don’t read anything systemic into the action, as seen by the gains in more defensive areas. The losses should remain contained.” After the closing bell, Intel Corp shares rose 3 percent to $27.56 in extended-hours trading after the chipmaker reported its first-quarter results and gave an outlook.  Yahoo Inc shares rose 1.4 percent to $34.70 after the bell following the company’s results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.32 points, or 0.55 percent, to end at 16,262.56. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 12.37 points, or 0.68 percent, to finish at 1,842.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 11.47 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 4,034.16. In the latest economic snapshot, a gauge of manufacturing in New York state grew at a much slower rate in April than it did in March, coming in far below expectations. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent in March as food and housing rental costs rose, although inflation pressures remained generally benign. S&P 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Twitter Inc shares surged 11.4 percent to close at $45.52 after the company said it bought social data provider Gnip for an undisclosed amount. Aaron’s Inc shares tumbled 4 percent to end at $29.25 after the rent-to-own furniture and electronics retailer said it had rejected a $2.3 billion takeover offer from a major shareholder and instead acquired a retail credit financing firm for about $700 million. Barcode printer maker Zebra Technologies said it would buy Motorola Solutions Inc’s enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners, for $3.45 billion in cash. Motorola Solutions shares declined 0.6 percent to end at $63.37. Zebra shares tumbled 10.1 percent to close at $61.39. About 58 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher for the day, while about 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended lower. About 7.62 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, above the month-to-date average of 6.87 billion.       (Editing by Jan Paschal)"
2014-01-17,-12,"* American Express and Visa lead the Dow’s gainers * Morgan Stanley stock hits highest since 2009 after results * Dow up 0.3 pct, S&P 500 off 0.4 pct, Nasdaq down 0.5 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined on Friday as results from Intel and General Electric  were the latest to dampen the view on fourth-quarter earnings. Volatility picked up late in the session, thanks in part to selling related to options expiration, analysts said. Earnings season is still in the early phase, but S&P 500 companies so far are beating analysts’ expectations at a rate that’s below what’s typical, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bucking the trend, the Dow ended higher - helped by a rally in American Express Co and Visa. AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel’s stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny. General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins. But at least some of the day’s move could have been options related. “January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today’s an example of that,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston. “Money managers typically take their most aggressive picks during the first part of the year, and a lot of options strategies are involved in those picks.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.55 points or 0.25 percent, to end at 16,458.56. The S&P 500 fell 7.19 points or 0.39 percent, to finish at 1,838.70. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.107 points or 0.50 percent, to 4,197.582. For the week, the Dow rose 0.13 percent, the S&P 500 slipped 0.20 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.55 percent. With earnings from 10 percent of the S&P 500 companies so far, 50 percent have exceeded expectations, below the historical average of 63 percent for a full season, Thomson Reuters data showed. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Visa shares jumped 4.7 percent to close at $232.18. A U.S. appeals judge appeared to side with the Federal Reserve over a group of retailers in a dispute over the level of fees set by the Fed on the use of debit cards. Among other gainers, Morgan Stanley rose 4.4 percent to $33.40 after previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank fell 3 percent to $52.27 after a Wall Street Journal report that the largest German bank is considering a profit warning as executives believe its upcoming quarterly results will be below investors’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average slipped 0.4 percent. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc fell 0.6 percent to $99.91 and the stock of Con-Way dropped 2 percent to $40.59 after fourth-quarter outlooks. After the S&P 500’s 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday. The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs. Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Volume was above the average for the month. About 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the average of 6.6 billion so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 3 to 2. On the Nasdaq, about 15 stocks fell for every 11 that rose."
2013-01-17,3,"* EBay gains after results beat expectations * Bank of America, Citigroup results weigh on financials * Dow up 0.6 pct, S&P 500 up 0.6 pct, Nasdaq up 0.6 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected data on U.S. housing starts and jobless claims lit a fire under stocks on Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 to a five-year high and its third day of gains. A pair of economic reports lifted investors’ sentiment. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low last week and housing starts jumped last month to the highest since June 2008. Strength in the housing and labor markets is key to sustained growth and higher corporate profits, helping to bring out buyers even on a day when earnings reports were mixed. Gains were tempered by weakness in the financial sector, with Bank of America down 4.2 percent to $11.28 and Citigroup off 2.9 percent to $41.24 after their results. In other negative earnings news, shares of chipmaker Intel  fell 5.2 percent to $21.49 in extended-hours trading after the company forecast quarterly revenue that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Intel had ended the regular session up 2.6 percent at $22.68. The S&P 500 ended at its highest since December 2007 and now sits just 5.6 percent from its all-time closing high of 1,565.15. “Having consolidated really for the last two weeks, the fact that we broke out, I think that that is sucking in quite a bit of money,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 84.79 points, or 0.63 percent, at 13,596.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 8.31 points, or 0.56 percent, at 1,480.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 18.46 points, or 0.59 percent, at 3,136.00. Better-than-expected earnings and revenue reported by online marketplace eBay late Wednesday helped the stock gain 2.7 percent to $54.33. In the housing sector, PulteGroup Inc shares gained 4.9 percent to $20.29 and Toll Brothers Inc advanced 3.1 percent to $35.99. The PHLX housing sector index climbed 2.4 percent, reaching its highest close since August 2007. Semiconductor shares rose 2 percent to the highest close in eight months. Financials were the only S&P 500 sector to register a slight decline for the day. Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit fell as it took more charges to clean up mortgage-related problems. Citigroup posted $2.32 billion of charges for layoffs and lawsuits. Energy shares led gains on the Dow as U.S. crude oil prices jumped more than 1 percent. Shares of Exxon Mobil were up 0.8 percent at $90.20 while shares of Chevron were up 0.7 percent at $114.75. S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed. Expectations for the quarter have fallen considerably since October when a 9.9 percent gain was estimated. Volume was roughly 6.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, compared with the 2012 average daily closing volume of about 6.45 billion. Advancers outpaced decliners on the NYSE by about 22 to 7 and on the Nasdaq by about 2 to 1."
2014-05-23,-20,"By Jonathan Stempel May 23 (Reuters) - Four major Silicon Valley companies have formally agreed to pay $324.5 million to settle claims brought by employees who accused them of limiting competition by colluding not to poach each other’s talent. The settlement, between Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp, Adobe Systems Inc and roughly 64,000 workers, was disclosed in papers filed late on Thursday with a federal court in San Jose, California. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily. The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff. The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates. Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. Thursday’s settlement gives workers only a few thousand dollars each on average. The companies’ combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple. In court papers, two law firms representing the plaintiffs said Devine’s objection should not doom what they consider a fair and reasonable settlement for an antitrust case, and which serves the best interests of the class. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought. “The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,” Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial. Based on that, I think the settlement is a significant achievement.” Devine did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment. Koh on May 16 approved separate settlements totaling $20 million over alleged poaching by Walt Disney Co’s  Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and by Intuit Inc. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-02509.

2013-07-18,-15,"* Intel cuts 2013 revenue f‘cast, capex * European index futures signal weaker open * China shares down on financing concerns By Dominic Lau TOKYO, July 18 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday, as concerns over financing available to property developers hurt Chinese markets, although overall sentiment was supported by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s pledge to keep monetary policy easy for the foreseeable future. Regional tech-related stocks were hit by U.S. Intel Corp’s  dismal annual revenue forecast and capital spending cuts, rooted in softer personal computer sales and weakness in China, one of its biggest markets. The dollar extended modest overnight gains after Bernanke stuck to a timeline that he first outlined in June to wind down the Federal Reserve’s $85 billion a month bond-buying programme, but he went out of his way to stress that nothing was set in stone. European stock futures eased 0.4 percent, indicating a weaker open, while U.S. S&P 500 index futures  slipped 0.2 percent ahead of quarterly results from Google, Microsoft and Morgan Stanley, and a weekly jobless claims report. China’s CSI300 share index shed 1.6 percent, hitting a one-week low and lately forming a “death cross” - a bearish signal - with the 50-day moving average breaking below the 200-day moving average. The index has lost nearly 11 percent this year. Speculation swirled in China’s cash market on Thursday of another credit squeeze after an early spike in the overnight rate ahead of imminent tax payments by banks. However, rates quickly fell back amid talk of action by major state-owned banks. The pace of the monthly rise in China’s home prices slowed slightly in June for a third straight month, though the year-on-year gains were the strongest this year, underlining challenges faced by Beijing in its fight to tame housing inflation. “Fears are growing that the liquidity shock a few weeks ago may be starting to trickle into the sector,” said Lee Wee Liat, BNP Paribas head of Asia property. China’s frothy property market is seen by analysts as one of the biggest financial risks to the world’s second-largest economy, along with the run-up of debt by local governments and the explosive growth of the opaque “shadow banking” system. Chinese money market rates have moderated since the central bank allowed short-term borrowing costs to spike to record levels on June 20, bluntly messaging overstretched lenders that it was determined to get risky credit expansion under control. Asian shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index, slipped 0.4 percent, reversing an early rise that let them hover near a five-week high touched on Wednesday. Seoul shares fell 0.6 percent, with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics Co Ltd down 2.1 percent partly due to Intel’s grim outlook, while Taipei’s share index dropped 0.8 percent. Underscoring worries over China’s economic slowdown, Japanese manufacturers’ mood worsened in July for the first time in eight months, a Reuters poll showed. Tokyo’s Nikkei advanced 1.3 percent, however, helped by the yen weakness and a 4 percent rise for SoftBank Corp  after China’s e-commerce Alibaba Group, in which the Japanese mobile operator owns about 30 percent, nearly tripled its net income in the first three months of the year. The U.S. currency was up 0.5 percent at 100.095 yen, extending the previous session’s 0.5 percent rise versus the yen, while the euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.30940. Bernanke’s remarks to a U.S. congressional committee contained “something for everybody”, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. “Bernanke has done a good job of leaving himself plenty of manoeuvre room in terms of policy.” The Fed chief’s comments came as its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity showed the U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July, but U.S. housing data was disappointing. In the commodity markets, gold inched up 0.1 percent after falling 1.3 percent on Wednesday, while copper prices  dipped 0.1 to remained below $7,000 a tonne after falling 1.5 percent in the previous session. Brent crude prices eased 0.1 percent to around $108.50 a barrel after gaining 0.6 percent on Wednesday after data from U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a fall  in American crude stocks."
2013-10-15,-13,"* Citigroup profit hit by bond trading slowdown, shares fall * Intel and Yahoo both rise after market close on results * Indexes off: Dow 0.9 pct; S&P 0.7 pct; Nasdaq 0.6 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in a volatile session on Tuesday as the impasse over the debt ceiling in Washington continued with no sign of progress towards a resolution. Despite some key corporate earnings, traders held off on making big bets given the political uncertainty. Selling accelerated during the afternoon after Senator Richard Durbin said Senate negotiations had been suspended until House Speaker John Boehner can work out a fiscal plan that can proceed in the House of Representatives. Losses were broad, with all 10 S&P 500 sectors falling on the day. Three-fourths of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange ended lower while 68 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares fell. Lawmakers have until Oct. 17 to agree to extend the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing limit or the country will risk an unprecedented debt default. The White House and Senate rejected the House’s latest offer, while Republican leaders also failed to get support for the plan from rank and file members within their party. Markets have largely avoided steep losses on optimism that lawmakers would agree to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. At the same time, volatility has spiked as the deadline approaches with little obvious progress seen. The CBOE Volatility index jumped 16 percent and is up more than 40 percent over the past four weeks. “The odds that there won’t be a deal over the next month are near zero, but there is some chance we won’t see something by the 17th. If that happens ... we could easily correct 3-5 percent,” said Jim McDonald, who helps oversee $803 billion as chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “While the market has climbed over the past two weeks,” he added, “that would reverse if there was any real concern” about missing the deadline. Among other assets, crude oil fell 1.5 percent while gold, which is viewed as a safe haven, rose 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 133.25 points, or 0.87 percent, at 15,168.01. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 12.08 points, or 0.71 percent, at 1,698.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 21.26 points, or 0.56 percent, at 3,794.01. Despite the day’s decline, the S&P remains above its key moving averages, which have been serving as support. The index is currently about 0.6 percent above its 14-day moving average. The situation in Washington has driven trading lately, overshadowing the beginning of a busy week of earnings. Citigroup Inc reported weaker-than-expected results as the bank was hit by a double-digit drop in bond trading revenue for the quarter, sending shares down 1.5 percent to $48.86. Johnson & Johnson reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on strong growth for its prescription drugs, while Coca-Cola Co reported revenue slightly under expectations. J&J rose 0.1 percent to $89.93 while Coca-Cola fell 0.7 percent to $37.66. Both companies are Dow components. Intel Corp shares rose 1.8 percent after the market closed. The company reported revenue that topped expectations. CSX Corp and Yahoo Inc both also rose after posting results after the close. Shares of Teradata Corp fell 18.4 percent to $42.91, a day after the data analytics firm cut its full-year earnings forecast. With 7 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 52.8 percent have reported profits that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the historical average of 63 percent. There have also been fewer companies beating revenue forecasts this quarter. FedEx, the world’s No. 2 package carrier, authorized a share repurchase program of up to 32 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, sending shares up 4.1 percent to $120.08. On the downside, J.C. Penney Co Inc sank 8.9 percent to $7.17 as a company spokesperson denied a market rumor that the department store chain had hired bankruptcy counsel. The stock has fallen 63 percent so far this year. Data showed the pace of growth in New York state’s manufacturing sector slipped this month to its slowest since May, but business optimism stayed strong."
2015-01-15,-12,"“We’re probably going to see slowing in the global economy, and it will be very difficult to sail through a global recession without getting touched,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive officer of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. The S&P 500 for the first time in a month ended below 2,000, considered a psychological support level, and closed below its 120-day moving average, suggesting more weakness ahead. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX notched a fifth day of gains, up 4.2 percent at 22.39. Expectations for U.S. fourth-quarter earnings have been scaled back sharply, with growth now estimated at 3.5 percent, compared with an Oct. 1 estimate of 11.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.        The S&P financial sector .SPSY dropped 1.3 percent. Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 5.2 percent to $15.20, among the S&P 500’s biggest drags, after the second-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a 14 percent slump in quarterly profit. Citigroup (C.N) shares fell 3.7 percent to $47.23 after its results. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 106.38 points, or 0.61 percent, to 17,320.71, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 18.6 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,992.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 68.50 points, or 1.48 percent, to 4,570.82. After the close, S&P 500 e-minis ESc1 fell further, hitting session lows. The benchmark S&P 500 is now down 4.7 percent from its Dec. 29 record high. Adding to volatility, the Swiss National Bank scrapped its cap on the franc currency in a surprise move. U.S.-traded Swiss stocks climbed. Credit Suisse (CS.N) was up 1.8 percent at $23.22 and Novartis (NVS.N) jumped 3.9 percent to $100.58 as a strengthening franc made U.S.-dollar denominated stocks cheaper. Best Buy (BBY.N) shares tumbled 14.1 percent to $34.30 as the worst-performing S&P 500 component. The electronics retailer expects same-store sales growth to be flat to negative in the first two quarters of its fiscal year. After the bell, shares of Intel (INTC.O) dipped 2.1 percent to $35.44 following its results.   In economic news, U.S. producer prices recorded their biggest fall in more than three years in December, while other reports showed mixed signals for manufacturing in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region in January. About 7.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.3 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.  NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,995 to 1,091, for a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,152 issues fell and 603 advanced for a 3.57-to-1 ratio.

2015-09-08,-2,"Technology research firm Gartner ranks ForeScout as a market leader in the field of access control, which scans an organization remotely to detect every device connecting to its networks, while blocking out anything lacking appropriate credentials. Its technology is in strong demand following recent high-profile data breaches at retailers, banks and media companies, and detection and response is the fastest-growing sector of the security business, according to Gartner.  That makes ForeScout confident it can maintain 50 percent annual revenue growth, seen over the past few years, for the next several years, Michael DeCesare, a security software veteran who took over as CEO in March, told Reuters.   But the Silicon Valley-based company, with research facilities in Israel, says it needs to raise more money and expand its business before its planned IPO on Wall Street. It has raised around $80 million from investors since its launch in 2000. “I still have things I have to fix in our business and there is a somewhat tumultuous (financial) market environment ... Some things are a little more difficult to pin down,” DeCesare said during a visit to Israel. “It’s when we’re ready. If the market falls sharply next year I don’t want to go public.” In 2015, revenues are set to surpass $110 million, with billings from its 1,800 clients to top $140 million, he said.     “We will be raising money to try and continue to fuel that growth. We have an IPO in the horizon but I‘m not ready yet.”  He would not comment on the size of a future IPO. DeCesare, who until last year was president of Intel’s security division McAfee, said he plans to double the company’s engineering staff in Israel to over 200 workers in the next 12-18 months and invest in sales and support staff. It employs another 300 workers in the United States and elsewhere.         ForeScout’s rivals include Cisco (CSCO.O) and HP’s (HPQ.N) Aruba as well as Trustwave, which was acquired in May by Singtel (STEL.SI).  Gartner estimates that by 2020, 60 percent of information security budgets of companies worldwide will be allocated to breach detection and response — up from less than 10 percent in 2014.     That will mark a big change for companies, which currently rely on older firewall technology to secure their networks, spending $32 billion on security products in 2014, according to IDC.

2012-04-18,-4,"* 22 S&P 500 companies due to report earns Wed * Futures off: Dow 35 pts, S&P 3.2 pts, Nasdaq 2 pts By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised for a lower open on Wednesday after the S&P 500 notched its biggest gain in a month as investors digested another round of corporate earnings. The benchmark S&P on Tuesday climbed 1.55 percent, its biggest percentage gain since March 13, after Coca-Cola Co  led a round of solid earnings reports and on concerns eased over the euro zone debt crisis. “Investors don’t like volatility but large run-ups can be equally unsettling too because investors question if that is going to hold,” said Tim Speiss, a partner at Eisner Amper in New York. According to Thomson Reuters data, 22 companies in the S&P 500 were expected to report on Wednesday, including American Express Co, Qualcomm Inc and eBay Inc. Of the 39 S&P 500 companies posting earnings before Tuesday’s opening bell, 74.4 percent beat estimates. International Business Machines Corp shed 2.2 percent to $203 in premarket trade after reporting quarterly profit late Tuesday that beat expectations but revenue missed estimates. “Investors should not overreact to positive news nor should they be overreacting to really what could be viewed as isolated earnings reports. One report does not make a trend, unfortunately,” said Speiss. Intel Corp dropped 2.7 percent to $27.69 premarket after the chipmaker said late Tuesday sales would accelerate in the second half of the year, but the costs of upgrading its chipmaking factories were temporarily hurting margins. S&P 500 futures fell 3.2 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 35 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 2 points. BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, said first-quarter profits were steady, bolstered by strong inflows into its popular iShares exchange-traded funds. Halliburton Co advanced 1.9 percent to $33.29 in premarket after the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company reported higher quarterly profit as North American revenue reached a record high. Earnings at diversified U.S. manufacturer Textron Inc  quadrupled, helped by a strong recovery in demand for business aircraft and helicopters. Textron gained 1.3 percent to $28 premarket. Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food group, is near a deal to buy Pfizer Inc’s infant nutrition business for up to $10 billion to boost its China business and extend its lead in the baby formula milk sector, sources said. Pfizer slipped 0.4 percent to $22.23 premarket. SXC Health Solutions Corp  will buy pharmacy benefit manager Catalyst Health Solutions Inc for about $4.4 billion. Catalyst jumped 32 percent to $83.87 and U.S.-listed shares of SXC Health climbed 9 percent to $87.50. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chief Executive Warren Buffett said he has stage 1 prostate cancer but it “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” Berkshire Class B shares lost 1.1 percent to $79.91 premarket.

2012-10-16,-9,"* Johnson & Johnson increases profit view * Citigroup CEO Pandit resigns unexpectedly * Dow up 1 pct, S&P 500 up 1 pct, Nasdaq up 1.2 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, giving the S&P 500 its best two-day advance in a month as strong earnings from Johnson & Johnson and other bellwether companies raised hopes for the rest of the U.S. reporting season. Diversified U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson  also increased its full-year profit outlook. Its stock rose 1.4 percent to $69.55, helping the Dow Jones industrial average register its best day since Sept. 13, when the Federal Reserve unveiled its third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing, known as “QE3.” Goldman Sachs earnings also beat expectations, its revenue more than doubled and it raised its quarterly dividend. But it earned less money from customers’ trading, and the stock lost 1 percent to $123.22. Goldman’s results followed upbeat earnings from Citigroup Inc in the previous session. Shares of Citigroup jumped 1.6 percent to $37.25 on Tuesday after the surprising resignation of Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit.  An S&P financial-sector index rose 0.7 percent. The reports were among a flood of results from 80 S&P 500 companies as the third-quarter earnings season picks up the pace. A spate of corporate warnings heading into the period raised worries that slower growth in Europe and China may be affecting corporate America more than previously thought. “Financials have proven to be fairly good, and that has given the market a second push this week, compared to declines last week,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. “There may be a push upwards, depending on results, but we’ll be waiting until economic indicators improve.” Overall S&P 500 companies’ quarterly earnings still are expected to decline 2.3 percent from a year ago, but the forecast does mark a slight improvement from estimates last week, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 127.55 points, or 0.95 percent, to close at 13,551.78. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 14.79 points, or 1.03 percent, to finish at 1,454.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.99 points, or 1.21 percent, to end at 3,101.17. The S&P 500 has gained 1.8 percent in the last two days, rebounding from last week’s slide of 2.2 percent. That was the benchmark index’s worst week in four months. After the bell, shares of International Business Machines Corp fell 3.3 percent to $204.10 f ollowing the release of its results. IBM closed at $211, up 1 percent. Shares of Intel Corp also declined after the bell. Intel slipped 1.5 percent to $22.02 after the world’s largest chipmaker forecast gross margins for the current quarter below expectations. During the regular session, Coca-Cola Co shares slipped 0.6 percent to $37.90 after it reported a rise in earnings. The world’s biggest soft drinks maker reported quarterly revenue that was short of Wall Street’s expectations, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia. Among other earnings reports, U.S. insurer UnitedHealth reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, but it gave a cautious outlook. Its shares fell 1.1 percent to $56.88. Economic data showed the overall U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in September as the cost of gasoline surged, posing a threat to consumers’ spending power. On the other hand,  inflation pressures looked unlikely to derail the Federal Reserve’s ultra-easy policy path. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core CPI was up 0.1 percent - less than the forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent. Volume was roughly 6.2 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, compared with the year-to-date average daily closing volume of 6.51 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of slightly more than 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about two stocks rose for every one that fell."
2015-09-08,-3,"* Revenue seen rising 50 pct annually for next few years * By 2020 detection/response products to dominate market * ForeScout to double staff in Israel in 12-18 months By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Fast-growing Israeli-U.S. cybersecurity firm ForeScout Technologies is set on listing on Wall Street, but may not be ready to launch an IPO in the next year, especially if financial markets remain volatile, its chief executive said. Technology research firm Gartner ranks ForeScout as a market leader in the field of access control, which scans an organisation remotely to detect every device connecting to its networks, while blocking out anything lacking appropriate credentials. Its technology is in strong demand following recent high-profile data breaches at retailers, banks and media companies, and detection and response is the fastest-growing sector of the security business, according to Gartner. That makes ForeScout confident it can maintain 50 percent annual revenue growth, seen over the past few years, for the next several years, Michael DeCesare, a security software veteran who took over as CEO in March, told Reuters. But the Silicon Valley-based company, with research facilities in Israel, says it needs to raise more money and expand its business before its planned IPO on Wall Street. It has raised around $80 million from investors since its launch in 2000. “I still have things I have to fix in our business and there is a somewhat tumultuous (financial) market environment ... Some things are a little more difficult to pin down,” DeCesare said during a visit to Israel. “It’s when we’re ready. If the market falls sharply next year I don’t want to go public.” In 2015, revenues are set to surpass $110 million, with billings from its 1,800 clients to top $140 million, he said. “We will be raising money to try and continue to fuel that growth. We have an IPO in the horizon but I‘m not ready yet.”  He would not comment on the size of a future IPO. DeCesare, who until last year was president of Intel’s security division McAfee, said he plans to double the company’s engineering staff in Israel to over 200 workers in the next 12-18 months and invest in sales and support staff. It employs another 300 workers in the United States and elsewhere. ForeScout’s rivals include Cisco and HP’s  Aruba as well as Trustwave, which was acquired in May by Singtel . Gartner estimates that by 2020, 60 percent of information security budgets of companies worldwide will be allocated to breach detection and response - up from less than 10 percent in 2014. That will mark a big change for companies, which currently rely on older firewall technology to secure their networks, spending $32 billion on security products in 2014, according to IDC. ForeScout’s investors include UK-based Amadeus Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, Accel Partners, and Pitango Venture Capital, Israel’s biggest venture fund. Several Israeli security firms such as Cyber-Ark Software  have gone public in recent years with successful offerings, following in the footsteps of computer security pioneer Check Point Software, Israel’s biggest tech firm.

2015-01-15,-16,"* U.S. crude falls more than 4 percent * Swiss National Bank scraps three-year-old euro cap on franc * Best Buy shares fall * Indexes off: Dow 0.6 percent, S&P 0.9 percent, Nasdaq 1.5 percent   (Updates with futures falling further after close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a fifth straight session Thursday as bank results disappointed and investors fretted over the potential impact of global economic weakness on U.S. corporate earnings. Energy shares extended recent losses as U.S. oil prices  settled down more than 4 percent after weak U.S. economic data spurred worries over oil demand. The S&P energy index fell 1.2 percent. “We’re probably going to see slowing in the global economy, and it will be very difficult to sail through a global recession without getting touched,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive officer of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. The S&P 500 for the first time in a month ended below 2,000, considered a psychological support level, and closed below its 120-day moving average, suggesting more weakness ahead. The CBOE Volatility index notched a fifth day of gains, up 4.2 percent at 22.39. Expectations for U.S. fourth-quarter earnings have been scaled back sharply, with growth now estimated at 3.5 percent, compared with an Oct. 1 estimate of 11.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P financial sector dropped 1.3 percent. Bank of America lost 5.2 percent to $15.20, among the S&P 500’s biggest drags, after the second-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a 14 percent slump in quarterly profit.  Citigroup shares fell 3.7 percent to $47.23 after its results. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.38 points, or 0.61 percent, to 17,320.71, the S&P 500 lost 18.6 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,992.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 68.50 points, or 1.48 percent, to 4,570.82. After the close, S&P 500 e-minis fell further, hitting session lows. The benchmark S&P 500 is now down 4.7 percent from its Dec. 29 record high. Adding to volatility, the Swiss National Bank scrapped its cap on the franc currency in a surprise move. U.S.-traded Swiss stocks climbed. Credit Suisse was up 1.8 percent at $23.22 and Novartis jumped 3.9 percent to $100.58 as a strengthening franc made U.S.-dollar denominated stocks cheaper. Best Buy shares tumbled 14.1 percent to $34.30 as the worst-performing S&P 500 component. The electronics retailer expects same-store sales growth to be flat to negative in the first two quarters of its fiscal year. After the bell, shares of Intel dipped 2.1 percent to $35.44 following its results. In economic news, U.S. producer prices recorded their biggest fall in more than three years in December, while other reports showed mixed signals for manufacturing in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region in January. About 7.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.3 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets. NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,995 to 1,091, for a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 2,152 issues fell and 603 advanced for a 3.57-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 30 new highs and 134 new lows.

2013-11-03,-17,"BERLIN, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden said calls for more oversight of government intelligence agencies showed he was justified in revealing the methods and targets of the U.S. secret service. Snowden’s leaks about the National Security Agency (NSA), from its alleged mass scanning of emails to the tapping of world leaders’ phones, have infuriated U.S. allies and placed Washington on the defensive. In “A Manifesto for the Truth” published in German news magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday, Snowden said current debates about mass surveillance in many countries showed his revelations were helping to bring about change. “Instead of causing damage, the usefulness of the new public knowledge for society is now clear because reforms to politics, supervision and laws are being suggested,” the 30-year-old ex-CIA employee and NSA contractor wrote. “Citizens have to fight against the suppression of information about affairs of essential importance for the public. Those who speak the truth are not committing a crime.” Snowden is in Russia, where he has been given asylum for at least a year. In an open letter to Germany last week, Snowden said he was counting on international support to stop Washington’s ‘persecution’ of him. His revelations about the reach and methods of the NSA, including the monitoring of vast volumes of Internet traffic and phone records, have angered U.S. allies from Germany to Brazil. Admirers have called Snowden a human rights champion. Others say he is a traitor for stealing information from the NSA after vowing to respect its secrecy policies and then fleeing first to Hong Kong and then to Russia with classified U.S. data. Snowden declined a job offer from Russia’s top social networking site VKontakte (InTouch), local media quoted one of the company’s founders, Pavel Durov, as saying over the weekend. A Russian lawyer with close links to the authorities who is assisting Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, had said this week the American would start work in November for a “large Russian (web)site” that he refused to name for security reasons. In the manifesto published on Sunday, Snowden said mass surveillance was a global problem that needed global solutions and added that secret services’ “criminal surveillance programmes” jeopardized individual privacy, freedom of opinion and open societies. The existence of spying technology should not determine politics, he said: “We have a moral duty to ensure that our laws and values limit surveillance programmes and protect human rights”. Society, said Snowden, could only understand and keep a check on these problems via an open, ruthless and informed debate. He said some governments that felt exposed by the revelations had at first launched a “persecution campaign” to repress debate by intimidating journalists and threatening them with prosecution. “At that time the public was not in a position to judge the usefulness of these revelations. People trusted that their governments would make the right decisions,” he said. “Today we know that was a mistake and that such behaviour does not serve the public interest,” he said.

2017-09-11,-4,"The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, is expected to take several years before ruling on the appeal. A court spokeswoman said Google had not asked for an interim order to suspend the European Union decision. The Commission, which ordered Google to stop the practice by Sept. 28, is reviewing Google’s proposal on how it would comply with the EU decision. The EU competition enforcer will defend its decision in court, a spokesman said. Lobby group FairSearch, whose members include Google rivals such as British shopping comparison site Foundem and U.S. travel site TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), said the EU decision was sound. “The Commission’s decision stands on firm ground, both legally and factually, and we expect the Commission to win on appeal,” FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said. The EU Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered a lower tribunal last week to re-examine U.S. chipmaker Intel’s appeal against a 1.06 billion euro fine, a rare setback for the Commission. The Google case differs from Intel‘s, but the judgment has been welcomed by companies under EU scrutiny because it raises the bar for the regulator to prove wrongdoing. "

2017-11-02,-4,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has sued Apple Inc , alleging that it violated a software license contract to benefit rival chipmaker Intel for making broadband modems, the latest salvo in a longstanding dispute between the two companies. Qualcomm alleged in a lawsuit filed in the California state court in San Diego on Wednesday that Apple used its commercial leverage to demand unprecedented access to the chipmaker’s highly confidential software, including source code. Apple, which could not be immediately reached for comments, started using Intel’s broadband modem chips in the iPhone 7.

According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the Hebrew University scientific community, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, according to the SEC’s complaint.

2017-09-15,5,"McAfee, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital (51%) and computer hardware giant Intel (49%), is raising loans, which are more flexible and easier to repay than bonds as it discusses a 2018 equity listing with banks, a source close to the deal said. The US$4.75bn of loans will refinance US$2.2bn of debt that financed McAfee’s spinoff from parent Intel, which was completed on April 3. The dividend payment of around US$2bn is one of the largest dividend payments on record, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. The deal brings the total volume of dividend recapitalizations this year to US$11.3bn, compared to US$24.4bn in 2016, the data shows. Intel provided the initial financing for the spinoff with promissory notes due to the complexity of the deal and the absence of audited financials, which are generally required for agencies to rate companies’ debt. The notes paid a relatively high interest rate of 7%. McAfee completed its audits in July, two sources said. Strong debt markets and the company’s relatively low adjusted leverage are now allowing McAfee to raise the loan, which is new money for the company, and will reduce its borrowing costs substantially as well as paying the dividend to shareholders. Although McAfee’s financing is being marketed as a dividend deal, its pre-IPO financing is not a traditional recapitalization. Intel’s initial provision of McAfee’s debt means this is the first time investors will be gaining exposure to the company. The US$2bn dividend payment will also partly refinance some of the equity that TPG used to buy the company, a senior banker said. A euro tranche was added during syndication allowing McAfee to broaden its currency exposure after reverse enquiry from European investors, a person familiar with the matter said. The deal will increase McAfee’s adjusted leverage from 4x to less than 6x, the person said. Although loan investors would have supported leverage of around 7x, the company opted for a lower multiple to appeal to equity investors as the company prepares for its IPO, the first source said. The US leveraged loan market has been remarkably strong this year with relatively little new acquisition financing. Investors are responding well to the new money deal and the chance to gain exposure to McAfee, after Intel initially provided the original financing, the second person familiar with the matter said. The leverage levels and pricing are also attractive to investors, who prefer lending to larger, more liquid loans. The deal, which launched on September 7, has already lined up several large orders before its commitment deadline of September 21, sources said. Pricing guidance on the first-lien loans is circulating in the 475bp-400bp over Libor and Euribor range. The interest rate on the second-lien loan is expected to be in the 775bp-800bp range. McAfee opted to line up a second-lien loan rather than issuing high-yield bonds as the loans can be repaid earlier than bonds, which have non-call provisions. Loan investors view an IPO as a positive credit event as they expect some of the loan to be repaid with the proceeds. Intel announced the US$7.7bn acquisition of McAfee in August 2010. The spin-off, which was announced in September 2016 and completed in April, was originally valued at US$4.2bn, according to Intel. Intel considers McAfee a strategic asset and that there is no interest in currently exiting its stake in the company, a source close to Intel said. Intel, TPG Capital, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan declined to comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Schwarzberg; Editing By Tessa Walsh and Michelle Sierra)"

2017-07-06,-24,"In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm. Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks."

There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.  Separately from this dispute, Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. "
2017-08-10,3,"But even a strong quarterly report may not be enough to drive additional short-term gains, warned Joel Kulina, a technology stock trader at Wedbush in Toronto. “My gut is to the downside,” Kulina said. “If it traded up 10 percent tonight, I’d be floored.” Nvidia’s drop on Thursday accompanied a 1.6 percent slump in the Nasdaq and a 1.1 percent decline in the S&P 500. The company’s second-quarter results, due out after the close of the U.S. stock market, are likely to be lifted by demand related to Nintendo’s Switch videogame console and cryptocurrency “miners,” Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a research note on Tuesday. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques for security and can be sold for money. Miners use computers to process cryptocurrency transactions, and they are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP made cryptocurrencies popular in recent years, but newer technologies, including Ethereum, have sparked a wave of mining using high-end gaming graphics cards. These cards are made with chips from Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), with some products selling out. Following its second-quarter report, AMD said cryptocurrency miners contributed to strong demand for its chips.  Analysts, on average, expect Nvidia to report revenue growth for the quarter through July of 37 percent to $1.96 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Nvidia recently traded at 52 times expected earnings, compared to an earnings multiple of 57 for AMD and 12 for Intel (INTC.O).  Underscoring growing interest from technology heavyweights, Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday announced it was working on blockchain, a public book-keeping system central to cryptocurrencies. Chipmaker Intel said in press release it was working with Microsoft on the project. “Intel is an active participant in the blockchain revolution,” it said. "

Qualcomm declined to comment. Intel and Apple rival Samsung are members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group.  ”If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices,“ Ed Black, the CEO of the group, said in a statement. “What’s at stake here is certainly the availability of iPhones and other smartphones at better prices.” Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks. The two have been locked in a sprawling legal battle in which Apple has objected to Qualcomm’s business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips. In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm’s profit outlook.  Earlier this month, Qualcomm sued Apple on separate allegations that Apple infringed six patents around making iPhones work better without draining the battery. Simultaneously, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the U.S. ITC seeking to ban iPhones that use chips “other than those supplied by Qualcomm affiliates.” Apple began using Intel chips in the iPhone 7. "
2017-10-27,3,"Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Intel together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output. Judging by premarket gains, the tech giants could add another $75 billion to their combined market value, and spark a broader rally when the market opens on Friday. The companies beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue for the quarter, riding on bumper demand for their cloud computing businesses as corporate computing shifts away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud. “Obviously we are headed for a strong opening due to the smashing results from the tech heavyweights,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies.” Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets on the stocks. Credit Suisse raised its price target on Amazon.com Inc to $1,385 from $1,350, indicating that the stock has room to climb another 42 percent over the next 12 months from Thursday’s close. The brokerage also made the most bullish moves on Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp. Deutsche Bank, the most bullish brokerage on Alphabet, said the company can add another 24 percent to its shares in the next 12 months. While the market is used to record-breaking results from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp’s revenue rose the most in percentage terms in three years, underscoring the success of Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy. Even old guard Intel Corp, which has been struggling with tepid growth, said revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent, slightly beating expectations. "

The EU Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered a lower tribunal last week to re-examine U.S. chipmaker Intel’s appeal against a 1.06 billion euro fine, a rare setback for the Commission. The Google case differs from Intel‘s, but the judgment has been welcomed by companies under EU scrutiny because it raises the bar for the regulator to prove wrongdoing. "

2016-09-20,3,"These “teardowns”, as they are known in the electronics industry, showed that for the first time Intel’s thin modem, which uses Ceva’s design, is in some versions of Apple’s new smartphone. For the last several years Intel’s competitor Qualcomm dominated the market for these chips. “Since 2012 our numbers were down because of Qualcomm,” Ceva Chief Financial Officer Yaniv Arieli told Reuters on Tuesday. “This year that’s changing and our customers are successful in launching their own LTE chips,” he added, referring to the chips used in 4G mobile communications. Ceva’s Nasdaq-traded shares jumped 10.3 percent to a record $34.99 on Monday in more than four times its daily average volume. Analysts raised their forecasts for the company, citing the teardowns, which can be found on the websites www.chipworks.com and www.ifixit.com. “We view Ceva as one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+,” said Benchmark analyst Gary Mobley. He estimated that Intel and Qualcomm may equally split the thin modem supply for the iPhone, which could boost Ceva’s adjusted earnings per share in 2017 by as much as 25 cents. Analysts on average forecast Ceva will earn 84 cents a share in 2016. Canaccord raised its price target for Ceva to $40 from $38 and its adjusted earnings per share estimate to $1.11 from $1.05. Ceva estimates its designs will be included in almost 200 million LTE phones in 2016 and is targeting 400-500 million phones annually within three years. Arieli said this was not just from high-end Apple and Samsung phones but from emerging economies where smartphones costing under $100 are more popular. "

According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the scientific academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Darvasi, of Mevasseret Zion, Israel, is a genetics professor at the university, while Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, the SEC said. It was unclear whether Darvasi and Waldman have hired lawyers. Darvasi did not immediately respond to an email request for comment after normal business hours in Israel.

2017-11-10,-2,"Nvidia’s gaming revenue in the latest quarter blew past Wall Street estimates but it was the data center business, the driver of future growth, that made analysts stand up and take notice as revenue in the unit more than doubled.  Revenue from the data center business, Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue contributor, rose to $501 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise,” Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note. Shah raised his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “reduce.” The company, which gets the bulk of revenue from gaming where it supplies chips for gaming consoles, has seen explosive growth at its data centers operations. Nvidia launched the Volta chips in May as part of its Tesla V100 data center graphic processing unit (GPU) that will power systems from artificial intelligence (AI) to driverless cars. “Volta’s launch we suspect was a major catalyst for Intel to go back to the drawing board with its AI chip Nervana, the tactical need to use AMD GPU, and the hire of Raja Koduri to head Intel’s new Graphics effort,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann. Early this week, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) partnered with bitter rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) for a graphics chip that will help the chipmakers take on Nvidia. Intel also named AMD’s ex-GPU head, Koduri, as chief architect of the newly-formed Core and Visual Computing Group​.  “Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday. Nvidia’s data centers business, which caters to clients such as Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Azure, was a point of concern after a disappointing showing last quarter. But the Volta chip changed all that. “The ramp of Volta seems to be tracking well, and more importantly, has significant runway ahead, in our view, as a broader set of customers adopt the new architecture in the coming quarters,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note. The company claims that Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry and humanity's moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences and self-driving vehicles. bit.ly/2iJPeNN  At least 14 analysts raised their price target on the stock.

2017-08-08,-12,"The ITC will make its decision “at the earliest practicable time” and will set a target date for completing its investigation within the next 45 days, the commission said in a statement. Qualcomm filed the complaint in early July, asking U.S. trade regulators to ban certain models of the iPhone that contain so-called broadband modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, that were not made by Qualcomm. Apple began using broadband modem chips made by Intel Corp in the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but says the way Apple uses them in the iPhone does. ”We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. Intel declined to comment. Apple pointed to Chief Executive Tim Cook’s earlier comments that Qualcomm had not yet offered it “fair and reasonable” licensing terms for Qualcomm’s technology. ”I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that,“ Cook told investors in May on the company’s earnings call, his most recent public comment on the topic. ”I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” As the ITC considered whether to take up the case, a group representing Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc sided last month with Apple, saying Qualcomm’s request to bar the import of some iPhones would hurt consumers. In turn, Qualcomm accused the group of “a coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting” the trade regulators. It said Apple was free to choose chips from a variety of vendors without necessarily infringing Qualcomm’s patents. The fight before trade regulators in Washington is one of several major legal battles involving Qualcomm and Apple. The two companies have cases pending before separate federal courts in California, and Qualcomm also faces a complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Analysts are watching the ITC case closely because the trade regulator moves more quickly than many courts and could deliver a decision ahead of the pending lawsuits."

The company’s second-quarter results, due out after the close of the U.S. stock market, are likely to be lifted by demand related to Nintendo’s Switch videogame console and cryptocurrency “miners,” Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a research note on Tuesday. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques for security and can be sold for money. Miners use computers to process cryptocurrency transactions, and they are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP made cryptocurrencies popular in recent years, but newer technologies, including Ethereum, have sparked a wave of mining using high-end gaming graphics cards. These cards are made with chips from Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), with some products selling out. Following its second-quarter report, AMD said cryptocurrency miners contributed to strong demand for its chips.  Analysts, on average, expect Nvidia to report revenue growth for the quarter through July of 37 percent to $1.96 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Nvidia recently traded at 52 times expected earnings, compared to an earnings multiple of 57 for AMD and 12 for Intel (INTC.O).  Underscoring growing interest from technology heavyweights, Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Thursday announced it was working on blockchain, a public book-keeping system central to cryptocurrencies. Chipmaker Intel said in press release it was working with Microsoft on the project. “Intel is an active participant in the blockchain revolution,” it said. "
2017-09-27,2,"Clark, in a meeting with investors, said Aptiv PLC, the name announced earlier on Wednesday for Delphi’s $12 billion a year electronics and self-driving car technology business, expects to grow faster than the auto market, and generate $2 billion to $2.5 billion in operating cash flow by 2020. Delphi’s $4.5 billion a year internal combustion powertrain technology business will be named Delphi Technologies, and should generate about $700 million a year in operating cash flow by 2020, the company told investors. “We are two separate companies that will stand on our own,” Clark told reporters during a call.

2017-04-13,3,"That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies.  Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV MBLY.N, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems.  ”Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles.  Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programing and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry.  Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co (GM.N) are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house.  Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK)  The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology.  “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together,” said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo.  BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology.  “These different approaches will have to pass the test of time,” he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.”  "

Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV , and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. ”Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd (For a graphic on self-driving vehicles see: tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc) The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together,” said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. “These different approaches will have to pass the test of time,” he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” "
2017-10-04,-2,"Including the latest funding round, the company has so far raised $47.5 million, Chief Executive David King told Reuters in an interview on Monday. He declined to disclose the company’s current valuation. Founded in 2014, FogHorn is one of the first companies to make software in the little-known area of fog or edge computing that locally analyzes data collected from sensors deployed in industrial equipment to increase speed and save costs. Edge computing eliminates the need for sending the data to the cloud, instead processing the information where it was generated, in milliseconds. Many industrial companies are deploying sensors or so-called Industrial Internet of Things, which enables machines to talk to each other and detect problems before they occur.  California-based FogHorn said Honeywell Ventures also took part in the latest funding round, joining existing investors March Capital, GE, Dell Technologies Capital, Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Yokogawa and Darling Ventures. FogHorn’s computing engine can run big data analytics and machine learning on devices that have lower processing power. The company has forged partnerships with Intel, Dell, GE and other technology companies to get its technology integrated in their products. FogHorn, which has dozens of customers including Saudi Aramco, GE (GE.N), Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), is in the early revenue generation stage, King said.  "

2017-03-30,1,"The complexity of self-driving cars is forcing high tech software and semiconductor companies to team up with auto suppliers and manufacturers, a dynamic that is likely to spur more takeovers and acquisitions going forward, ZF’s CEO said. “If you look at all of these megamergers, they have a clear deal rationale. As this is the case, and we still have companies that collaborate, and could still collaborate, I am expecting more megamergers,” Sommer told journalists gathered at the company’s annual results press conference in Friedrichshafen, Germany on Thursday.

2017-05-19,-3,"By Rina Chandran MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A high-tech bangle that alerts pregnant women to toxic fumes and issues audio tips promises to boost maternal health in South Asia, as smart devices deliver ever more services to remote communities. The colorful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men - feeding information directly to expectant mothers - and is built to withstand the rigors of village life. “In rural areas, mobile connectivity - and mobile access for women - is an issue, as phones are controlled by men,” said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Grameen Intel Social Business, which developed the new device. “While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realized a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy.  Nor does it not need an internet connection to work. Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd., a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust.  The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said. Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor.  An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away.  Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia. Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics. In Bangladesh, where more than 70 percent of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO. In neighboring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh - among the poorest states in the country - maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher. At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient’s cholesterol or insulin levels. It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under $50, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Coel, which will be priced initially at about $12-$15, will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq. “Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers,” he said.  “We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women.” "
2017-10-27,5,"The companies together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output. Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets, with the most bullish pegging the companies’ stocks to rise between 21 percent and 47 percent in the next 12 months. Google is “looking 20 years young,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who bumped up his price target on the stock by 9 percent to $1,150. Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares rose as much as 9 percent to a three-month high of $1,063.77. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet and Intel hit their highest in a decade. “I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said. Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition. Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business. The company’s stock is also relatively cheap, trading at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings, despite its 30 percent run this year, excluding gains on Friday. Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) revenue rose the most in percentage terms in three years, underscoring the success of Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy. “Maybe one man has changed the culture of a large organization of over 120,000 people to enable a more creative and innovative mass focused on winning. These results sure seem to indicate so,” Jefferies analysts said. Even old guard Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been struggling with tepid growth, said revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent, slightly beating expectations.     "
