2017-09-26,1,"Facebook has expressed interest in live-streaming NFL games on Thursday nights, including this year when it lost out to Amazon.com Inc. Amazon.com broadcasts its first Thursday night game this week.  The deal between the NFL and Facebook will not include live games but will cover official NFL video highlights from all regular season games as well as the playoffs and the Super Bowl, the NFL said in a statement.  Some NFL Films, documentary-style productions made by the league, will also be included.  “We have millions of fans on Facebook, and they continue to demonstrate an incredible appetite for NFL content,” Hans Schroeder, chief operating officer of NFL Media, said in a statement.  Facebook, though, is the biggest social network with some 2 billion monthly users worldwide. Its NFL videos will appear on Watch, the recently overhauled Facebook video tab.  Facebook hopes the deal will enable “active NFL fan communities on Facebook to watch and debate the top storylines from each week,” Dan Reed, Facebook’s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement.  Facebook Watch already includes one NFL-related program: a reality show on football player Mashawn Lynch for which Facebook is paying Time Warner Inc’s Bleacher Report millions of dollars.  "
2017-05-15,-4,"Thailand’s telecoms regulator said last week it would give Facebook Thailand until Tuesday to take down 131 web addresses with content deemed threatening to security or which violated strict lese majeste laws. The threat prompted a flurry of concern in the Southeast Asian country - one of the most Facebook-active countries in Asia - that Facebook would be blocked. Thailand’s Information Communications Technology Ministry temporarily blocked access to Facebook after a May 2014 coup by the military, prompting an outcry from netizens.

The social media giant already allows businesses to have conversations with Messenger’s 1.2 billion monthly users and send them sponsored content. Facebook, which gets about 85 percent of its ad revenue from mobile, has been trying to make money from the Messenger app to supplement its main revenue stream, which is expected to cool off this year.

2017-07-19,0,"The feature is likely to allow publishers to create a paywall on Facebook’s Instant Articles and guide readers to a publisher’s home page to opt for a digital subscription, according to TheStreet. Instant Articles lets publishers post articles directly to the Facebook app. The idea for a paywall is based on premium and metered plans and has been in the works for a while, TheStreet said, citing Brown at the Digital Publishing Innovation Summit in New York. Facebook also started the roll-out of a new tool that allows publishers using Instant Articles to measure how those articles perform compared with their own mobile websites.  Shares of Facebook closed up 0.79 percent at $164.14 on Wednesday. "

2017-06-15,-3,"Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, Monika Bickert, Facebook’s director of global policy management, and Brian Fishman, counterterrorism policy manager, explained in a blog post. Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda. “More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves, that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,” Bickert said in a telephone interview. Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other social media sites such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech. Government officials have threatened to fine the company and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users. Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said, “we’re talking about this is because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.” (Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)"
2017-10-23,-2,"The test, which is occurring in six smaller countries, now offers two user feeds, according to a statement from the company: one feed focused on friends and family and a second dedicated to the pages that the customer has liked. The change could force those who run pages, everyone from news outlets to musicians to sports teams, to pay to run advertisements if they want to be seen in the feed that is for friends and family.  The test is taking place in Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia and Sri Lanka, and it will likely go on for months, Adam Mosseri, the Facebook executive in charge of the News Feed, said in a blog post.  Mosseri said the company has no plans for a global test of the two separate feeds for its 2 billion users.  Facebook also does not currently plan to force commercial pages “to pay for all their distribution,” he said.  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, frequently tests changes big and small as it tries to maximize the time people spend scrolling and browsing the network. Sometimes it makes changes permanent, and other times not.  Depending on how people respond, two news feeds could mean that they see fewer links to news stories. News has proved to be a tricky area for Facebook, as hoaxes and false news stories have sometimes spread easily on the network. The test has already affected website traffic for smaller media outlets in recent days, Slovakian journalist Filip Struhárik wrote over the weekend in a post on Medium.  Publishers might need to buy more Facebook ads to be seen, he wrote: “If you want your Facebook page posts to be seen in old newsfeed, you have to pay.”  "

2017-06-22,0,"Zuckerberg said on his Facebook page that his company’s new mission is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”  The previous mission was “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” Facebook’s pursuit of that mission has been criticized in the past 12 months after the network became one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Zuckerberg said in February he wanted to boost the number of Facebook users who are members of what they called “very meaningful” groups. Only about 5 percent were members of such groups, he said then. The head of Facebook, with 1.9 billion users and $27.6 billion in revenue last year, was in Chicago on Thursday to meet people who run group pages on Facebook. “If what you’re trying to do is run a group that has thousands of people, you need tools to help manage that,” he told CNN in an interview. Facebook wants to build those tools, he said.  Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google also hosts community groups, as do Nextdoor and Meetup. Nextdoor, a site for neighbors to meet one another and share news and advice, said on Monday it was expanding into Germany after rapid growth elsewhere. Zuckerberg told CNN that supporting organizations built around neighbors, churches, pets and the like has a larger purpose.  “Once people are coming together in these smaller groups, that actually grows and it ends up with much bigger changes in the world,” he said.

2017-11-22,-6,"Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are facing a backlash after saying Russians used their services to anonymously spread divisive messages among Americans in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. elections.  U.S. lawmakers have criticized the tech firms for not doing more to detect the alleged election meddling, which the Russian government denies involvement in.  Facebook says the propaganda came from the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that according to lawmakers and researchers employs hundreds of people to push pro-Kremlin content under phony social media accounts.  As many as 126 million people could have been served posts on Facebook and 20 million on Instagram, the company says. Facebook has since deactivated the accounts.  Facebook, in a statement, said it would let people see which pages or accounts they liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017 that were affiliated with the Internet Research Agency.  The tool will be available by the end of the year as “part of our ongoing effort to protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy,” Facebook said. The web page will show only a list of accounts, not the posts or ads affiliated with them, according to a mock-up. U.S. lawmakers have separately published some posts.  It was not clear if Facebook would eventually do more, such as sending individualized notifications to users.  Lawmakers at congressional hearings this month suggested that Facebook might have an obligation to notify people who accessed deceptive foreign government material.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who had asked for notifications, said Facebook’s plan “seems to be a serious response” to his request.  “My hope is that it will be a responsible first step towards protecting against future assaults on its platform,” he said in a statement.  Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat, called it a “very positive step” and said lawmakers look forward to additional steps by tech companies to improve transparency.  "

2017-05-18,-16,"That law “prevents courts from entertaining civil actions that seek to impose liability on defendants like Facebook for allowing third parties to post offensive or harmful content or failing to remove such content once posted,” Garaufis wrote. Garaufis also dismissed a lawsuit by roughly 20,000 Israeli citizens who feared harm from future violence. He said they had no legal right to demand changes to Facebook’s platform because they could not show any “actual or imminent” injury. The decision is a setback to efforts to hold companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) liable for failing to better police users’ online speech. Robert Tolchin, a lawyer for both sets of the plaintiffs, said Garaufis appeared to sidestep limits under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act on aiding groups such as Hamas, a Palestinian group that the Department of State designates a foreign terrorist organization. “There is a clash between statutes that the court needed to reconcile but ignored,” Tolchin said in an interview. “We are planning to appeal because we see major errors in the decision.” In an email, Facebook said “there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families.” Congress passed the Communications Decency Act of 1996 to regulate online pornography. Garaufis said applications of that law in other contexts have arguably undermined incentives for internet service providers to remove content, but that it was enough for now to show that Congress’ “focus” was to limit liability. The Brooklyn lawsuits drew notice after Facebook’s law firm Kirkland & Ellis initially assigned a junior associate to represent the Palo Alto, California-based company, prompting Garaufis to ask if it took the matter seriously. Facebook quickly flew its deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, a former federal judge, from California to Brooklyn, where he assured Garaufis that the company had “a very serious interest in keeping terrorism content off” its platform. The cases are Cohen et al v. Facebook Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 16-04453; and Force et al v Facebook Inc in the same court, No. 16-05158. "
2017-05-18,-19,"U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn dismissed a $3 billion damages lawsuit by relatives of American victims of Hamas attacks, saying the federal Communications Decency Act regulating internet content immunizes Facebook from liability. That law “prevents courts from entertaining civil actions that seek to impose liability on defendants like Facebook for allowing third parties to post offensive or harmful content or failing to remove such content once posted,” Garaufis wrote.

2017-06-14,-3,"The fundraising tool in ""Safety Check"" will roll out in the coming weeks in the United States, Facebook said in a blog post. bit.ly/2rvr6AZ The social network, which has about 1.94 billion users worldwide, activated “Safety Check” for users in London on Wednesday following a fire in a housing block that killed at least six people and injured more than seventy. It also made the tool available earlier this month following deadly attacks on London Bridge. Facebook also said its “Community Help” feature, which helps people affected by disasters find each other locally to provide and receive assistance, would soon expand to include desktop users. "
2017-07-07,-6,"Tech companies have responded with measures such as internet-equipped buses for employees with long commutes. Facebook has offered at least $10,000 in incentives to workers who move closer to its offices.  Those steps, though, have not reduced complaints that tech companies are making communities unaffordable, and they have mostly failed to address the area’s housing shortage.  “The problem with Silicon Valley is you don’t have enough supply to keep up with the demand,” said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm CoreLogic.  With Facebook’s construction plan, the company said it wanted to invest in Menlo Park, the city some 45 miles (72 km) south of San Francisco where it moved in 2011.  The company said it wants to build a “village” that will also have 1.75 million square feet of office space and 125,000 square feet of retail space.  The 1,500 Facebook housing units would be open to anyone, not just employees, and 15 percent of them would be offered at below market rates, the company said.  Facebook said it expects the review process to take two years.  Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten Keith said in an interview that there were concerns about whether the Facebook plan would increase traffic, a subject the city’s planning department would study. She said, though, that Facebook’s plan fits with the city’s own long-term plan for development, and that the city was excited about the additional housing.  Facebook’s Tenanes said the density of the proposed development could also entice spending on transit projects.  “The region’s failure to continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure alongside growth has led to congestion and delay,” he said.  "
2017-05-16,-1,"A video carousel ad format shows images and links within a single ad unit and also has a button that directs users to websites. The company said it had fixed the bug, which was not found on the desktop version or the mobile app. The impact from a billing perspective was 0.04 percent of ad impressions, Facebook said. Facebook in September apologized for an error in the way it measured a key metric of video viewership that significantly amplified users’ viewing times on its platform. "
2017-05-16,-9,"The 150,000 euro fine is small in the context of the company, which has quarterly revenue of about $8 billion and a stock market capitalization which stands at around $435 billion. But it is the maximum amount the CNIL could fine when it started the investigation on the tech giant. The CNIL can now issue fines of up to 3 million euros, after the passing of a new law in October 2016. Last year, the French watchdog had given Facebook a deadline to stop tracking non-users’ web activity without their consent and ordered the social network to stop some transfers of personal data to the United States. Facebook argued that the Irish data protection authority, not the CNIL, was the competent authority to formulate such orders, as the social media company’s European headquarters are located in Dublin. “We take note of the CNIL’s decision with which we respectfully disagree,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to Reuters. “At Facebook, putting people in control of their privacy is at the heart of everything we do. Over recent years, we’ve simplified our policies further to help people understand how we use information to make Facebook better,” it said.   The French order was the first significant action taken against a company transferring Europeans’ data to the United States following an EU court ruling last year that struck down an agreement that thousands of companies, including Facebook, had relied on to avoid cumbersome EU data transfer rules. The transatlantic Safe Harbour pact was ruled illegal last year amid concerns over mass U.S. government snooping. EU data protection authorities said companies had three months to set up alternative legal arrangements for transferring data. A new EU data protection law is set to enter into force in 2018, which could see companies get fined up to 4 percent of their global turnover if they fall foul of the new regulation. "

Over recent years, we’ve simplified our policies further to help people understand how we use information to make Facebook better,” it said. The French order was the first significant action taken against a company transferring Europeans’ data to the United States following an EU court ruling last year that struck down an agreement that thousands of companies, including Facebook, had relied on to avoid cumbersome EU data transfer rules. The transatlantic Safe Harbour pact was ruled illegal last year amid concerns over mass U.S. government snooping. EU data protection authorities said companies had three months to set up alternative legal arrangements for transferring data. A new EU data protection law is set to enter into force in 2018, which could see companies get fined up to 4 percent of their global turnover if they fall foul of the new regulation. "

2017-10-11,1,"Facebook has invested heavily in virtual reality hardware in hopes the technology, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view of faraway or imaginary spaces, will move from a niche interest to a widely used platform for gaming, communication and business applications.  In 2014, Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees.  The Oculus Go is billed as simpler than the Rift, which went on sale last year, or the Vive system made by HTC Corp (2498.TW). Both of those require desktop computers to operate.  “I think you’re going to see these a lot on airplanes, because it’s way better than the back-of-the-seat monitor or my phone,” Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, said in an interview.  Schroepfer said the device is aimed at people who do not have Samsung smartphones. Oculus and Samsung Electronics Co 005939.KS already sell a device, named Gear VR, that when paired with certain Samsung phones is similar to Oculus Go.  Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) offers a rival headset, Google Daydream, that works with yet more smartphones. “The Oculus Go has potential to be a huge driver of growth,” if people like the titles and apps on it, Stephanie Llamas, vice president of research at Super Data, said in an email.  Facebook will permanently cut the price of the Rift system to $399 from $499, the company said.  Facebook is expected to ship 213,000 Rift systems this year, while HTC is expected to ship 305,000 Vive systems, according to Super Data research.  Beyond price cuts and new products, Facebook is trying different ways to attract people to the virtual-reality medium.  The company is developing software known as Facebook Spaces that allows friends to meet in virtual rooms, and it said it will soon integrate live video.  On Wednesday, the company said it was releasing technology to create better, customized facial images, or avatars, and would soon add the ability to use playing cards in Facebook Spaces, in addition to the dice it already has.

Sandberg’s visit to Germany comes after the country’s parliament passed a law in June to introduce fines of up to 50 million euros ($59 million) for social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly. On Wednesday - when Sandberg was attending a marketing conference in Germany - Facebook tightened its rules on who can make money from advertising on its network to make it harder for providers of fake news and sensational headlines to cash in. “We take our responsibility to the people who use our products, to the countries in which we work like Germany, to society at large, very seriously,” Sandberg said on Thursday. Sandberg announced that Facebook will join an urban mobility test project in Munich with carmakers and start-ups and said it will also sponsor a new university in Berlin focused on digital product development.

2017-04-26,-9,"In February, communist Vietnam complained about “toxic” anti-government and offensive content on Facebook and Google Inc.’s YouTube and pressured local companies to withdraw advertising until the social media firms found a solution. Facebook’s commitment came during a meeting between its Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert and Vietnamese information and communication minister Truong Minh Tuan in Hanoi on Wednesday, a statement on the government’s website said. “Facebook will set up a separate channel to directly coordinate with Vietnam’s communication and information ministry to prioritize requests from the ministry and other competent authorities in the country,” the statement said. The firm will also remove fake accounts and fake content about senior government officials, it said. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook’s website says that governments sometimes ask for the removal of content that violates local laws but does not violate its own Community Standards. “If after careful legal review we find that the content is illegal under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory,” it says. Vietnam’s government tolerates little dissent and human rights groups and western countries have criticised its arrest of anti-government bloggers. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to local agency Isobar Vietnam.

2017-09-13,-19,"The new standards coincided with an appearance by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in Germany, one of Facebook’s toughest critics on hate speech and safeguarding privacy.  Facebook, together with Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, accounts for around two fifths of internet advertising, which is forecast by consultancy Zenith to grow by 13 percent to $205 billion this year – overtaking television as the biggest channel for companies to pitch their wares to consumers. Marketing executives have criticized Facebook for failing to ensure that the digital ads distributed to its more than 2 billion active users reach their intended audience.  It has also drawn criticism from major advertisers for inflating its audience figures and not adequately tracking ads, which were sometimes placed alongside content detrimental to the brands being promoted.  On Wednesday, Facebook said it would seek accreditation from the Media Ratings Council, a U.S. non-profit organization, for audience measurement services. “We take very seriously our responsibility to earn and maintain the trust of people in businesses,” Sandberg told dmexco, a major digital marketing gathering in Cologne. “We hear their concerns about safe environments, about standards, about measurement, and this is critical to us,” she said. “We’re working hard to roll things out that give you more control over where your ads run, and more knowledge about where your ads run, before, during and after campaign.” Those publishing content flagged as misinformation or false news may be ruled ineligible to profit from Facebook, as would creators of clickbait and sensationalism, according to the rules seen by Reuters. Facebook’s guidelines for monetization give broad definitions of content that would be disallowed – including “family entertainment characters engaged in violent, sexualized, or otherwise inappropriate behavior”. Also covered are depictions of death, casualties and physical injuries in tragedies such as natural disasters; and content that is incendiary, inflammatory, demeaning or disparaging toward people or groups. Facebook said it will provide post-campaign feedback to advertisers that clearly identifies the publishers that ran their ads.  Facebook will also step up its monitoring of hate speech, adding 3,000 content reviewers to nearly double the size of its existing team, Senior Vice President for Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson said in a blog post. “As soon as we determine that content has breached our community standards, we remove it. With a community as large as Facebook, however, zero tolerance cannot mean zero occurrence,” she said. Germany has led the way in demanding action on hate speech. Its parliament passed a law in June to introduce fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) for social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly. "

Started in 2009, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for an eye-popping $22 billion in 2014.

2017-10-27,-8,"Details will include the size of spending and the demographics of the audience the ads reached, Goldman said. The archive, beginning with ads carried in 2018, will cover a rolling four-year period, he said.  Internet political ads have boomed in recent years as U.S. politicians looked for different ways to reach potential supporters, and as companies including Facebook have created tools to allow targeted marketing.  Online ads, though, are generally viewable only to the intended audience, raising concerns among transparency advocates, researchers and lawmakers about how to hold politicians accountable for what they say.  The planned archive reflects a change in corporate policy for the world’s largest social network, which had previously resisted the idea.  In June, Facebook told Reuters that it would go on treating political ads like all others and that creating an online repository would violate the confidentiality of those advertisers. Since then, Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have all said that Russia-based operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread politically divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow has denied interfering in the election.  Next week, general counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before public hearings of three U.S. congressional committees about the alleged interference and proposed legislation to require them to disclose election-related ads.  Goldman wrote in his post: “Transparency helps everyone, especially political watchdog groups and reporters, keep advertisers accountable for who they say they are and what they say to different groups.”  Facebook said its archive will eventually expand beyond the United States and show ads from elections in other countries and jurisdictions.  In the future, advertisers on Facebook will also be required to include a disclosure in election-related ads, to read: “Paid for by,” the company said. The announcement fleshes out ideas that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg outlined in September, as criticism of California-based Facebook built inside the United States over the Russian ads. The changes will test in Canada before being brought to the United States ahead of November 2018 elections, Facebook said.   Twitter took similar steps this week, saying it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind them, and it barred two Russian media outlets from running ads. "
2017-07-07,-6,"Tech companies have responded with measures such as internet-equipped buses for employees with long commutes. Facebook has offered at least $10,000 in incentives to workers who move closer to its offices.  Those steps, though, have not reduced complaints that tech companies are making communities unaffordable, and they have mostly failed to address the area’s housing shortage.  “The problem with Silicon Valley is you don’t have enough supply to keep up with the demand,” said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm CoreLogic.  With Facebook’s construction plan, the company said it wanted to invest in Menlo Park, the city some 45 miles (72 km) south of San Francisco where it moved in 2011.  The company said it wants to build a “village” that will also have 1.75 million square feet of office space and 125,000 square feet of retail space.  The 1,500 Facebook housing units would be open to anyone, not just employees, and 15 percent of them would be offered at below market rates, the company said.  Facebook said it expects the review process to take two years.  Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten Keith said in an interview that there were concerns about whether the Facebook plan would increase traffic, a subject the city’s planning department would study. She said, though, that Facebook’s plan fits with the city’s own long-term plan for development, and that the city was excited about the additional housing.  Facebook’s Tenanes said the density of the proposed development could also entice spending on transit projects.  “The region’s failure to continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure alongside growth has led to congestion and delay,” he said.

2017-09-26,-3,"That case set a precedent for the way foreign Internet firms operate in Russia and other companies are now under pressure from the regulator to comply with the law, which was approved by President Vladimir Putin in 2014 and entered into force in September 2015.  “Everyone needs to abide by the law,” the Interfax news agency cited Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov as telling reporters on Tuesday. “In 2018, everything will be as it should be for sure,” he said, referring to Facebook. “In any case, we will either get the law implemented or the company will cease to work on the territory of the Russian Federation as unfortunately happened to LinkedIn. There can’t be any exceptions here.” Twitter Inc had already notified Roskomnadzor that it would aim to localize the personal data of its users by the middle of 2018, Zharov said. “We understand clearly that Facebook has a significant number of users on the territory of the Russian Federation,” Zharov was cited as saying. “On the other hand, we understand that this is not a unique service, and that there are other social media.” Asked to comment on the regulator’s demands for Facebook to localize the data of its Russian users, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. firm had to comply with the law like everyone else.

2017-10-12,-5,"Although she parried certain sensitive questions about how much Facebook knew, Sandberg conveyed that it is troubled by the abuse on the system. She also made clear that divisive information would continue to be a part of its powerful newsfeed. If legitimate organizations had purchased many of the same ads, they would have run. The chief operating officer’s polish was a welcome display, especially after Zuckerberg’s knee-jerk reaction – followed much later by an apology – that it was crazy to think misinformation spread on Facebook might have affected the presidential vote. More broadly, Sandberg has been less visible on important public debates roiling the increasingly influential company. For example, Zuckerberg initially took the lead explaining how Facebook planned to be more open about political advertising and to work with legislators. Speaking on a live online stream dressed in a T-shirt gave a casual air that undercut the important message. Another botched video showed him breezily using virtual reality to visit devastated Puerto Rico. The Facebook founder’s nationwide listening tour also has been clumsy and led to growing speculation that he aspires to public office. Either way, he’s not faring especially well with this phase of 13-year-old Facebook. The intensity only will grow as U.S. and European authorities dig into how the company uses data to target advertising. Zuckerberg was smart enough to hire Sandberg from Google in 2008, back when only 66 million people were on Facebook and the company was still privately owned and valued at just $15 billion. It may be time to give her an even bigger role."

2017-11-22,-6,"Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are facing a backlash after saying Russians used their services to anonymously spread divisive messages among Americans in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. elections.  U.S. lawmakers have criticized the tech firms for not doing more to detect the alleged election meddling, which the Russian government denies involvement in.  Facebook says the propaganda came from the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that according to lawmakers and researchers employs hundreds of people to push pro-Kremlin content under phony social media accounts.  As many as 126 million people could have been served posts on Facebook and 20 million on Instagram, the company says. Facebook has since deactivated the accounts.  Facebook, in a statement, said it would let people see which pages or accounts they liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017 that were affiliated with the Internet Research Agency.  The tool will be available by the end of the year as “part of our ongoing effort to protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy,” Facebook said. The web page will show only a list of accounts, not the posts or ads affiliated with them, according to a mock-up. U.S. lawmakers have separately published some posts.  It was not clear if Facebook would eventually do more, such as sending individualized notifications to users.  Lawmakers at congressional hearings this month suggested that Facebook might have an obligation to notify people who accessed deceptive foreign government material.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who had asked for notifications, said Facebook’s plan “seems to be a serious response” to his request.  “My hope is that it will be a responsible first step towards protecting against future assaults on its platform,” he said in a statement.  Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat, called it a “very positive step” and said lawmakers look forward to additional steps by tech companies to improve transparency.  "
2017-05-10,-11,"Facebook said it wanted to downplay links that people post to websites that have a disproportionate volume of ads relative to content, or that have deceptive or sexually suggestive ads along the lines of “5 Tips to be Amazing in Bed” or “1 Crazy Tip to Lose Weight Overnight!”  Links to websites with pop-up ads or full-screen ads also would be downplayed, it said.  People scrolling through their News Feed are often disappointed when they click on such links and do not find valuable information, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of ads and business platform, said in an interview.  “People don’t want to see this stuff,” he said. “We’re just trying to figure out how to find it and rank it further down News Feed when possible.”  Facebook uses a computer algorithm to determine which posts people see first from friends and family, and it frequently refines the algorithm to keep up with spam or other concerns.  The company said in August it was adjusting the algorithm to downplay news stories with clickbait-style headlines, a style of headline that intentionally withholds information or misleads people to get them to click on them. In December, facing criticism that hoaxes and fake news stories spread too easily on Facebook in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, the company made it easier for people to report those kinds of posts. Facebook, the world’s largest social media network with 1.9 billion monthly users, has enormous power with its algorithms to potentially drive traffic to media publishers or stymie it. The company said it reviewed hundreds of thousands of websites linked to from Facebook to identify those with little substance but lots of disruptive or shocking ads. Bosworth declined to name any websites Facebook wants to target. He said only publishers of spam needed to worry about seeing less traffic, and other publishers could see their traffic go up. “This is a small number of the worst of the worst,” he said. "
2017-06-30,-6,"Facebook said the change would reduce the influence of a “tiny group” of people it has identified who share vast amounts of low-quality public posts daily. Only about 0.1 percent of people who share more than 50 posts a day fall into that category, the company said. The change would affect only links shared by those people, not their photos or other posts, the company said. “Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people’s feeds,” said Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s vice president for the News Feed, in a blog post.  Ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Facebook users saw false news reports saying Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook, which has 2 billion monthly active users, frequently tweaks the computer code behind the News Feed. The latest tweak will have a negligible effect, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who monitors social media, in a telephone interview, adding that Facebook needs to hire more content moderators. “Communications platforms used to employ a whole lot more humans, but what we’ve been led to believe now is that technology will solve everything,” Grygiel said.  In May, Facebook announced a change that would give lower prominence to links that lead to pages full of deceptive or annoying ads. A change in August was designed to deemphasize stories with clickbait-style headlines.  Friday’s change will de-prioritize links from specific spammers, Mosseri said. "

Russian authorities say the law, introduced in 2014, is aimed at protecting Russians’ personal data.  Critics, however, see its use as an attack on social media in a country that has tightened its control over the Internet in recent years.   Last year Roskomnadzor blocked access to LinkedIn to comply with a court ruling that found the networking service guilty of violating the same data storage law.

The initiative is one of several in Sao Paulo where major firms are making the most of a tech-savvy subculture — and a slump in the commercial real estate market — to create branded spaces for innovation in Latin America’s biggest business hub. Last week, Brazilian bank Itaú Unibanco Holding SA announced it was quadrupling its Cubo co-working space for tech startups, a joint investment with venture capital firm Redpoint eventures, which moves to a 12-floor building in Sao Paulo’s financial district in June 2018. Dzodan, who declined to say how much Facebook was spending on its new space, said the impact would be measured in participants rather than brick-and-mortar investments. “The maximum impact will come from training and education,” he said. “The multiplier effect of that is much greater than infrastructure.” "

The agency said it is advising all political parties on how to guard against cyber threats. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, said last week that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the site during a two-year period through May 2017. The company on Wednesday introduced tougher rules on who can make money from advertising on its network, responding to criticism that it was too easy to profit from fake news and sensational headlines. Facebook is launching the program in Canada as internet companies seek to fend off criticism they are not doing enough to thwart online interference with elections and politics.  “The spread of misinformation online can sway votes,” said Anatoliy Gruzd, an academic studying social media and politics at Ryerson University, who is slated to speak at the Facebook launch. “Platforms like Facebook and Twitter really need to put technical measures in place that would prevent the spread of fake information or the creation of groups that may promote hate speech,” Gruzd said. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) was expected to brief U.S. congressional investigators soon on whether Russia used its advertising platform to promote divisive social and political messages, a U.S. senator said last week. Google, which said last week it had seen no evidence of a Russian ad campaign on its platforms during last year’s U.S. election, earlier this year offered to defend election organizers and civic groups against cyber attacks free of charge.

2017-06-15,-10,"The world’s largest social media network, with 1.9 billion users, Facebook has not always been so open about its operations, and its statement was met with skepticism by some who have criticized U.S. technology companies for moving slowly.  “We’ve known that extremist groups have been weaponizing the internet for years,” said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth College computer scientist who studies ways to stem extremist material online. “So why, for years, have they been understaffing their moderation? Why, for years, have they been behind on innovation?” Farid asked. He called Facebook’s statement a public relations move in response to European governments.  Britain’s interior ministry welcomed Facebook’s efforts but said technology companies needed to go further. “This includes the use of technical solutions so that terrorist content can be identified and removed before it is widely disseminated, and ultimately prevented from being uploaded in the first place,” a ministry spokesman said on Thursday.  Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech.  Government officials have threatened to fine Facebook and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users.  Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda.  “More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves; that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,” Bickert said in a telephone interview.  Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said, “We’re talking about this because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.” Facebook’s blog post on Thursday was the first in a planned series of announcements to address “hard questions” facing the company, Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy and communications, said in a statement. Other questions, he said, include: “Is social media good for democracy?”  On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron launched a joint campaign to go after “terrorists and criminals” on the internet and to root out radicalizing material.  “Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content,” May said at a joint news conference.  Macron’s office declined to comment on Facebook’s statement on Thursday.  "
2017-08-14,-1,"Marketplace is being introduced this week in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Launched 10 months ago, Marketplace charges no fees to buyers or sellers and aims to make it easy for users to trade mostly second-hand goods, with the ability to post items for sale via smartphone or computer in less than 15 seconds.  Marketplace, already up and running in a handful of markets including the United States, Britain and Australia, is building on Facebook’s buy-sell groups. These draw in about 550 million monthly visitors, accounting for more than a quarter of Facebook’s 2 billion global users. “We want to make it easier to buy and sell, but we also want to make it community based,” said Deborah Liu, vice president of Facebook Marketplace. Prospective buyers can pick a radius for how far they wish to travel to collect purchases, but most transactions are local.    Marketplace restricts searches within national boundaries, mainly to avoid language confusion, Liu said. Facebook’s e-commerce push has yet to make any significant financial impact. The company posted a 45 percent rise in revenue to $9.3 billion in the past quarter, nearly 98 percent of which came from advertising on its free services. The low-key Marketplace service had 18 million items posted for sale in the United States in May, the company said, though it was unable to disclose how many items were sold because most transactions take place offline and are paid in cash. While not an exact comparison, eBay, which operates in more than 30 countries, counted 171 million active users who completed at least one transaction in the past quarter. "

And yet there’s so much demand for positions that the market can’t fill.” One in four Brazilians aged 18 to 24, most with more formal education than their parents, were unemployed at the start of the year, as the country’s worst downturn on record stunted the careers of a generation of young workers.

2017-05-11,-11,"Facebook said it wanted to downplay links that people post to websites that have a disproportionate volume of ads relative to content, or that have deceptive or sexually suggestive ads along the lines of “5 Tips to be Amazing in Bed” or “1 Crazy Tip to Lose Weight Overnight!”  Links to websites with pop-up ads or full-screen ads also would be downplayed, it said.  People scrolling through their News Feed are often disappointed when they click on such links and do not find valuable information, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice president of ads and business platform, said in an interview.  “People don’t want to see this stuff,” he said. “We’re just trying to figure out how to find it and rank it further down News Feed when possible.”  Facebook uses a computer algorithm to determine which posts people see first from friends and family, and it frequently refines the algorithm to keep up with spam or other concerns.  The company said in August it was adjusting the algorithm to downplay news stories with clickbait-style headlines, a style of headline that intentionally withholds information or misleads people to get them to click on them. In December, facing criticism that hoaxes and fake news stories spread too easily on Facebook in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, the company made it easier for people to report those kinds of posts. Facebook, the world’s largest social media network with 1.9 billion monthly users, has enormous power with its algorithms to potentially drive traffic to media publishers or stymie it. The company said it reviewed hundreds of thousands of websites linked to from Facebook to identify those with little substance but lots of disruptive or shocking ads. Bosworth declined to name any websites Facebook wants to target. He said only publishers of spam needed to worry about seeing less traffic, and other publishers could see their traffic go up. “This is a small number of the worst of the worst,” he said. "
2017-09-26,-3,"That case set a precedent for the way foreign Internet firms operate in Russia and other companies are now under pressure from the regulator to comply with the law, which was approved by President Vladimir Putin in 2014 and entered into force in September 2015.  “Everyone needs to abide by the law,” the Interfax news agency cited Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov as telling reporters on Tuesday. “In 2018, everything will be as it should be for sure,” he said, referring to Facebook. “In any case, we will either get the law implemented or the company will cease to work on the territory of the Russian Federation as unfortunately happened to LinkedIn. There can’t be any exceptions here.” Twitter Inc had already notified Roskomnadzor that it would aim to localize the personal data of its users by the middle of 2018, Zharov said. “We understand clearly that Facebook has a significant number of users on the territory of the Russian Federation,” Zharov was cited as saying. “On the other hand, we understand that this is not a unique service, and that there are other social media.” Asked to comment on the regulator’s demands for Facebook to localize the data of its Russian users, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. firm had to comply with the law like everyone else.

2017-11-21,-2,"Zharov said in September that Russia would block access to Facebook next year unless the social network complies with a law that requires websites which store the personal data of Russian citizens to do so on Russian servers. In November last year, Roskomnadzor blocked access to LinkedIn’s website in order to comply with a court ruling that found the social networking firm guilty of violating the same data storage law. "
2017-04-27,-7,"Facebook’s commitment came during a meeting between its Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert and Vietnamese information and communication minister Truong Minh Tuan in Hanoi on Wednesday, a statement on the government’s website said. “Facebook will set up a separate channel to directly coordinate with Vietnam’s communication and information ministry to prioritize requests from the ministry and other competent authorities in the country,” the statement said. The firm will also remove fake accounts and fake content about senior government officials, it said. A Facebook representative said the company had a clear and consistent process for governments to report illegal content. “We review all these requests against our terms of service and applicable law. We are transparent about the requests we receive from government and content we restrict pursuant with local law in our Global Government Requests Report,” the representative said in an emailed statement. The report shows no content restricted at the request of Vietnam’s government between July 2015 and June 2016, the latest period for which Facebook has published data. Vietnam’s government tolerates little dissent and human rights groups and western countries have criticized its arrest of anti-government bloggers. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to local agency Isobar Vietnam. Facebook has faced an unrelated challenge this week in nearby Thailand, where a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in a live video on Facebook that stayed on the platform for 24 hours before being removed.

2017-08-15,-4,"“This is an expected development, it will not change our strategy,” Chief Financial Officer Trond Berger told Reuters. Schibsted holds market-leading positions in local classified advertising websites across Europe including Norway’s Finn and France’s Leboncoin, and also has fast-growing operations in Asia, Africa and the Americas. “Facebook’s Marketplace has shown little effect on (competitors’) growth in the markets it has launched in the past,” Berger said. Schibsted’s biggest classified revenue streams come from services such as job adverts, car sales and real estate sales, and less from person-to-person trade in smaller items. “The generalist market means less to us income-wise, so we are not particularly concerned about our revenue flows,” the CFO said. He also said he did not expect an increase in costs to keep up with competition from the social network giant. Schibsted shares recovered some of their early losses and were down 5 percent at 1316 GMT. Analysts highlighted the rise in competition and worries over costs. “Overall, increased competition is negative, but the generalist market is only a minor part of Schibsted’s revenues,” Danske Bank Markets analyst Martin Stenshall said. “I think investors worry that Schibsted’s response could be to invest even more into its online classifieds to defend its position,” he added. Anders Skoe, chief executive of Schibsted’s Norwegian service Finn said Facebook’s entry was more likely to expand overall demand than to cannibalise existing players. About four percent of Finn’s revenues comes from the so-called the generalist market, Skoe said. Facebook’s Marketplace is being introduced this week in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Launched 10 months ago, Marketplace charges no fees to buyers or sellers and aims to make it easy for users to trade mostly second-hand goods. "
2017-07-26,0,"That could hurt given that nearly all of the company’s top line comes from selling ads to everyone from small businesses to global conglomerates. Mobile growth has been particularly strong, but it now generates 87 percent of advertising revenue, up 3 percentage points from a year earlier. Facebook’s 23 percent slice of the global digital mobile-advertising market trails Google’s 35 percent, according to research from eMarketer, which suggests some further growth potential. Yet there are small cracks on the surface that could turn into more troublesome gaps down the road. European trustbusters are eagerly going after the tech giants, slapping the search behemoth run by Sundar Pichai with a record $2.7 billion fine last month. Such action could spur U.S. legislators and regulators to give closer scrutiny to the two companies’ competitive advantages. Facebook isn’t standing still. Expenses were up 33 percent in the latest quarter and it’s investing aggressively. On a call with analysts Wednesday, Zuckerberg talked up the merits of artificial intelligence – a nod to his spat with Silicon Valley peer Elon Musk. Unlike the threat that the Tesla boss perceives in that technology, Zuckerberg sees the potential for AI to help flag fake stories in news feeds and help advertisers figure out which consumers would be most receptive to a pitch. By contrast, he barely mentioned virtual reality, three years after spending $2 billion to acquire Oculus. Google parent Alphabet is investing heavily in things like self-driving cars, and Amazon has turned cloud services into a big money maker. With Facebook near the top of its game, it should be looking harder for alternatives of its own."
2017-11-03,-5,"‘Whatsappdown’ was the top trending item on Twitter in India, which is WhatsApp’s biggest market with about 200 million of its billion-plus users. It was also a top trending item on Twitter in Pakistan, Britain, Germany and many other countries. Users reported WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging service, had begun to gradually function again about 30 minutes after initial complaints of an outage appeared on social media. A spokeswoman for Facebook in Singapore said the company was still investigating the matter. Independent websites monitoring outages of popular social media services via online conversations and Twitter messages report regular outages for WhatsApp, often one every few weeks, but these are typically brief and confined to certain geographies. WhatsApp has faced similar widespread outages this year, including for several hours in May. WhatsApp is used by more than 1.2 billion people around the world and is a key tool for communications and commerce in many countries. The service was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion. "
2017-11-02,-2,"The stock is up more than 50 percent this year and it hit a record high in regular trading on Wednesday, tempting investors who have profited from its run higher to cash in their gains. “Results were good for Facebook, but the forward spending is a concern,” Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh said. The social media giant reported a 79 percent surge in quarterly profit on Wednesday and revenues were up nearly 50 percent, showing just how insulated Facebook’s business remains from the political criticism of the company which has dominated recent months. At least 13 brokerages raised their price target on shares in the world’s largest social network following Wednesday’s quarterly results, with RBC Capital Markets making the most bullish move and raising its target by $35 to $230. The median price target was $208. “Yes, we take foreign meddling in U.S. elections very seriously. Call it what it is – political warfare. And countering will – and should – raise the cost of doing business for FB,” RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said. “But that business is inherently extremely impressive.” Facebook has faced criticism in Washington over its failure to prevent Russian operatives from using it for election meddling and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he would increase spending on security and double the 10,000 staff who review content on the network in response. The company said the spending would hit profits, with expenses overall expected to grow by between 45 and 60 percent next year. Of the four high-performing technology stocks beloved of investors this year, Facebook is a close second behind Netflix in performance, reflecting growing confidence in its model and power with advertisers.  The company continues to increase its more than 2 billion regular user base. Its two messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp, have more than 1 billion users each and the average price per ad rose 35 percent in the third quarter, Wednesday’s results showed. Barclays analyst Ross Sandler said the company “should have plenty of runway for years to come – and remains a core holding for any internet investor.”  "

Other new features include a rewind mode for videos, which will allow users to play video in reverse, and hashtag stickers to visit hashtag pages. Facebook has been amping up its camera tool to take on Snapchat’s features such as disappearing messages and face-tracking filters, which are hugely popular among its teenage and millennial users. The world’s largest social media network has already added several Snapchat-like features such as Stories, which allows users to upload pictures and video slideshows that disappear after 24 hours.

He offered no specific solutions to the problems he highlighted, but urged graduates to contemplate them. Today some 1.9 billion people use Facebook each month. Its broad reach has made the company a lightning rod for controversy, most recently for the ways that producers of fake news stories used it to influence public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and for a pair of incidents last month in which users posted videos of two murders, one of them live. Earlier in the day the website of the school’s student newspaper, The Crimson, was briefly filled with satirical headlines about Zuckerberg. The newspaper on Twitter apologized to its readers for the incident. Zuckerberg’s speech was not the first time a successful dropout returned to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to address graduates. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates spoke to graduates in 2007, shortly after saying that he would step away from his day-to-day role with the world’s largest software company to focus his time on philanthropy.

The world’s largest social media network has already added several Snapchat-like features such as Stories, which allows users to upload pictures and video slideshows that disappear after 24 hours. For now, Instagram does not have sponsored face filters, where advertisers can create their own content. Snapchat’s “sponsored lenses” have become a major part of its advertising revenue.  “If we’re being honest with ourselves, this is the way the tech industry works and frankly, it’s how all industries work,” said Instagram’s head of product Kevin Weil at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, when asked about the similarities between Instagram’s new features and Snap’s existing ones. “Kudos to Snapchat for being the first to Stories, but it’s a format and it’s going to be adopted widely across a lot of different platforms.” Instagram said in April over 200 million people used Stories daily.

2017-05-03,-7,"Instagram, with a visual canvas that’s attractive to brands, is probably part of the reason for the bump. The photo-sharing network has seen daily active users surge by 100 million over the past six months to 700 million. Facebook doesn’t break out Instagram’s advertising revenue though Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said Wednesday that the product is one of the most important mobile-ad platforms for the $440 billion firm, alongside the flagship. Executives renewed their warning of an ad slowdown, though. A pullback is likely as the company reduces the amount of advertising inventory in its network. Other concerns may eventually weigh on growth, including how Facebook handles violent content. Last month, it took the social network several hours to take down two videos, one chronicling a killing in Cleveland, Ohio, and another a murder-suicide in Thailand. Zuckerberg plans to almost double the number of staff keeping an eye out for questionable content, to 7,500. It’s unlikely to be the last such move. Members watched 100 million hours of video a day in early 2016, the last time Facebook disclosed that metric. That number has since grown since it launched live video later in that year. For now, Facebook’s road looks wide open as it pursues Zuckerberg’s goal of building its community of nearly 2 billion users. The company even embraced the idea that stock-option compensation should fully be counted toward its costs, and stopped reporting adjusted numbers. Yellow flags can’t dent the speed."
2017-04-17,-10,"U.S. authorities have widened a manhunt for the murder suspect who, according to police, posted a video of himself on the social media site shooting an elderly man in Cleveland. Police said they had received dozens of tips about the possible location of the suspect, Steve Stephens, and repeatedly suggested he turn himself in. The shooting was the latest violent incident shown on Facebook, raising questions about how the company moderates huge amounts of content uploaded from around the world. Facebook relies largely on its 1.9 billion users to report items that violate its terms of service. Millions of items are reported each week in more than 40 languages and thousands of workers review them, Osofsky said in the statement, posted on a company blog. “We prioritize reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,” Osofsky said. The company, which recently began to allow advertising breaks in live video streams, has also tried to automate the process for flagging offensive material. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook released a timeline of events related to Stephens, something it had not done after other violent incidents.  Stephens posted three videos, Facebook said. In the first, uploaded at 2:09 p.m. EDT on Sunday (1809 GMT), he said he intended to commit murder. No one reported it, according to Facebook.  Two minutes later at 2:11 p.m. EDT, Stephens uploaded a video of the shooting. And a third video, with a confession to murder, was broadcast live at 2:22 and reported by someone shortly after it ended at 2:27 p.m. EDT. The shooting video was not reported by Facebook users until 3:59 p.m. EDT and Stephens’ account was disabled at 4:22 p.m. EDT, Facebook’s timeline showed. “We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better,” Osofsky said.  "
2017-04-13,-13,"Facebook moderators removed some of reported images but left untouched pro-jihadist posts praising recent attacks and calling for new ones. The company appeared to take action only after The Times identified itself as reporting a story on the matter. Failure to remove content which is illegal under British law after company officials have been notified of its existence could expose Facebook to criminal prosecution for its role in encouraging the publication and distribution of such imagery. The social media giant faces new laws in countries around the world to force it to move faster to combat illegal content but it has struggled to keep pace as illicit posts can reappear as fast as they are identified and taken down. A Facebook spokesman said the company had now removed all the images identified by the Times as potentially illegal, acknowledging that they “violate our policies and have no place on Facebook”.  ”We are sorry that this occurred,“ Facebook Vice President of Operations Justin Osofsky said in a statement. ”It is clear that we can do better, and we’ll continue to work hard to live up to the high standards people rightly expect of Facebook.” A spokesman for London’s Metropolitan Police called for individuals to report extremist content to it via an online form. It declined to comment on whether it was investigating if Facebook failed to act when notified of the illegal content.  “Where material breaches UK terrorism laws, the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) will, where possible, seek the removal of the content by working with the relevant internet hosting company,” the spokesman said.

2017-04-19,-1,"Pokemon Go, jointly developed by Nintendo Co and Niantic Inc, has generated masses of followers around the world as players use their phones to capture animated characters that appear in real locations. Other uses of augmented reality have included the ability to hang out with a hologram of “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm or assemble a virtual human brain, all on mobile devices. A recent push by Facebook to add camera features to its suite of smartphone apps will help the company popularize similar features, Zuckerberg said.  “Even if we were a little slow to add cameras to all our apps, I‘m confident that now we’re going to push this augmented reality platform forward,” he said.  Zuckerberg said people could use the technology to leave a virtual note for a friend at a bar, or to find virtual street art on a wall that in real life is blank. Eventually, he said, people would use augmented reality on eyewear, although he did not give any details about possible Facebook hardware.  In 2014, Facebook acquired its Oculus virtual reality goggles unit for $2 billion, although that division is a long way from making a mass-market product or contributing significantly to the company’s earnings. As part of his conference address, Zuckerberg addressed shortcomings on another major project, Facebook’s push into video. He said the service needed to do more to prevent the spread of violent videos, such as one on Sunday of a fatal shooting in Cleveland that was visible on the site for two hours. "

2017-04-18,-9,"The world’s largest social network will be looking for ways to make it easier for people to report such videos and to speed up the process of reviewing items once they are reported, Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice president for global operations and media partnerships, said in a statement. U.S. authorities have widened a manhunt for the murder suspect who, according to police, posted a video of himself on the social media site shooting an elderly man in Cleveland. Police said they had received dozens of tips about the possible location of the suspect, Steve Stephens, and repeatedly suggested he turn himself in. The shooting was the latest violent incident shown on Facebook, raising questions about how the company moderates huge amounts of content uploaded from around the world. Facebook relies largely on its 1.9 billion users to report items that violate its terms of service. Millions of items are reported each week in more than 40 languages and thousands of workers review them, Osofsky said in the statement, posted on a company blog. “We prioritize reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,” Osofsky said. The company, which recently began to allow advertising breaks in live video streams, has also tried to automate the process for flagging offensive material. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook released a timeline of events related to Stephens, something it had not done after other violent incidents. Stephens posted three videos, Facebook said. In the first, uploaded at 2:09 p.m. EDT on Sunday (1809 GMT), he said he intended to commit murder. No one reported it, according to Facebook. Two minutes later at 2:11 p.m. EDT, Stephens uploaded a video of the shooting. And a third video, with a confession to murder, was broadcast live at 2:22 and reported by someone shortly after it ended at 2:27 p.m. EDT.

But we know we need to do better,” Osofsky said. "
2017-04-25,-3,"People could access the videos of the child’s murder on her father’s Facebook page for roughly 24 hours, until they were taken down around 5 p.m. in Bangkok (1000 GMT) on Tuesday, or about a day after being uploaded. Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of an elderly man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down. The harrowing footage from Thailand shows Wuttisan Wongtalay tying a rope to his daughter’s neck before dropping her from the rooftop of a deserted building in the Thai seaside town of Phuket. Wuttisan’s suicide was not broadcast but his lifeless body was found beside his daughter, said Jullaus Suvannin, the police officer in charge of the case. “He was having paranoia about his wife leaving him and not loving him,” Jullaus told Reuters. Reuters was unable to contact the mother of the dead child. Calls to her mobile number went unanswered. Television images showed her weeping and holding the dead baby. A regional Facebook representative in Singapore was not immediately available to comment. After the company faced a backlash for showing the video of the Cleveland killing, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would do all it could to prevent such content in the future. Thai netizens voiced outrage about the clips showing the child’s killing. “This is the most evil clip I’ve seen in my life,” said one user, Avada Teeraponkoon. “I couldn’t stand it for more than one second.” “How can he watch his own child stop breathing?” said another, Rujirek Polglang. “He should have just died alone.” The killing was the first in Thailand known to be broadcast on the social networking site, said Thai deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen. “It could be influenced by behavior from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,” Kissana told Reuters. Before they were taken down, the first video had drawn 112,000 views by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, while the second video showed 258,000 views.

2017-04-13,-4,"Facebook is under intense pressure in Europe as governments across the continent threaten new laws and fines unless the company moves quickly to remove extremist propaganda or other content that violates local laws. (reut.rs/2oBwHEO). The pressure on social media sites including Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Facebook has intensified in the run-up to the elections in France and Germany. Facebook already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users’ feeds. Also on Thursday, Facebook took out full-page ads in Germany’s best-selling newspapers to educate readers on how to spot fake news. U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. election last year in order to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Officials say a similar campaign is under way in Europe to promote right-wing, nationalist parties and undermine the European Union.  In a blog post, Facebook said it was acting against 30,000 fake accounts in France. It said its priority was to remove suspect accounts with high volumes of posting activity and the biggest audiences.  Two people familiar with Facebook’s process said the company had strengthened its formula for detecting deceptive accounts being run by automated means. As an example, the new process considers accounts that have smaller circles of friends and that therefore had been less of a priority previously. A key motivator was the need to get tougher on misinformation ahead of the French elections, the people said, although the move also targets accounts that generated spam for financial gain.   “We’ve made improvements to recognize these inauthentic accounts more easily by identifying patterns of activity — without assessing the content itself,” Shabnam Shaik, a Facebook security team manager, wrote in an official blog post. The company is using automated pattern-recognition to identify repeated posting of the same content and increases in messaging. Thursday’s action follows other moves by Facebook to make it easier for users to report potential fraud and hoaxes. "

(reut.rs/2oDqo6Z) These actions by Facebook follow moves the company has taken in recent months to make it easier for users to report potential fraud amid criticism of the social network’s role in the spread of hoaxes and fake news during the U.S. presidential elections.

2017-03-28,-2,"With an update scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, Facebook will allow users to get to the app’s camera with one swipe of their finger and then add visual details like a rainbow or a beard of glitter. Users will be able to share a picture privately with a friend, rather than to the user’s entire list of friends, and add a picture to a gallery known as a “story,” similar to a feature on the Snapchat app. Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc, popularized the sharing of digitally decorated photographs on social media, especially among teenagers, and exposed a weakness of Facebook as the companies battle for eyeballs and leisure time. Snap, which went public this month, has recently emphasized its ambitions to build gadgets and has called itself a camera company rather than a social media firm. Facebook, the world’s largest social network with some 1.86 billion users, denies it took its camera ideas from Snapchat and says it got them from Facebook users. “Our goal here is to give people more to do on Facebook and that’s really been the main inspiration,” Connor Hayes, a Facebook product manager, said in a briefing with reporters. In a glimpse of how the features could tie in with other businesses, one of the first camera effects will be the ability to morph someone in a photograph into a yellow, cartoon “Minion.” The latest Minion movie, “Despicable Me 3,” is due out in a few months from Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal. Facebook has deals to license content from six film studios, as well as from two artists, said Kristen Spilman, design director at Facebook. Another visual effect that can be added to pictures allows someone in a picture to “become a laser cat with super powers,” Spilman said. The effects will vary by location.

2017-03-27,1,"The company has found that one of the most used phrases on Messenger as people talk to friends and family is “How far away are you?” or some variation, Stan Chudnovsky, head of product for Messenger, said in an interview. “It happens to be what people are saying, what they’re interested in the most,” he said. Sharing location information is optional, but it can also be live, so that once a user shares the information with a friend, the friend can watch the user’s movement for up to 60 minutes. Messenger was once part of the core Facebook smartphone app, but the company broke it out as a separate app in 2014 and has since invested in frequent changes to build a service distinct from the massive social network.

2017-05-12,-21,"The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission said Facebook had failed to remove 131 of 309 web addresses on its platform which were threatened security or violated the lese  majeste law, which makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent.  They formed part of some 6,900 web addresses which Thai courts have ordered to be removed or shut down since 2015. Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of the commission, said he had given Facebook until Tuesday to remove the 131 addresses.  “If Facebook still shows content declared illegal by court orders in Thailand, action must be taken against Facebook Thailand,” Takorn told Reuters.  “They could argue that they are not involved (in removing content), but Facebook Thailand is still operating here.”  He said the Ministry of Digital Economy would file a complaint with police next week to press charges against Facebook Thailand under the Computer Crime Act and commerce ministry regulations. He also said obtaining a search warrant for Facebook Thailand would be a possible step.  Facebook has not responded to Reuters’ request for comment about the threat of legal action against Facebook Thailand. Facebook Thailand focuses on marketing and business developments in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy.  Facebook has said its general guideline when it receives requests from governments to remove content is to first determine whether the content violates local laws before it proceeds to restrict access in the relevant country.  Facebook said it blocked 50 pieces of content which were found to have violated the lese majeste law in 2016, following government requests. Thailand’s telecoms regulator has taken a tough stance against perceived criticism of the monarchy since Thailand’s revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October.  It has pressured internet service providers to monitor content and block anything inappropriate. Thailand considers the monarchy to be one of the guiding pillars of Thai society and above criticism or comment.  "

2017-10-01,-10,"The materials would be delivered on Monday, Facebook said on Sunday. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has become a primary platform for internet political ads because it has a wide reach and gives advertisers powerful targeting capabilities. For that reason, it may possess valuable clues for U.S. investigators. Facebook has already provided information about Russia-linked ads to U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating alleged election meddling, a source said last month. Moscow has denied any meddling in last year’s U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Facebook said on Sunday it would provide to Congress copies of the ads it has found, as well as related data such as whom the ads were targeted at and how much each ad cost. The materials would be turned over to the intelligence committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Facebook said. The $100,000 in ads linked to Russia focused on amplifying divisive U.S. social and political messages, Facebook said last month. Some ads mentioned Muslim support for Clinton, promoted in-person events and weighed in on the Black Lives Matter protests against police shootings, according to media reports. The emergence of Facebook as a battleground for government-sponsored propaganda has become a major challenge for the social network’s corporate image. Zuckerberg, in Facebook posts last month, disclosed a series of steps he said the company would take to prevent governments from manipulating it and said he had earlier been wrong to dismiss the possibility of Facebook being used in such a way. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, has likened digital political advertising to the “Wild, Wild West,” and he and others have called for legislation to impose disclosure requirements similar to what is required in the United States for political ads on television.

2017-05-21,-8,"Many of the company’s content moderators have concerns about the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies. Those on sexual content, for example, are said to be the most complex and confusing, the Guardian said. Facebook had no specific comment on the report but said safety was its overriding concern. “Keeping people on Facebook safe is the most important thing we do. We work hard to make Facebook as safe as possible while enabling free speech. This requires a lot of thought into detailed and often difficult questions, and getting it right is something we take very seriously”, Facebook’s Head of Global Policy Management Monica Bickert said in a statement. Facebook confirmed that it was using software to intercept graphic content before it went on the website, but it was still in its early stages.     The leaked documents included internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts, the Guardian said. The newspaper gave the example of Facebook policy that allowed people to live-stream attempts to self-harm because it “doesn’t want to censor or punish people in distress.”  Facebook moderators were recently told to “escalate” to senior managers any content related to “13 Reasons Why,” the Netflix original drama series  based on the suicide of a high school student, because it feared inspiration of copycat behavior, the Guardian reported. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents published on the Guardian website. "

2017-08-17,-2,"Facebook confirmed that the feature was in testing and said it was designed to help people discover stories that might be relevant to them.  The company makes frequent changes to the News Feed, typically testing potential features at length before making them official.  Facebook’s News Feed includes items posted by a user’s friends and family - displayed in an order according to Facebook’s algorithms - as well as ads and posts from outlets that a user likes. Many media companies, however, provide their subscribers with lists of stories that correspond to readers’ individual interests, based on their use of a news site. Presenting news stories has been tricky for Facebook.  In May 2016, Facebook changed the procedures behind its “Trending Topics” section after a news report alleged that the company had suppressed conservative news and a Republican U.S. senator demanded more transparency.  Facebook in December began rolling out a series of changes to stem hoaxes, clickbait and false news stories like those that spread ahead of last year’s U.S. presidential election.  Ahead of the election, Facebook users saw fake reports saying that Pope Francis had endorsed Republican Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. An array of other services, such as Twitter Inc and Snap Inc’s Snapchat, offer competing ways to find trending news.  Last month, Alphabet Inc’s Google overhauled its mobile search app to include a personalized feed of links.  "
2017-09-15,-5,"Some 2,300 people had expressed interest in the topics ”Jew hater,“ ”how to burn Jews“ and ”History of ‘why Jews ruin the world’,” according to ProPublica’s investigation. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, confirmed the ProPublica investigation. Once people put those phrases on their Facebook profiles, the anti-Semitic topics automatically migrated onto the company’s advertising platform, as if they were education or job data that would be useful to marketers, Facebook said. “We are removing these self-reported targeting fields until we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue,” Facebook said in a statement late on Thursday. “We want Facebook to be a safe place for people and businesses, and we’ll continue to do everything we can to keep hate off Facebook,” it said. Facebook initially responded to the ProPublica report by removing the topics in question from its ad system. However other news reports, including from Slate magazine, then discovered that hateful topics were more widespread in the ad system’s targeting capabilities. As Facebook has given advertisers greater power to micro-target their messages using a self-service platform, the company has at times failed to ensure they comply with its terms and conditions. Last year, ProPublica reported that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race when running housing or other ads, despite a prohibition on such ads under the U.S. Fair Housing Act 1969. Facebook said last week an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads promoting social and political messages over a two-year period through May, fueling concerns about foreign meddling in U.S. elections. The company said it shut down 470 “inauthentic” accounts as part of an internal investigation into those ads. Facebook and rival Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), dominate the fast-growing market for online advertising, in part because they let marketers target their ads based on huge volumes of data. Facebook reported $27.6 billion in 2016 revenue, the vast majority from advertising. Ad campaigns that used the anti-Semitic categories on Facebook were not widespread, the company said. “Given that the number of people in these segments was incredibly low, an extremely small number of people were targeted in these campaigns,” Facebook said. One change Facebook said it was considering was adding more thorough reviews of targeting categories before they show up in the self-service platform. "

2017-09-27,-6,"In a Facebook post on Wednesday Zuckerberg said both Trump and liberals were upset about ideas and content on Facebook during the campaign. “That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg said on Wednesday. Zuckerburg noted that the 2016 campaign was the first in the United States where the internet was a primary way candidates communicated and said the ability of candidates and voters to interact was a good thing. In the same post, Zuckerberg said he regretted saying after the election that it was “crazy” to think that misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election, adding that the comment was “dismissive.”  Earlier on Wednesday, Trump’s tweet criticized Facebook as “anti-Trump” and suggested the company could have colluded with other media outlets that opposed him.  Facebook is part of investigations both houses of Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller are conducting into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Facebook on Wednesday was asked to testify before two separate Congressional committees. It is not clear whether Zuckerberg or other executives will appear. "

2017-09-20,-6,"Sandberg said in a post on her Facebook page the company would have more manual review of the targeting options it gives advertisers, a change that she said would strengthen the system after a report Facebook had allowed advertisers to market to self-described “Jew haters.”  ProPublica, a non-profit news organization based in New York, reported last week that it was possible to buy Facebook ads targeted to people who, on their Facebook profiles, had listed anti-Semitic topics in their field of study or work.  Once people put those phrases on their Facebook profiles, the topics automatically migrated onto the company’s advertising platform, as if they were education or job data that would be useful to marketers. Facebook temporarily disabled some targeting capabilities last week in response to the ProPublica investigation.  Sandberg, who is Jewish, said in her post: “The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.”  Facebook should have discovered the unintended feature on its own, Sandberg added. The company would create a program to encourage people on Facebook to report potential abuses of its ads system directly to the company, she said.  U.S. lawmakers have separately criticized Facebook for allowing Russian operatives to buy U.S. political ads before and after the 2016 elections. Sandberg’s post did not mention the alleged Russian ads."
2017-10-19,-3,"It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.  While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers. Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access. Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from any subscriptions purchased, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.  Several major publishers have decided not to take part, largely because Facebook will not give access to reader data until they purchase a subscription.  An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy. “Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.” Britain’s Financial Times will not participate either, a source familiar with the matter said. The newspaper, which also charges for access to its articles online, wanted a registration process to get hold of reader data in exchange for free articles, said the source.  The New York Times Co (NYT.N) has yet to commit to the trial and is still in discussions with Facebook, a Times spokeswoman said, declining to give further detail. "
2017-07-03,-17,"In a decision late on Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California said the plaintiffs failed to show they had a reasonable expectation of privacy, or that they suffered any “realistic” economic harm or loss. The plaintiffs claimed that Facebook violated federal and California privacy and wiretapping laws by storing cookies on their browsers that tracked when they visited outside websites containing Facebook “like” buttons. But the judge said the plaintiffs could have taken steps to keep their browsing histories private, and failed to show that Menlo Park, California-based Facebook illegally “intercepted” or eavesdropped on their communications. “The fact that a user’s web browser automatically sends the same information to both parties,” meaning Facebook and an outside website, “does not establish that one party intercepted the user’s communication with the other,” Davila wrote. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Facebook did not immediately respond to a similar request. Davila said the plaintiffs cannot bring their privacy and wiretapping claims again, but can try to pursue a breach of contract claim again. He had dismissed an earlier version of the 5-1/2-year-old case in October 2015. The case is In re: Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 12-md-02314."
2017-11-09,-3,"Facebook disclosed in September that Russians bought ads on its platform in an attempt to divide Americans in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Russian government has denied meddling in the election. The company has responded by pledging to root out fake accounts and build a publicly searchable archive of ads related to elections, among other steps. Facebook named five of the 30 cities it will target for its advertising push: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Des Moines, Iowa; Greenville, South Carolina; Houston, Texas; and St. Louis.  Politicians including Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas are backing the effort, Facebook said.  Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google have come to dominate digital advertising with self-serve platforms that allow people to buy highly targeted ads based on data Facebook and Google collect about users.  That has come at the expense of traditional players such as newspapers, and it has spooked consumer advocates who are concerned about the rise of a duopoly. "
2017-06-23,-8,"Douez said her privacy rights under provincial law were violated, a growing concern among social media users in recent years who fear their personal information or photos will be used without their knowledge. The ads, which the company has since dropped, used Facebook members’ names and pictures to advertise companies and products to other members. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook had sought to suspend Douez’s lawsuit, saying that its terms of use require disputes to be resolved in the U.S. state. In a 4-3 decision, Canada’s Supreme Court ruled that the clause is unenforceable. The justices wrote that there was evidence of “gross inequality of bargaining power” between individual consumers and the company, given users have little choice but to accept Facebook’s terms of use. Canadian courts also have a greater interest in deciding cases that impinge on citizens’ rights “because these rights play an essential role in a free and democratic society and embody key Canadian values,” the court said. A spokesman for Facebook said the company continues to believe the underlying claims are without merit, and it will defend itself “vigorously”. British Columbia’s top court is better placed to rule on the province’s laws than a California court would be, the court said. Justices said their decision was also supported by the expense and inconvenience of having Canadians travel to California to sue Facebook being greater than any inconvenience the company would face in making its records available in British Columbia. A lower court had allowed Douez’s case to be considered as a group lawsuit, but the high court did not address the issue of class action status. Facebook reached a $20 million settlement in the United States in a class action lawsuit over the use of Sponsored Stories. The settlement was given court approval in 2013.  Facebook’s shares were up 0.4 percent at $154.09 in mid-day trade. "
2017-09-25,-7,"Speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that Russian operatives bought U.S. political ads on Facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.  “I think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self-regulation. Otherwise, I think regulation will be coming,” Brent McGoldrick, a political ad consultant and a Republican, said at Advertising Week New York.  Last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed $100,000 in Russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of U.S. social divides, the Washington Post reported on Monday.  Facebook shares ended down 4.5 percent on Monday, closing at $162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive. Zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.  Andrew Capone, senior vice president of NCC Media, a cable trade group, joked on Monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “Facebook took in over 300 million rubles - I‘m sorry, dollars.”  McGoldrick said on the panel: “If I were Facebook and Google and everyone else, I would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria. They may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.” Google has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a Russian propaganda campaign like the one Facebook found. The two Silicon Valley firms are set to take a combined 63 percent of the U.S. market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.  Though Facebook and Google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller have helped to change the situation, said Jefrey Pollock, president of public relations firm Global Strategy Group.  “Things change with a subpoena,” Pollock, a Democrat, said as part of the panel. "

2017-05-18,-4,"Calling it a “proportionate and deterrent fine”, the European Commission, which acts as the EU’s competition watchdog, said Facebook had said it could not automatically match user accounts on its namesake platform and WhatsApp but two years later launched a service that did exactly that. “The Commission has found that, contrary to Facebook’s statements in the 2014 merger review process, the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook and WhatsApp users’ identities already existed in 2014, and that Facebook staff were aware of such a possibility,” the Commission said. The fine would not reverse the Commission’s decision to clear the purchase of WhatsApp and was unrelated to separate investigations into data protection issues, it added.

2017-05-12,-21,"The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission said Facebook had failed to remove 131 of 309 web addresses on its platform which were threatened security or violated the lese  majeste law, which makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent.  They formed part of some 6,900 web addresses which Thai courts have ordered to be removed or shut down since 2015. Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of the commission, said he had given Facebook until Tuesday to remove the 131 addresses.  “If Facebook still shows content declared illegal by court orders in Thailand, action must be taken against Facebook Thailand,” Takorn told Reuters.  “They could argue that they are not involved (in removing content), but Facebook Thailand is still operating here.”  He said the Ministry of Digital Economy would file a complaint with police next week to press charges against Facebook Thailand under the Computer Crime Act and commerce ministry regulations. He also said obtaining a search warrant for Facebook Thailand would be a possible step.  Facebook has not responded to Reuters’ request for comment about the threat of legal action against Facebook Thailand. Facebook Thailand focuses on marketing and business developments in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy.  Facebook has said its general guideline when it receives requests from governments to remove content is to first determine whether the content violates local laws before it proceeds to restrict access in the relevant country.  Facebook said it blocked 50 pieces of content which were found to have violated the lese majeste law in 2016, following government requests. Thailand’s telecoms regulator has taken a tough stance against perceived criticism of the monarchy since Thailand’s revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October.  It has pressured internet service providers to monitor content and block anything inappropriate. Thailand considers the monarchy to be one of the guiding pillars of Thai society and above criticism or comment.  "

2017-05-18,-16,"That law “prevents courts from entertaining civil actions that seek to impose liability on defendants like Facebook for allowing third parties to post offensive or harmful content or failing to remove such content once posted,” Garaufis wrote. Garaufis also dismissed a lawsuit by roughly 20,000 Israeli citizens who feared harm from future violence. He said they had no legal right to demand changes to Facebook’s platform because they could not show any “actual or imminent” injury. The decision is a setback to efforts to hold companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) liable for failing to better police users’ online speech. Robert Tolchin, a lawyer for both sets of the plaintiffs, said Garaufis appeared to sidestep limits under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act on aiding groups such as Hamas, a Palestinian group that the Department of State designates a foreign terrorist organization. “There is a clash between statutes that the court needed to reconcile but ignored,” Tolchin said in an interview. “We are planning to appeal because we see major errors in the decision.” In an email, Facebook said “there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families.” Congress passed the Communications Decency Act of 1996 to regulate online pornography. Garaufis said applications of that law in other contexts have arguably undermined incentives for internet service providers to remove content, but that it was enough for now to show that Congress’ “focus” was to limit liability. The Brooklyn lawsuits drew notice after Facebook’s law firm Kirkland & Ellis initially assigned a junior associate to represent the Palo Alto, California-based company, prompting Garaufis to ask if it took the matter seriously. Facebook quickly flew its deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, a former federal judge, from California to Brooklyn, where he assured Garaufis that the company had “a very serious interest in keeping terrorism content off” its platform. The cases are Cohen et al v. Facebook Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 16-04453; and Force et al v Facebook Inc in the same court, No. 16-05158. "
2017-07-03,-18,"“We believe there are important First Amendment concerns with this case, including the government’s refusal to let us notify three people of broad requests for their account information in connection with public events,” Facebook said in a statement on Monday.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights including freedom of speech.  William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to comment.  Facebook decided to challenge the gag order around the three warrants because free speech was at stake and because the events underlying the government’s investigation were generally known to the public already, Facebook said in the undated court document.  The precise nature of the government’s investigation is not known. One document in the case said the timing of proceedings coincides with charges against people who protested President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  More than 200 people were arrested in Washington the day Trump was sworn in. Masked activists threw rocks at police, and multiple vehicles were set on fire.  Tech firms comply with thousands of requests for user data annually made by governments around the world, but in extraordinary circumstances, companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have challenged government secrecy orders.  Facebook recently fought a secrecy order related to a disability fraud investigation, losing in April in New York state’s highest court. Companies and privacy advocates argue that gag orders rely on outdated laws and are applied too often, sometimes indefinitely, to bar them from notifying customers about government requests for their private online data. Facebook says about half of U.S. requests are accompanied by a non-disclosure order prohibiting it from notifying affected users.  In April, a local judge in Washington denied Facebook’s request to remove the gag order there, according to the document. Facebook is appealing and has preserved the relevant records pending the outcome, the document said.  “The government can only insulate its actions from public scrutiny in this way in the rarest circumstances, which likely do not apply here,” said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights.  Facebook is getting support in court papers from several organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as eight tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in Washington for local matters, is scheduled to hear the case in September, according to an order obtained by BuzzFeed News, which first reported Facebook’s challenge to the gag order on Monday.

2017-10-02,-9,"Facebook said last month that it believed people in Russia bought about 3,000 politically divisive ads on its network in the United States in the months before and after the November U.S. presidential election. Since its disclosure, Facebook has faced questions and calls for increased U.S. regulation from U.S. authorities. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has outlined steps that the company plans to take to deter governments from abusing the social media network, the world’s largest. In a statement on Monday, Facebook said it would add more than 1,000 people over the next year and invest more in software to flag and take down ads automatically. “Reviewing ads means assessing not just the content of an ad, but the context in which it was bought and the intended audience - so we’re changing our ads review system to pay more attention to these signals,” the company said. Facebook said it had 17,048 employees at the end of 2016, excluding contractors. In May, it said it would hire 3,000 more people over the following year to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts that shocked users. Like other companies that sell advertising space, Facebook publishes policies for what it allows, prohibiting ads that are violent, discriminate based on race or promote the sale of illegal drugs. With more than 5 million paying advertisers, however, Facebook has difficulty enforcing all of its policies. The company said on Monday that it would adjust its policies further “to prevent ads that use even more subtle expressions of violence.” It did not elaborate on what kind of material that would cover. Facebook also said it would begin to require more thorough documentation from people who want to run ads about U.S. federal elections, demanding that they confirm their businesses or organizations.

2017-05-08,-5,"The case comes as legislators around Europe are considering ways of forcing Facebook, Google, Twitter and others to rapidly remove hate speech or incitement to violence.  Germany’s cabinet approved a plan last month to fine social networks up to 50 million euros ($55 million) if they fail to remove such postings quickly and the European Union is considering new EU-wide rules. Facebook’s lawyers in Vienna declined to comment on the ruling, which was distributed by the Greens and confirmed by a court spokesman, and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  The court added it was easy for Facebook to automate this process. It said, however, that Facebook could not be expected to trawl through content to find posts that are similar, rather than identical, to ones already identified as hate speech.     The Greens hope to get the ruling strengthened further at Austria’s highest court. They want the court to demand Facebook remove similar - not only identical - postings, and to make it identify holders of fake accounts. The Greens also want Facebook to pay damages, which would make it easier for individuals in similar cases to take the financial risk of taking legal action.  “Facebook must put up with the accusation that it is the world’s biggest platform for hate and that it is doing nothing against this,” said Green parliamentarian Dieter Brosz. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said hate speech has no place on the platform and the company has published a policy paper on how it wants to work against false news."

2017-09-27,-6,"In a Facebook post on Wednesday Zuckerberg said both Trump and liberals were upset about ideas and content on Facebook during the campaign. “That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg said on Wednesday. Zuckerburg noted that the 2016 campaign was the first in the United States where the internet was a primary way candidates communicated and said the ability of candidates and voters to interact was a good thing. In the same post, Zuckerberg said he regretted saying after the election that it was “crazy” to think that misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election, adding that the comment was “dismissive.”  Earlier on Wednesday, Trump’s tweet criticized Facebook as “anti-Trump” and suggested the company could have colluded with other media outlets that opposed him.  Facebook is part of investigations both houses of Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller are conducting into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Facebook on Wednesday was asked to testify before two separate Congressional committees. It is not clear whether Zuckerberg or other executives will appear. "

2017-09-20,-6,"Sandberg said in a post on her Facebook page the company would have more manual review of the targeting options it gives advertisers, a change that she said would strengthen the system after a report Facebook had allowed advertisers to market to self-described “Jew haters.”  ProPublica, a non-profit news organization based in New York, reported last week that it was possible to buy Facebook ads targeted to people who, on their Facebook profiles, had listed anti-Semitic topics in their field of study or work.  Once people put those phrases on their Facebook profiles, the topics automatically migrated onto the company’s advertising platform, as if they were education or job data that would be useful to marketers. Facebook temporarily disabled some targeting capabilities last week in response to the ProPublica investigation.  Sandberg, who is Jewish, said in her post: “The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.”  Facebook should have discovered the unintended feature on its own, Sandberg added. The company would create a program to encourage people on Facebook to report potential abuses of its ads system directly to the company, she said.  U.S. lawmakers have separately criticized Facebook for allowing Russian operatives to buy U.S. political ads before and after the 2016 elections. Sandberg’s post did not mention the alleged Russian ads."

2017-10-04,0,"Wisconsin and Michigan were among the handful of battleground states that helped Trump win the presidency over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and Michigan by 10,700 votes. About 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on Facebook which were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the U.S. election, Facebook said on Monday as social media companies face calls for increased regulation and more transparency to open up the opaque world of online political ads. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees are investigating possible links between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Russia denies meddling in the election. A representative from Facebook could not be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  "
2017-09-05,0,"Cricket is the most popular sport in India and the IPL is watched by more than a billion people worldwide. The tournament began in 2008 with franchise owners including movie stars and India’s richest man. The bid by Facebook also highlights the company’s efforts to accelerate its push into video as it tries to take advertising dollars from television and increase the time people spend on its platform. Facebook currently offers live video from a number of news publishers as well as its users. “(Facebook’s bid) is still significant because it’s such a large amount of money in a market that’s still nascent,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. “It clarifies that they intend to be a real player in traditional premium video content.” With a cash pile of $6.25 billion, Facebook will have even more shots at bidding for live sporting events as it seeks to keep people glued to its expanding media network. Facebook kicked off live-streaming sports events about a year ago with a soccer match between Manchester United and Everton. It has since streamed basketball, baseball and more soccer matches. Another significant deal for Facebook was its agreement with Major League Baseball in May to live-stream 20 games this season. However, the social network lost out to Amazon.com Inc in April for the highly coveted rights to stream 10 U.S. National Football League (NFL) games this year. Amazon agreed to pay the NFL five times the amount Twitter Inc had spent on the rights last year, which was reported to be $10 million, a source told Reuters at the time. Facebook was also competing with Twitter and Snapchat parent Snap Inc to score the online rights to video highlights from Fox for next year’s soccer World Cup, Bloomberg reported in July. Facebook might also eye other big events such as the Olympics or the soccer World Cup, the world’s most viewed sports event, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. "
2017-09-14,-5,"ProPublica, a nonprofit outlet based in New York, said it found the topics in Facebook’s self-service ad-buying platform and paid $30 to test them with its own content. Another category it found was “History of ‘why Jews ruin the world.'” The anti-Semitic categories were created by an algorithm rather than by people, ProPublica reported. Some 2,300 people had expressed interest in them. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, said in a statement that it had removed the ability to buy targeted marketing based on those topics and believed the use of the topics in ad campaigns had not been widespread. Along with Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook dominates the fast-growing market for online advertising, in part because it lets marketers target their ads based on huge volumes of data. Facebook, though, has had difficulty ensuring that advertisers on its self-service system comply with its terms and conditions. Last year, ProPublica reported that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race when running housing or other ads, despite a prohibition on such ads under the U.S. Fair Housing Act 1969. Facebook last week said an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads promoting social and political messages over a two-year period through May, fueling concerns about foreign meddling in U.S. elections. The company said it shut down 470 “inauthentic” accounts as part of an internal investigation into those ads. The anti-Semitic targeting categories likely were generated because people listed those themes on their Facebook profiles as an interest, an employer or field of study, ProPublica reported. Rob Leathern, product management director at Facebook, said in a statement on Thursday that sometimes content appears on the network that “violates our standards.” “In this case,” he went on, “we’ve removed the associated targeting fields in question. We know we have more work to do, so we’re also building new guardrails in our product and review processes to prevent other issues like this from happening in the future.” Facebook said it was considering other changes to its advertising platform, such as adding more reviews of targeting categories before they show up in the self-service platform. "
2017-09-06,-4,"Facebook’s ad-buying website tells advertisers that the world’s largest social network has a potential reach of 41 million 18 to 24 year olds in the United States, whereas U.S. census data shows that last year there were 31 million people living in the country between these ages, Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research Group senior analyst, said in a note. The gap persists for 25 to 34 year olds and is not widely known among ad agency executives, Wieser wrote in the client note, adding that the gap may cause large advertisers to step up demands for third-party measurement services. Wieser, unlike most stock analysts, maintains a “sell” rating on Facebook’s shares. People on Facebook self-report their ages, so these may also vary from census data. The company also uses location data from mobile devices to estimate its reach, meaning that it counts tourists and other visitors. Some 5.6 million non-residents visited the United States in January, the most recent month for which the U.S. Commerce Department publishes data. Last year, Facebook apologized to advertisers after finding that the average time users spent viewing online ads had been artificially inflated, because it was counting only videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a “view.”  In November, Facebook launched a blog called Metrics FYI to share updates and corrections for its data. “While Facebook’s measurement issues won’t necessarily deter advertisers from spending money with Facebook, they will help traditional TV sellers justify existing budget shares and could restrain Facebook’s growth in video ad sales on the margins,” Wieser said. "
2017-07-03,-17,"Facebook said it wants to notify three users about the search warrants seeking their communications and information and also give those users an opportunity to object to the warrants, according to a filing in a Washington, D.C., appeals court seen by Reuters. “We believe there are important First Amendment concerns with this case, including the government’s refusal to let us notify three people of broad requests for their account information in connection with public events,” Facebook said in a statement on Monday. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights including freedom of speech. William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to comment. Facebook decided to challenge the gag order around the three warrants because free speech was at stake and because the events underlying the government’s investigation were generally known to the public already, Facebook said in the undated court document. The precise nature of the government’s investigation is not known. One document in the case said the timing of proceedings coincides with charges against people who protested President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. More than 200 people were arrested in Washington the day Trump was sworn in. Masked activists threw rocks at police, and multiple vehicles were set on fire. Tech firms comply with thousands of requests for user data annually made by governments around the world, but in extraordinary circumstances, companies such as Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc have challenged government secrecy orders. Facebook recently fought a secrecy order related to a disability fraud investigation, losing in April in New York state’s highest court. Companies and privacy advocates argue that gag orders rely on outdated laws and are applied too often, sometimes indefinitely, to bar them from notifying customers about government requests for their private online data. Facebook says about half of U.S. requests are accompanied by a non-disclosure order prohibiting it from notifying affected users. In April, a local judge in Washington denied Facebook’s request to remove the gag order there, according to the document. Facebook is appealing and has preserved the relevant records pending the outcome, the document said. “The government can only insulate its actions from public scrutiny in this way in the rarest circumstances, which likely do not apply here,” said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights. Facebook is getting support in court papers from several organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as eight tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in Washington for local matters, is scheduled to hear the case in September, according to an order obtained by BuzzFeed News, which first reported Facebook’s challenge to the gag order on Monday."
2017-05-16,-9,"The 150,000 euro fine is small in the context of the company, which has quarterly revenue of about $8 billion and a stock market capitalization which stands at around $435 billion. But it is the maximum amount the CNIL could fine when it started the investigation on the tech giant. The CNIL can now issue fines of up to 3 million euros, after the passing of a new law in October 2016. Last year, the French watchdog had given Facebook a deadline to stop tracking non-users’ web activity without their consent and ordered the social network to stop some transfers of personal data to the United States. Facebook argued that the Irish data protection authority, not the CNIL, was the competent authority to formulate such orders, as the social media company’s European headquarters are located in Dublin. “We take note of the CNIL’s decision with which we respectfully disagree,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to Reuters. “At Facebook, putting people in control of their privacy is at the heart of everything we do. Over recent years, we’ve simplified our policies further to help people understand how we use information to make Facebook better,” it said.   The French order was the first significant action taken against a company transferring Europeans’ data to the United States following an EU court ruling last year that struck down an agreement that thousands of companies, including Facebook, had relied on to avoid cumbersome EU data transfer rules. The transatlantic Safe Harbour pact was ruled illegal last year amid concerns over mass U.S. government snooping. EU data protection authorities said companies had three months to set up alternative legal arrangements for transferring data. A new EU data protection law is set to enter into force in 2018, which could see companies get fined up to 4 percent of their global turnover if they fall foul of the new regulation. "

AEPD said it found three cases in which Facebook had collected details such as the gender, religious beliefs, personal tastes and browsing history of its millions of Spanish users without informing them how such information would be used. Facebook did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. According to the AEPD, the tech giant did not sufficiently inform users about how it would use data collected on third-party websites, and did not obtain consent to use it. “Facebook’s privacy policy contains generic and unclear terms,” the authority said in a statement.  “The social network uses specifically protected data for advertising, among other purposes, without obtaining users’ express consent as data protection law demands, a serious infringement.”   Using cookies, Facebook also collects data from people who do not have an account on the social network but navigate other pages containing a “like” button, AEPD said. Facebook users’ activity can also be tracked on third-party sites, and the information collected added to what is already associated with a Facebook account, AEPD said. It said it also found evidence the network kept information for more than 17 months after users closed their accounts.  "
2017-05-31,-2,"The former Democratic candidate said earlier this month that interference by Russian hackers and then-FBI director James Comey helped tip the election to Republican President Donald Trump.

A representative for Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said just after the November election that it was “crazy” to think that fake news on the site had influenced the election in any way.

2017-10-02,-18,"The ads have sparked anger toward Facebook and, within the United States, toward Russia since the world’s largest social network disclosed their existence last month. Moscow has denied involvement with the ads.  Facebook has faced calls for increased U.S. regulation from U.S. authorities. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has outlined steps that the company plans to take to deter governments from abusing the social media network. Earlier on Monday, Facebook said in a separate statement that it planned to hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms, as part of an effort to deter Russia and other countries from using the platform to interfere in elections. The latest company statement said that about 25 percent of the ads were never shown to anyone.  “That’s because advertising auctions are designed so that ads reach people based on relevance, and certain ads may not reach anyone as a result,” Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of policy and communications, said in the statement. For 99 percent of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent, he said. The total ad spend was $100,000, the company has said.  Still, he said it was possible Facebook would find more Russia-linked U.S. ads as it continues to investigate.  Schrage, while criticizing the ad buyers for using fake accounts, also said many of the ads otherwise “did not violate our content policies” and could have remained if bought using real accounts.  “While we may not always agree with the positions of those who would speak on issues here, we believe in their right to do so - just as we believe in the right of Americans to express opinions on issues in other countries,” he wrote. Facebook is working with others in the tech sector, including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, on investigating alleged Russian election meddling, Schrage added. The 1,000 new workers represent the second time this year that Facebook has responded to a crisis by announcing a hiring spree. In May, it said it would hire 3,000 more people to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts that shocked users.  Like other companies that sell advertising space, Facebook publishes policies for what it allows, prohibiting ads that are violent, discriminate based on race or promote the sale of illegal drugs.

2017-06-21,1,"Facebook currently operates in Indonesia through an office in central Jakarta. “I see good intention and spirit from Facebook,” said Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia’s investment coordinating board. “What we care about are taxes and responsible content.” The investment board and the communications ministry are currently looking at the type of business unit that Facebook will establish, Lembong said. There are several ways to be locally incorporated in the country, including setting up a limited liability company, locally known as a PT (Perseroan Terbatas).  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
2017-09-12,-1,"Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on its spending. Facebook’s Watch was rolled out to U.S. users last month. The company has initially been paying for a handful of shows to attract viewers to the platform. It has paid $10,000 to $35,000 for shorter-form shows and up to $250,000 for some longer-scripted shows, sources told Reuters in May. “We think we have a big hit on our hands,” said Rory Brown, president of Bleacher Report, declining to comment on how many millions Facebook is paying Bleacher Report for the show. “People are going to spend more time on Facebook because of it.”  “No Script” will start streaming this month and consists of eight 10- to 15-minute episodes featuring various antics by Lynch, who is returning to football as a running back for the Raiders. The first episode features Lynch taking racecar driving lessons until he ruins the tires of the car. In a deal similar to others, Facebook retains exclusive rights to the show for a period of time, Brown said, declining to elaborate on the exclusivity window. After that period Bleacher Report owns the content and can use it.  It was a big priority for Bleacher Report to keep the show authentic, given Lynch’s raw style, Brown said. For the most part Facebook gave Bleacher Report full creative control, however the social media network does have concerns about offensive language, Brown said. “I wouldn’t be shocked if that ends up being censored,” he said.

2017-10-01,-10,"The materials would be delivered on Monday, Facebook said on Sunday. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has become a primary platform for internet political ads because it has a wide reach and gives advertisers powerful targeting capabilities. For that reason, it may possess valuable clues for U.S. investigators. Facebook has already provided information about Russia-linked ads to U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating alleged election meddling, a source said last month. Moscow has denied any meddling in last year’s U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Facebook said on Sunday it would provide to Congress copies of the ads it has found, as well as related data such as whom the ads were targeted at and how much each ad cost. The materials would be turned over to the intelligence committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Facebook said. The $100,000 in ads linked to Russia focused on amplifying divisive U.S. social and political messages, Facebook said last month. Some ads mentioned Muslim support for Clinton, promoted in-person events and weighed in on the Black Lives Matter protests against police shootings, according to media reports. The emergence of Facebook as a battleground for government-sponsored propaganda has become a major challenge for the social network’s corporate image. Zuckerberg, in Facebook posts last month, disclosed a series of steps he said the company would take to prevent governments from manipulating it and said he had earlier been wrong to dismiss the possibility of Facebook being used in such a way. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, has likened digital political advertising to the “Wild, Wild West,” and he and others have called for legislation to impose disclosure requirements similar to what is required in the United States for political ads on television. "
2017-08-31,1," On Watch, which Facebook began testing earlier this month, more than 2 billion users can see hundreds of shows from the likes of Vox, Buzzfeed, Discovery Communications, Walt Disney & Co’s ABC as well as live sports like Major League Baseball. Americans are spending over 73 minutes per day watching digital video, up more than 7 percent from last year, according to eMarketer data. TV watching has dropped 2 percent from last year to 244 minutes a day, a trend that is expected to continue. Facebook is initially paying content creators for shows to drive interest. The company is paying $10,000-$35,000 for shorter form shows and up to $250,000 for longer form scripted shows, sources told Reuters in May.  The company declined to comment on how much it is spending on shows. Facebook plans to eventually open the platform to everyone to submit shows for approval and share 55 percent of ad revenue, said Dan Rose, vice president of partnerships at Facebook, in an interview. Facebook is testing how ads will work within the shows, he added. Over the past few years, Facebook has been gaining on YouTube, the leader in the digital video space, in terms of winning over advertisers, and Watch should help solidify its position, said Paul Verna, a senior analyst with eMarketer. Facebook said Watch is more personal and community-oriented than competitors. For example, it can suggest shows based on a user’s interests and friends can share their thoughts as they watch a video, or participate in groups dedicated to a show.  “We think our unique opportunity is around community and engaging with people on topics they love to talk about,” said Rose. For example, fans of the exercise program “CrossFit” can watch and share commentary on live CrossFit events streamed on Facebook while chatting in groups, Rose said.    "

2017-10-19,-3,"It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.  While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers. Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access. Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from any subscriptions purchased, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.  Several major publishers have decided not to take part, largely because Facebook will not give access to reader data until they purchase a subscription.  An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy. “Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.” Britain’s Financial Times will not participate either, a source familiar with the matter said. The newspaper, which also charges for access to its articles online, wanted a registration process to get hold of reader data in exchange for free articles, said the source.  The New York Times Co (NYT.N) has yet to commit to the trial and is still in discussions with Facebook, a Times spokeswoman said, declining to give further detail. "
2017-08-10,0,"The world’s largest social network added a video tab last year, and it has been dropping hints for months that it wanted to become a source of original and well-produced videos, rather than just shows made by users.  Reuters reported in May that Facebook had signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators Vox Media, BuzzFeed, ATTN, Group Nine Media and others to produce shows, both scripted and unscripted.  “We’ve learned that people like the serendipity of discovering videos in News Feed, but they also want a dedicated place they can go to watch videos,” Daniel Danker, Facebook’s product director, said in a statement on Wednesday. Facebook said the shows would include videos of the Women’s National Basketball Association, a parenting show from Time Inc and a safari show from National Geographic. Facebook is already broadcasting some Major League Baseball games and that would continue, the company said.  ATTN said on Wednesday it had two original series coming to Facebook Watch: a health program with actress Jessica Alba and a relationship advice show.  Eventually, the platform would be open to any show creator as a place to distribute video, Facebook said.  The company, based in Menlo Park, California, faces a crowded market with not only traditional television networks but newer producers such as Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube as well as Twitter Inc and Snap Inc.  "
2017-07-27,1,"Facebook, which now has more than 2 billion regular users, has been squeezing more ads into its Facebook News Feed while adding more ads to its photo-sharing app Instagram, which has more than 700 million users. With money cascading from those two services, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company was turning attention to monetizing its two messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp, which have more than 1 billion users each. “I want to see us move a little faster here but I‘m confident that we’re going to get this right over the long term,” Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. The company also is accelerating its push into video, an effort aimed at taking advertising dollars from the television industry and increasing the time people spend on Facebook. Within weeks, Facebook is expected to start a video service that will include scripted shows, a sharp change for a business built on user-generated content.   Zuckerberg said video would be a significant driver of Facebook’s business in the next two to three years. With those possibilities still on the horizon, Facebook said  total revenue rose 44.8 percent to $9.32 billion in the second quarter of the year. That beat the average forecast of $9.20 billion among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Growth was even steeper in mobile advertising, which increased to nearly $8 billion. “In mobile we’re continuing to see great strengths,” Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a phone interview with Reuters. “We’re seeing more and more ad dollars getting allocated to mobile, and we think that trend will continue.” “KILLING IT ON MOBILE” “They’re killing it on mobile,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said, referring to Facebook’s suite of apps. “They are the de facto mobile advertising monopolies and that’s a really big deal.” Martin said she sees no weaknesses in Facebook’s business. Facebook and Alphabet Inc own half of the online advertising market worldwide, and Facebook’s revenue growth this quarter outshone Alphabet, the owner of YouTube and Google.  Alphabet on Monday reported a 21 percent increase in quarterly revenue, although it started the quarter from a larger base than Facebook did. Facebook has not said how much of its revenue is attributable to its Instagram unit, although the photo-sharing app has become a greater focus of its business.  “Clearly, the biggest driver of growth is, overall, Facebook News Feed,” Wehner said. “Instagram is making a contribution and an increasing contribution.” But investors want Facebook to find additional revenue streams because the company has warned it is hitting maximum ad load in the News Feed, potentially slowing its overall growth.  So far that has not happened. “They kept warning about ad load, but the ad load continues to be strong,” said Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial Partners. “I still think ad revenue will grow, because more advertisers are adapting to this platform because there are so many people out there.” The popularity of Instagram also has put pressure on Snapchat, the app owned by Snap Inc. Instagram has added features similar to Snapchat’s and Snap’s stock on Wednesday closed at an all-time low of $13.40.  Facebook said about 2.01 billion people were using its service monthly as of June 30, up 17 percent from a year earlier. For the second quarter, net income attributable to shareholders rose to $3.89 billion, or $1.32 per share, from $2.28 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.13 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "
2017-05-18,0,"Reuters reported in February that Facebook and MLB were in talks to stream one game per week as part of an aggressive push to become a destination for live sports.  Rival U.S. internet firms are racing for similar programming. Twitter Inc announced an agreement this month with the WNBA to show professional women’s basketball, and last month Amazon.com Inc said it would stream men’s professional football in a deal with the NFL.  For the baseball broadcast, Facebook said it will use a feed from a participating team’s local broadcast rightsholder.  “Baseball games are uniquely engaging community experiences, as the chatter and rituals in the stands are often as meaningful to fans as the action on the diamond,” Dan Reed, Facebook’s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. “By distributing a live game per week on Facebook, Major League Baseball can re-imagine this social experience on a national scale,” he said. Facebook says it has some 182 million daily active users in the United States and Canada.  "
2017-07-03,-11,"The plaintiffs claimed that Facebook violated federal and California privacy and wiretapping laws by storing cookies on their browsers that tracked when they visited outside websites containing Facebook “like” buttons. But the judge said the plaintiffs could have taken steps to keep their browsing histories private, and failed to show that Menlo Park, California-based Facebook illegally “intercepted” or eavesdropped on their communications. “The fact that a user’s web browser automatically sends the same information to both parties,” meaning Facebook and an outside website, “does not establish that one party intercepted the user’s communication with the other,” Davila wrote. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Facebook did not immediately respond to a similar request. Davila said the plaintiffs cannot bring their privacy and wiretapping claims again, but can try to pursue a breach of contract claim again. He had dismissed an earlier version of the 5-1/2-year-old case in October 2015. The case is In re: Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 12-md-02314. "
2017-11-09,-3,"Facebook disclosed in September that Russians bought ads on its platform in an attempt to divide Americans in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Russian government has denied meddling in the election. The company has responded by pledging to root out fake accounts and build a publicly searchable archive of ads related to elections, among other steps. Facebook named five of the 30 cities it will target for its advertising push: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Des Moines, Iowa; Greenville, South Carolina; Houston, Texas; and St. Louis.  Politicians including Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas are backing the effort, Facebook said.  Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google have come to dominate digital advertising with self-serve platforms that allow people to buy highly targeted ads based on data Facebook and Google collect about users.  That has come at the expense of traditional players such as newspapers, and it has spooked consumer advocates who are concerned about the rise of a duopoly. "

Chief Executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he should stay, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company. A Facebook representative called Thiel’s sales routine and said there was nothing new to say about the billionaire’ s seat on the company’s board.  Representatives for the venture capitalist could not immediately be reached for comment.  Thiel co-founded payment service PayPal and is known for funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to the shutdown of online news site Gawker. He became a Facebook investor in 2004 with an initial investment of $500,000 at a $5 million valuation. When Zuckerberg took the company public in 2012, Thiel sold 16.8 million shares at the IPO for about $640 million. Later the same year, he sold roughly 20 million of his remaining 26 million shares for $400 million after the expiry of a lockup. He hit the market once again in 2016 to sell a little less than 1 million shares for about $100 million. Facebook shares were down 0.7 percent at $180.59 on Wednesday. "

Americans spend more than 73 minutes a day watching digital video, up more than 7 percent from last year, according to eMarketer data. TV watching has dropped 2 percent from last year to 244 minutes a day, a trend that is expected to continue. Facebook is initially paying some content creators for shows to drive interest. The company is paying $10,000-$35,000 for shorter form shows and up to $250,000 for longer shows, sources told Reuters in May.  The company declined to comment on how much it was spending on shows. Facebook does not intend to make buying content a core piece of its strategy, Dan Rose, vice president of partnerships at Facebook, told Reuters. Facebook plans to eventually open the platform to everyone to submit shows for approval and share 55 percent of ad revenue, Rose said. The company is testing how ads will work within the shows, he added. Watch should help Facebook solidify its position alongside YouTube, the leader in the digital video space, for advertisers, said Paul Verna, a senior analyst with eMarketer. Facebook said Watch is more personal and community-oriented than competitors. For example, it can suggest shows based on a user’s interests and friends can share their thoughts as they watch a video.  For example, fans of the exercise program “CrossFit” can watch and share commentary on live CrossFit events streamed on Facebook while chatting in groups, Rose said. Similarly, fans of Spanish soccer can watch and chat online about “Hala Madrid,” a show about Real Madrid.  “We think our unique opportunity is around community and engaging with people on topics they love to talk about,” said Rose.

2017-07-07,-13,"Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of public policy, met Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan, who offered to approve a Facebook office in Pakistan, which has 33 million users of the network. Khan said Pakistan believes in freedom of expression, but that does not include insulting Islam or stoking religious tensions. “We cannot allow anyone to misuse social media for hurting religious sentiments,” Khan said. Facebook called the meeting “constructive”. “Facebook met with Pakistan officials to express the company’s deep commitment to protecting the rights of the people who use its service, and to enabling people to express themselves freely and safely,” the company said in an email. “It was an important and constructive meeting in which we raised our concerns over the recent court cases and made it clear we apply a strict legal process to any government request for data or content restrictions.” Pakistan’s social media crack-down is officially aimed at weeding out blasphemy and shutting down accounts promoting terrorism, but civil rights activists say it has also swept up writers and bloggers who criticize the government or military.  One of five prominent writers and activists who disappeared for nearly three weeks this year later told a U.N. human rights event in March that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies had kidnapped him and tortured him in custody. Others’ families said right-wing and Islamist parties had filed blasphemy accusations against them to punish them for critical writings. Anything deemed insulting to Islam or the Prophet Muhammad carries a death penalty in Pakistan, and sometimes a mere allegation can lead to mob violence and lynchings. Right groups say the law is frequently abused to settle personal scores. In April, a Pakistani university student, Mashal Khan, was beaten to death by a mob after being accused of blasphemous content on Facebook. Police arrested 57 people accused in the attack and said they had found no evidence Khan committed blasphemy. "
2017-06-27,1,"The user base is bigger than the population of any single country, and of six of the seven continents. It represents more than a quarter of the world’s 7.5 billion people.  Facebook defines a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through its website or a mobile device, or used its Messenger app, in the past 30 days. It does not include people who use the Instagram or WhatsApp networks but not Facebook. The company said in May that duplicate accounts, according to an estimate from last year, may have represented some 6 percent of its worldwide user base. The social network’s user population dwarfs that of similar companies. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) reported in April monthly active users of 328 million, while Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat had 166 million daily users at the end of the first quarter.  Facebook had 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. It reached 1 billion in October 2012.  The company, which Zuckerberg started in 2004 in his college dorm room, uses its huge size advantage to lure advertisers, offering them highly targeted marketing capabilities based on its data about users.  The number of advertisers topped 5 million in April, the company said. Facebook’s growth has increasingly come from outside the United States, Canada and Europe. Three years ago, those regions accounted for some 38 percent of users, compared with about 30 percent in the first quarter of this year.  To increase penetration rates in developing nations, Facebook has rolled out pared-down versions of its apps that use less data, and it has been developing solar-powered drones to extend internet connectivity around the planet.

2017-10-24,-1,"Yves Bot, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said in a non-binding opinion that any national authority could take action against a company for breaching data protection laws in the context of its activities in the country, even if the company is established in another member state. The case stems from a dispute about a German fan page on Facebook which collected data on visitors to that page by storing a cookie on their hard drive. A German court asked the ECJ whether a German data protection authority had jurisdiction over Facebook given its Irish subsidiary Facebook Ireland was responsible for its data processing activities in Europe. Bot said that since the data processing at issue via the installation of cookies “is specifically intended to enable Facebook better to target the advertisements which it publishes,” it could be considered as being part of the activities undertaken by Facebook Germany, which is responsible for the promotion and sale of advertising space in Germany. A spokeswoman for Facebook said: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.” Opinions from Advocate Generals tend to be followed by the Court’s judges in a majority of cases. A final ruling should follow in the coming months. A new EU data protection law will come into force in May next year which seeks to make life easier for multinational businesses like Facebook by introducing a “one stop shop” principle whereby they would only have to deal with the authority in the member state of their main establishment. But Bot pointed out that the new law was not yet in effect and the current framework enables each member state to apply its own national legislation, thereby making the “application of multiple national legislations possible”.

2017-09-11,-6,"The fine stemmed from an investigation into the social network company, which was conducted alongside similar probes in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands, the AEPD authority said. The 1.2 million euro fine is a fraction of Facebook’s quarterly revenue of about $8 billion and stock market capitalisation of around $435 billion.     AEPD said it found three cases in which Facebook had collected details such as the gender, religious beliefs, personal tastes and browsing history of its millions of Spanish users without informing them how such information would be used. Facebook said that it took seriously the privacy of people who use its service, complied with European Union data protection law, and planned to appeal the decision. “As we made clear to (AEPD), users choose which information they want to add to their profile and share with others, such as their religion. However, we do not use this information to target adverts to people,” a company spokeswoman said. AEPD said the U.S. tech giant did not sufficiently inform users about how it would use data collected on third-party websites, and did not obtain consent to use it. “Facebook’s privacy policy contains generic and unclear terms,” the authority said in a statement.  “The social network uses specifically protected data for advertising, among other purposes, without obtaining users’ express consent as data protection law demands, a serious infringement.”   Using cookies, Facebook also collects data from people who do not have an account on the social network but navigate other pages containing a “like” button, AEPD said. Facebook users’ activity can also be tracked on third-party sites, and the information collected added to what is already associated with a Facebook account, AEPD said. According to Facebook, targeting people with content relevant to topics they have indicated an interest in is widely used by the digital advertising industry and is different from showing people content that is based on personal data supplied by users. AEPD said it also found evidence the network kept information for more than 17 months after users closed their accounts. Facebook says it deletes data like photographs and status updates when accounts are closed, in a process which can take up to 90 days but is usually completed sooner.   ($1 = 0.8338 euros) "

2017-05-16,-14,"Last week’s threat prompted a flurry of concern in the Southeast Asian country - one of Asia’s most active on Facebook - that the site would be blocked. However, there would be no immediate measures to block Facebook, Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of Thailand’s telecoms commission, told reporters, adding that bureaucracy had held up the process of removing the 131 impugned content items. “We have the necessary documents from the court to block 34 URLs now,” Takorn said, following a visit to the head office of a grouping of internet providers in Thailand to check if Facebook had complied with the authorities’ removal request.  “Facebook has cooperated well in terms of taking steps to block the URLs that we asked them to in the past,” he added. “If they cooperate, then there will be 97 URLs left which we have asked the court to issue warrants to block.” Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter. The head of the service providers’ association, which groups 19 landline and mobile ISPs and international gateway operators covering 90 per cent of Thailand, also told reporters there was no plan to block access yet. “We haven’t discussed that action to shut down Facebook,”  said Morakot Kulthamyothin, president of the Thai Internet Service Provider Association (TISPA).  All 131 sites were still accessible after the deadline expired on Tuesday, the provider added. Since the military took power in a coup in 2014, Thailand’s government has ramped up online censorship, particularly against material perceived to insult the monarchy. Last month, Thailand also banned citizens from any contact online with three vocal critics of the monarchy. The junta’s latest attempt to block content would not achieve much, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Kyoto University, one of the three critics.   “The government will achieve little from the current ban,” Pavin told Reuters. “If Facebook complies, it will be condemned by the international community. If Facebook ignores the request, then I guess the government will prove to the public that it is serious about this - expect more arrests of those who follow me.” Facebook has said its general guideline on receiving government requests to remove content is to determine whether the material violates local laws before restricting access. In 2016, Facebook blocked 50 pieces of content found to have violated the lese majeste law, following government requests. Since taking power, the military government has made increasing use of the royal insult law, which can carry a penalty of up to 15 years for each offence, against critics. Days after the May 2014 coup, the ministry of information and communications technology blocked access to Facebook temporarily, saying the military had ordered suspension of content critical of its actions.  The junta denied ordering the step.  "
2017-05-24,5,"All of the sources asked to remain anonymous because the deals are confidential. Facebook’s move to acquire and license original content is the latest in its push to attract more advertising dollars, putting the company in head-to-head competition with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube Red, Snapchat’s (SNAP.N) Discover feature, and traditional television networks.  It is an attempt to deliver on Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s remarks to investors earlier this month that the company was looking for so-called “anchor content” that would draw people to the video tab on Facebook’s app.  The world’s biggest social media company is set to pay up to $250,000 for the longer, scripted shows which will be owned by Facebook, taking a page from a strategy employed successfully by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which both now own some of the content they sell to subscribers.  For the second tier of shorter shows, Facebook will pay $10,000 to $35,000 for each show and give creators 55 percent of revenue from ads, the sources said. Ads will run during both the long-form and short-form shows. Facebook currently offers live video from a number of news publishers as well as its own users. It has begun testing the water with live sports video in the last few months. Most recently it signed a deal with Major League Baseball to show 20 games live this season. While Facebook will initially run short-form shows exclusively on its site, the creators of the content will be able to run the shows on their own properties after a negotiated period of time, and will be able to eventually sell them externally, the sources said.   The company is focused on working with news and entertainment makers that are already active on Facebook and have a large millennial following. Vox, BuzzFeed, ATTN and Group Nine Media - the holding company for Thrillist, NowThis and The Dodo - are all working on short-form content for the new Facebook service, the sources said.  Advertisers are interested in learning more about Facebook’s service as they see it as another way to get in front of the growing number of viewers watching their favorite shows on tablets and smartphones, said Monique Lemus O‘Brien, a media buyer at The Media Kitchen. "
2017-09-25,-7,"Speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that Russian operatives bought U.S. political ads on Facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.  “I think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self-regulation. Otherwise, I think regulation will be coming,” Brent McGoldrick, a political ad consultant and a Republican, said at Advertising Week New York.  Last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed $100,000 in Russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of U.S. social divides, the Washington Post reported on Monday.  Facebook shares ended down 4.5 percent on Monday, closing at $162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive. Zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.  Andrew Capone, senior vice president of NCC Media, a cable trade group, joked on Monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “Facebook took in over 300 million rubles - I‘m sorry, dollars.”  McGoldrick said on the panel: “If I were Facebook and Google and everyone else, I would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria. They may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.” Google has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a Russian propaganda campaign like the one Facebook found. The two Silicon Valley firms are set to take a combined 63 percent of the U.S. market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.  Though Facebook and Google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller have helped to change the situation, said Jefrey Pollock, president of public relations firm Global Strategy Group.  “Things change with a subpoena,” Pollock, a Democrat, said as part of the panel. "
2017-06-23,-8,"Douez said her privacy rights under provincial law were violated, a growing concern among social media users in recent years who fear their personal information or photos will be used without their knowledge. The ads, which the company has since dropped, used Facebook members’ names and pictures to advertise companies and products to other members. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook had sought to suspend Douez’s lawsuit, saying that its terms of use require disputes to be resolved in the U.S. state. In a 4-3 decision, Canada’s Supreme Court ruled that the clause is unenforceable. The justices wrote that there was evidence of “gross inequality of bargaining power” between individual consumers and the company, given users have little choice but to accept Facebook’s terms of use. Canadian courts also have a greater interest in deciding cases that impinge on citizens’ rights “because these rights play an essential role in a free and democratic society and embody key Canadian values,” the court said. A spokesman for Facebook said the company continues to believe the underlying claims are without merit, and it will defend itself “vigorously”. British Columbia’s top court is better placed to rule on the province’s laws than a California court would be, the court said. Justices said their decision was also supported by the expense and inconvenience of having Canadians travel to California to sue Facebook being greater than any inconvenience the company would face in making its records available in British Columbia. A lower court had allowed Douez’s case to be considered as a group lawsuit, but the high court did not address the issue of class action status. Facebook reached a $20 million settlement in the United States in a class action lawsuit over the use of Sponsored Stories. The settlement was given court approval in 2013.  Facebook’s shares were up 0.4 percent at $154.09 in mid-day trade. "

2017-10-27,-8,"Details will include the size of spending and the demographics of the audience the ads reached, Goldman said. The archive, beginning with ads carried in 2018, will cover a rolling four-year period, he said.  Internet political ads have boomed in recent years as U.S. politicians looked for different ways to reach potential supporters, and as companies including Facebook have created tools to allow targeted marketing.  Online ads, though, are generally viewable only to the intended audience, raising concerns among transparency advocates, researchers and lawmakers about how to hold politicians accountable for what they say.  The planned archive reflects a change in corporate policy for the world’s largest social network, which had previously resisted the idea.  In June, Facebook told Reuters that it would go on treating political ads like all others and that creating an online repository would violate the confidentiality of those advertisers. Since then, Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have all said that Russia-based operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread politically divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow has denied interfering in the election.  Next week, general counsels for Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before public hearings of three U.S. congressional committees about the alleged interference and proposed legislation to require them to disclose election-related ads.  Goldman wrote in his post: “Transparency helps everyone, especially political watchdog groups and reporters, keep advertisers accountable for who they say they are and what they say to different groups.”  Facebook said its archive will eventually expand beyond the United States and show ads from elections in other countries and jurisdictions.  In the future, advertisers on Facebook will also be required to include a disclosure in election-related ads, to read: “Paid for by,” the company said. The announcement fleshes out ideas that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg outlined in September, as criticism of California-based Facebook built inside the United States over the Russian ads. The changes will test in Canada before being brought to the United States ahead of November 2018 elections, Facebook said.   Twitter took similar steps this week, saying it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind them, and it barred two Russian media outlets from running ads. "
2017-09-07,-3,"Some factors might partly explain the yawning gap. Age is self-reported, so groups may not perfectly align with the official national tally from seven years ago. Facebook also might be capturing non-residents, visitors or users holding multiple accounts. What’s more, advertisers aren’t billed according to the estimated figures anyway.  Even so, the bloated numbers fit a troubling pattern. Last September, for example, the company found it had been flubbing calculations on how much time users spent watching videos. It was one of several such mistakes discovered over the past year. Madison Avenue finds itself in a difficult spot. Media planners and big spenders like Procter & Gamble should have more negotiating power with Facebook. They also could shift some digital dollars to Google. But the company led by Mark Zuckerberg is dominant online and the internet search giant has had its own problems, including putting ads aside questionable material.   The bigger issue for Facebook is that it wants to compete in television. Most recently, it was willing to splash out $600 million for rights to Indian cricket matches, according to press reports. That sum represents nearly 14 percent of its entire ad-revenue haul for the Asia-Pacific region last year.   Facebook lost the auction to Rupert Murdoch, but it is illustrative of the company’s ambition. If it’s serious about successfully winning some significant portion of the $75 billion spent on U.S. broadcast advertising, it can’t merely self-police its audience. Allowing outsiders such as Nielsen to measure its data marks a step in the right direction. For now, though, Facebook’s own fuzzy math blurs its TV picture. "
2017-05-08,-5,"* Court says hate posts must be deleted across the platform * Says Facebook should be able to automate process By Shadia Nasralla VIENNA, May 8 (Reuters) - Facebook must remove postings deemed as hate speech, an Austrian court has ruled, in a legal victory for campaigners who want to force social media companies to combat online “trolling”. The case - brought by Austria’s Green party over insults to its leader - has international ramifications as the court ruled the postings must be deleted across the platform and not just in Austria, a point that had been left open in an initial ruling. The case comes as legislators around Europe are considering ways of forcing Facebook, Google, Twitter and others to rapidly remove hate speech or incitement to violence. Germany’s cabinet approved a plan last month to fine social networks up to 50 million euros ($55 million) if they fail to remove such postings quickly and the European Union is considering new EU-wide rules. Facebook’s lawyers in Vienna declined to comment on the ruling, which was distributed by the Greens and confirmed by a court spokesman, and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Strengthening the earlier ruling, the Viennese appeals court ruled on Friday that Facebook must remove the postings against Greens leader Eva Glawischnig as well as any verbatim repostings, and said merely blocking them in Austria without deleting them for users abroad was not sufficient. The court added it was easy for Facebook to automate this process. It said, however, that Facebook could not be expected to trawl through content to find posts that are similar, rather than identical, to ones already identified as hate speech. The Greens hope to get the ruling strengthened further at Austria’s highest court. They want the court to demand Facebook remove similar - not only identical - postings, and to make it identify holders of fake accounts. The Greens also want Facebook to pay damages, which would make it easier for individuals in similar cases to take the financial risk of taking legal action. “Facebook must put up with the accusation that it is the world’s biggest platform for hate and that it is doing nothing against this,” said Green parliamentarian Dieter Brosz. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said hate speech has no place on the platform and the company has published a policy paper on how it wants to work against false news. (Editing by Robin Pomeroy)"

The opt-in badge will be visible when a user comments on content shared by their federal, state and local representatives. Facebook also announced “Constituent Insights,” which allows elected officials and other users to find local news stories that are popular in their district. “District Targeting” creates a new preset audience selection that lets politicians’ pages target posts to people likely to be their constituents. Facebook has continued to come under attack from prominent Democrats and some technology experts despite a raft of changes it has made in recent months that seek to help users consume more legitimate political news. Hillary Clinton, who ran for president as a Democrat last year but lost to President Donald Trump, a Republican, said last week that Facebook was flooded with false information about her during the campaign and that people were understandably misled. She said she wanted Facebook to curate its network more aggressively. "
2017-11-02,-13,"The posts from Russia were designed to divide Americans, particularly around the 2016 U.S. elections, according to Facebook, U.S. intelligence agencies and lawmakers. The Russian government has denied it tried to meddle in the elections. “When you discover a deceptive foreign government presentation on your platform, my presumption, from what you’ve said today - you’ll stop it and take it down,” Democratic Senator Jack Reed told Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch in the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday. “Do you feel an obligation, in turn, to notify those people who have accessed that? And can you do that? And shouldn’t you do that?” Reed asked. Stretch responded that he was not sure Facebook could identify the people because its estimates have relied on modeling, rather than actual counts, but he did not rule it out.  “The technical challenges associated with that undertaking are substantial,” Stretch said. Critics of Facebook on social media and in media interviews have expressed skepticism, noting that the company closely tracks user activity such as likes and clicks for advertising purposes. Facebook declined to comment on Thursday. As many as 126 million people could have been served the posts on Facebook and 20 million on Instagram, according to company estimates. Many of them will not believe they were manipulated unless Facebook tells them, said Tristan Harris of Time Well Spent, an organization critical of advertising-based social media.  “Facebook is a living, breathing crime scene, and they’re the only ones with access to what happened,” Harris, an ex-Google employee, said in an interview on Thursday. The 2.1 billion people with active Facebook accounts often get notifications from the service, on everything from birthdays and upcoming events to friend requests and natural disasters.  Shortly before 6 p.m. EDT on Thursday, more than 83,000 people had signed a Change.org online petition asking Facebook to tell users about the Russian posts.  Lawyers for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google also said their companies would consider notifying customers. The intelligence committee’s vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner, drew an analogy to another industry.  “If you were in a medical facility, and you got exposed to a disease, the medical facility would have to tell the folks who were exposed,” Warner said. U.S. law includes a concept known as “post-sale duty to warn,” which may require notifying previous buyers if a manufacturer discovers a problem with a product. That legal duty likely does not apply to Facebook, said Christopher Robinette, a law professor at Widener University in Pennsylvania. He said courts would likely rule that social media posts are not a product but a service, which is exempt from the duty. Courts also do not want to interfere in free speech, he said. Robinette added, though, that he thought notifications to users would be a good idea. “This strikes me as a fairly significant problem,” he said. "

2017-05-04,-5,"Facebook has warned for some time about declining non-ad revenue. That part of its business consists almost entirely of video game players on desktop computers buying virtual currency, and it has fallen as gaming has moved to smartphones. Facebook takes 30 percent of purchases, with the balance going to companies such as Zynga Inc, maker of the game Farmville.  The company’s dependence on advertising is a long-term concern but it has time to find other revenue while building its core ad business, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. “We have to remember it’s still a fairly young business. It’s not like they’re an old-fashioned business that needs to move soon,” he said.  Facebook’s share price hit an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday before dipping to close at $150.85 on Thursday.  The lack of diversification stands in contrast to Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. Its non-advertising revenue, from sources such as cloud services and Pixel smartphones, posted a 49.4 percent jump to $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter and now represents 13 percent of Google’s total revenue, up from 10 percent a year earlier.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during a conference call in February that the company was diversifying  revenue by expanding its base of advertisers across geographic regions and industries. Facebook’s non-advertising products, such as its Oculus virtual reality headset and the Workplace office software, currently generate little revenue.  Some companies diversify through acquisitions, but most of Facebook’s purchases such as Instagram and WhatsApp have been in adjacent markets.  Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a conference call for investors on Wednesday that Facebook was not breaking out Instagram revenue as a separate line in financial reports because Instagram ads are sold through the same interface as Facebook ads. "
2017-09-28,-9,"Trump appeared to embrace the focus on the social media network in his comments on Wednesday, which also took aim at more traditional medial outlets, long targeted by the president as “fake news.” “Facebook was always anti-Trump. The networks were always anti-Trump,” Trump said on Twitter, levelling the same charge against the New York Times and the Washington Post. “Collusion?” Representatives for Facebook and the newspapers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those investigating Russia’s role, said he expected to have the ads by next week and that they should be made public. “I have concerns about how long it took Facebook to realise the Russians were advertising on their network,” Schiff told MSNBC, adding that he has spoken several times with the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.  Facebook and other technology companies are coming under increased scrutiny amid the Russia investigations. The probes, being conducted by several congressional committees along with the Department of Justice, have clouded Trump’s tenure since taking office in January and threatened his agenda, which has yet to secure a major legislative victory.  Moscow has denied any collusion. Trump himself has previously praised Facebook and credited it with helping him win the November election. His campaign has said it spent some $70 million on Facebook ads, and it also ran  a live Facebook show.  His latest comments did not appear to affect shares of the company, which were up 1.4 percent at $166.50 a share in late morning trading after analysts raised their price target for the stock. "
2017-07-03,-18,"“We believe there are important First Amendment concerns with this case, including the government’s refusal to let us notify three people of broad requests for their account information in connection with public events,” Facebook said in a statement on Monday.  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights including freedom of speech.  William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors, declined to comment.  Facebook decided to challenge the gag order around the three warrants because free speech was at stake and because the events underlying the government’s investigation were generally known to the public already, Facebook said in the undated court document.  The precise nature of the government’s investigation is not known. One document in the case said the timing of proceedings coincides with charges against people who protested President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.  More than 200 people were arrested in Washington the day Trump was sworn in. Masked activists threw rocks at police, and multiple vehicles were set on fire.  Tech firms comply with thousands of requests for user data annually made by governments around the world, but in extraordinary circumstances, companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have challenged government secrecy orders.  Facebook recently fought a secrecy order related to a disability fraud investigation, losing in April in New York state’s highest court. Companies and privacy advocates argue that gag orders rely on outdated laws and are applied too often, sometimes indefinitely, to bar them from notifying customers about government requests for their private online data. Facebook says about half of U.S. requests are accompanied by a non-disclosure order prohibiting it from notifying affected users.  In April, a local judge in Washington denied Facebook’s request to remove the gag order there, according to the document. Facebook is appealing and has preserved the relevant records pending the outcome, the document said.  “The government can only insulate its actions from public scrutiny in this way in the rarest circumstances, which likely do not apply here,” said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for digital rights.  Facebook is getting support in court papers from several organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as eight tech companies such as Microsoft and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in Washington for local matters, is scheduled to hear the case in September, according to an order obtained by BuzzFeed News, which first reported Facebook’s challenge to the gag order on Monday.

Rival U.S. internet firms are racing for similar programming. Twitter Inc announced an agreement this month with the WNBA to show professional women’s basketball, and last month Amazon.com Inc said it would stream men’s professional football in a deal with the NFL.  For the baseball broadcast, Facebook said it will use a feed from a participating team’s local broadcast rightsholder.  “Baseball games are uniquely engaging community experiences, as the chatter and rituals in the stands are often as meaningful to fans as the action on the diamond,” Dan Reed, Facebook’s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. “By distributing a live game per week on Facebook, Major League Baseball can re-imagine this social experience on a national scale,” he said. Facebook says it has some 182 million daily active users in the United States and Canada.  "

The aircraft flew for an hour and 46 minutes before landing near Yuma, Arizona, with only “a few minor, easily-repairable dings,” he said. Facebook engineers had added “spoilers” to the aircraft’s wings to increase drag and reduce lift during the landing approach, Gomez said.  "

Trump carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and Michigan by 10,700 votes. About 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on Facebook which were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the U.S. election, Facebook said on Monday as social media companies face calls for increased regulation and more transparency to open up the opaque world of online political ads. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees are investigating possible links between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Russia denies meddling in the election. A representative from Facebook could not be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  "
2017-09-22,-11,"Earlier this month, Facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 Facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to Congress but said on Thursday it would do so, making a concession to U.S. lawmakers who have threatened to regulate the world’s largest social network over ads that run during election campaigns. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on Facebook, no matter whom they target. Facebook also will demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under U.S. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia engaged in cyber attacks to sway the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton in favor of Trump. U.S. congressional investigators and a special counsel are investigating the matter. Moscow has denied any interference. While Trump dismissed the advertisement controversy, his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, expressed concern. “Well, I think all of these social media providers are faced with many challenges,” Tillerson said on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” pointing to their use by militant groups around the world as well as in election campaigns.  “But they also have responsibilities,” he said. “And I think they’re going to have to think carefully about their responsibilities in this regard.” U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.

2017-10-04,0,"Facebook UK Ltd. had revenues in Britain of 842 million pounds in 2016, up from 202 million pounds in 2015, after it switched to booking sales to larger UK clients in Britain. In 2015, turnover was booked through Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin and the British subsidiary’s revenue represented payments from the Dublin unit. Facebook UK Ltd. reported a current tax charge for 2016 of 5.1 million pounds, compared to 4.2 million pounds for 2015. The modest change in Facebook’s tax bill reflects the fact that the tax authority had already calculated Facebook had taxable profits, although these never generated actual cash tax obligations because of generous offsets related to share awards. The 2016 tax charge was also reduced by “additional expenses deductible for tax purposes” which the firm declined to outline. Facebook still books some sales to smaller clients via Dublin. European Union members are keen to stop technology giants like Google and Apple from operating almost tax free in the bloc.  The companies, which all say they follow tax rules, typically channel sales via countries like Ireland and Luxembourg whose light touch approach to taxation allows the companies to shift profits on to zero tax jurisdictions. This means they usually do not report profits in the countries where their salespeople and customers are based, making it impossible for hosts to tax them. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, has outlined options to tackle this including a tax on the companies’ turnover, a levy on online ads and withholding taxes. If other EU countries could prompt tech companies to report more profit in their jurisdictions, they could reap greater tax revenues than Britain has achieved because they have a less generous approach to deductions than Britain.

2017-06-15,-10,"The world’s largest social media network, with 1.9 billion users, Facebook has not always been so open about its operations, and its statement was met with skepticism by some who have criticized U.S. technology companies for moving slowly.  “We’ve known that extremist groups have been weaponizing the internet for years,” said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth College computer scientist who studies ways to stem extremist material online. “So why, for years, have they been understaffing their moderation? Why, for years, have they been behind on innovation?” Farid asked. He called Facebook’s statement a public relations move in response to European governments.  Britain’s interior ministry welcomed Facebook’s efforts but said technology companies needed to go further. “This includes the use of technical solutions so that terrorist content can be identified and removed before it is widely disseminated, and ultimately prevented from being uploaded in the first place,” a ministry spokesman said on Thursday.  Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech.  Government officials have threatened to fine Facebook and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users.  Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda.  “More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves; that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,” Bickert said in a telephone interview.  Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said, “We’re talking about this because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.” Facebook’s blog post on Thursday was the first in a planned series of announcements to address “hard questions” facing the company, Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy and communications, said in a statement. Other questions, he said, include: “Is social media good for democracy?”  On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron launched a joint campaign to go after “terrorists and criminals” on the internet and to root out radicalizing material.  “Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content,” May said at a joint news conference.  Macron’s office declined to comment on Facebook’s statement on Thursday.  "
2017-09-13,-19,"The new standards coincided with an appearance by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in Germany, one of Facebook’s toughest critics on hate speech and safeguarding privacy.  Facebook, together with Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, accounts for around two fifths of internet advertising, which is forecast by consultancy Zenith to grow by 13 percent to $205 billion this year – overtaking television as the biggest channel for companies to pitch their wares to consumers. Marketing executives have criticized Facebook for failing to ensure that the digital ads distributed to its more than 2 billion active users reach their intended audience.  It has also drawn criticism from major advertisers for inflating its audience figures and not adequately tracking ads, which were sometimes placed alongside content detrimental to the brands being promoted.  On Wednesday, Facebook said it would seek accreditation from the Media Ratings Council, a U.S. non-profit organization, for audience measurement services. “We take very seriously our responsibility to earn and maintain the trust of people in businesses,” Sandberg told dmexco, a major digital marketing gathering in Cologne. “We hear their concerns about safe environments, about standards, about measurement, and this is critical to us,” she said. “We’re working hard to roll things out that give you more control over where your ads run, and more knowledge about where your ads run, before, during and after campaign.” Those publishing content flagged as misinformation or false news may be ruled ineligible to profit from Facebook, as would creators of clickbait and sensationalism, according to the rules seen by Reuters. Facebook’s guidelines for monetization give broad definitions of content that would be disallowed – including “family entertainment characters engaged in violent, sexualized, or otherwise inappropriate behavior”. Also covered are depictions of death, casualties and physical injuries in tragedies such as natural disasters; and content that is incendiary, inflammatory, demeaning or disparaging toward people or groups. Facebook said it will provide post-campaign feedback to advertisers that clearly identifies the publishers that ran their ads.  Facebook will also step up its monitoring of hate speech, adding 3,000 content reviewers to nearly double the size of its existing team, Senior Vice President for Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson said in a blog post. “As soon as we determine that content has breached our community standards, we remove it. With a community as large as Facebook, however, zero tolerance cannot mean zero occurrence,” she said. Germany has led the way in demanding action on hate speech. Its parliament passed a law in June to introduce fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) for social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly. "
2017-05-08,-6,"* Court says hate posts must be deleted across the platform * Says Facebook should be able to automate process (Updates to say Facebook declined to comment) By Shadia Nasralla VIENNA, May 8 (Reuters) - Facebook must remove postings deemed as hate speech, an Austrian court has ruled, in a legal victory for campaigners who want to force social media companies to combat online “trolling”. The case - brought by Austria’s Green party over insults to its leader - has international ramifications as the court ruled the postings must be deleted across the platform and not just in Austria, a point that had been left open in an initial ruling. The case comes as legislators around Europe are considering ways of forcing Facebook, Google, Twitter and others to rapidly remove hate speech or incitement to violence. Germany’s cabinet approved a plan last month to fine social networks up to 50 million euros ($55 million) if they fail to remove such postings quickly and the European Union is considering new EU-wide rules. Facebook and its lawyers in Vienna declined to comment on the ruling, which was distributed by the Greens and confirmed by a court spokesman. Strengthening the earlier ruling, the Viennese appeals court ruled on Friday that Facebook must remove the postings against Greens leader Eva Glawischnig as well as any verbatim repostings, and said merely blocking them in Austria without deleting them for users abroad was not sufficient. The court added it was easy for Facebook to automate this process. It said, however, that Facebook could not be expected to trawl through content to find posts that are similar, rather than identical, to ones already identified as hate speech. The Greens hope to get the ruling strengthened further at Austria’s highest court. They want the court to demand Facebook remove similar - not only identical - postings, and to make it identify holders of fake accounts. The Greens also want Facebook to pay damages, which would make it easier for individuals in similar cases to take the financial risk of taking legal action. “Facebook must put up with the accusation that it is the world’s biggest platform for hate and that it is doing nothing against this,” said Green parliamentarian Dieter Brosz. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said hate speech has no place on the platform and the company has published a policy paper on how it wants to work against false news.

2017-07-27,2,"Shares rose 6 percent to $175 in early trading, adding gains worth twice the market capitalization of rival Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).   Facebook’s stock slipped as much as 2 percent on May 4, a day after the company posted first-quarter results and said ad revenue growth was expected to come down significantly over the rest of 2017. Ad sales growth did slow to 47 percent in the June quarter, after a 51 percent increase in the March quarter, but investors brushed it aside, looking ahead to new growth drivers - WhatsApp, Messenger and video. At least eleven brokerages raised their price targets. Wedbush was the most bullish, lifting its target by $40 to $225. The median price target is $190. “The strength of Facebook’s mind-boggling results continued to be a testament to the platform’s massive user base and unparalleled targeting abilities,” MoffettNathanson Research analyst Michael Nathanson said. Facebook has more than 2 billion regular users. Its two messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp, have more than 1 billion users each.    Mobile advertising accounted for 87 percent of the $9.16 billion in total ad revenue even as the average growth in ad price jumped 24 percent to a record high. Advertisers will continue to buy ads despite an increase in prices given Facebook’s superior return on investment compared with other digital platforms, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju said. Facebook also cut its forecast for expense growth even as it said it was moving to diversify its revenue stream by investing in initiatives such as video and TV-style programming. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected video to become the “primary driver” of revenue over the next few years. Lack of details, however, left analysts cautious about the company’s video efforts, which would have to compete with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). “The biggest open-ended questions will be how successfully Facebook can monetize its video-only tab and TV extension product,” MoffettNathanson’s Nathanson said. "
2017-09-22,-10,"Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on Facebook, no matter whom they target.  Facebook will also demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under U.S. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media.  “We will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads,” Zuckerberg said.  Zuckerberg, broadcasting live on Facebook from company headquarters in Menlo Park, California, said the changes would help address concerns that governments including Russia are using Facebook ads to meddle in other countries’ elections. Earlier this month, Facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 Facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after last year’s U.S. presidential election. The company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to Congress. U.S. congressional investigators and special counsel Robert Mueller are examining alleged Russian election interference, which Moscow has denied. Investigators are interested in other companies as well. Representatives for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are set to meet next week with staff from the Senate Intelligence Committee in relation to inquiries into the 2016 election.  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that he wants to hear from Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Twitter and others in public hearings.  “It will be important for the committee to scrutinize how rigorous Facebook’s internal investigation has been, to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did,” Schiff said in a statement. ‘WILD, WILD WEST’ The political advertising changes represent a retreat for Facebook, which for years has resisted calls from transparency advocates and academics for the regulation of political ads. The company has instead treated them like all commercial ads. In the days after the November 2016 U.S. election, Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that misinformation on Facebook swayed the vote toward President Donald Trump.  Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild West” and said legislation might be needed to address them.  Facebook has grown to be the leading online platform for political ads because of its low costs and tools for targeting messages to narrow audiences.  U.S. political campaigns likely spent $300 million on Facebook ads during the 2016 election cycle, according to Nomura analysts, though the exact amount is unknown.  It remained unclear whether Facebook’s voluntary changes would satisfy demands for government action.  Warner and another senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, on Thursday sent a letter to colleagues inviting them to be co-sponsors of legislation they are writing that would formalize and expand the commitments Zuckerberg made.  The legislation, they wrote, would require digital platforms with 1 million or more users to maintain a publicly available file of all election-related ads bought by people who spend more than $10,000, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.  Trevor Potter, president of the pro-transparency Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement that his group would “carefully monitor Facebook’s implementation of this new policy.” He said Facebook “helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the 2016 elections.” In the past, Facebook has argued that ad details had to remain confidential unless released by the advertisers. He said Facebook would hire 250 additional people; expand partnerships with election commissions around the world; and adapt systems to help deter political bullying.  Facebook has not found an attempt at election-meddling in Germany, Zuckerberg said, but he added that the company would continue to examine fake accounts that it has removed in advance of Sunday’s German national election.  “I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That’s not what we stand for,” Zuckerberg said.  Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said in a blog post on Thursday that it was unusual for Facebook to voluntarily turn over information to government authorities, as it was doing by giving U.S. lawmakers copies of ads. The company has long had a rigid policy of refusing to turn over any user information without a court order or other legal process.   But ultimately, Stretch wrote, “We believe the public deserves a full accounting of what happened in the 2016 election.” "
2017-08-25,-15,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM) lambasted the tech giant for failing to police the platform and help crack down on traffickers. One video hosted on the site since June shows Libyan gangmasters threatening emaciated and abused migrants - mostly Somalis and Ethiopians - huddled in a concrete room. IOM said the traffickers had sent clips to the captives’ families via the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp - a Facebook channel - along with threats that their loved ones would be killed unless ransoms of up to $10,000 were paid. One young Somali man is seen lying face down with a concrete block on his back. “I was asked for $8,000,” he says, according to the IOM. “They broke my teeth. They broke my hand. I have been here 11 months. They put this stone on me for the last three days. It’s really painful.” British newspaper The Times, which ran the story on its front page on Friday, also quoted a young Ethiopian who had been held for 15 months. “They beat me with iron bars,” he said.  “They ordered me to pay $8,300 and my family cannot afford to pay that amount.” Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe since 2014, and thousands have died trying. Facebook, which has also been criticized for failing to stop traffickers using the platform to advertise their services, said posts by smuggling groups would be removed if reported. “We encourage people to keep using our reporting tools to flag this kind of behavior so it can be reviewed and swiftly removed by our global team of experts, who work with law enforcement agencies around the world,” a spokesperson said. But Facebook said it had not removed the June video as it had been posted by a Somali journalist and was important for raising awareness of the problem. However, IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle accused Facebook of “arrant nonsense”, adding that the smugglers had used the journalist to publicize their demands. He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it was totally inappropriate for Facebook to host a video showing the faces of vulnerable people being abused. ”Don’t let Facebook off the hook here,“ he said. ”It’s an absolutely nonsensical argument that it’s up to the public to notify Facebook of stuff that’s happening on Facebook. “They should invest heavily in policing their platforms to stop vulnerable migrants being exploited, extorted and murdered.” Doyle said the IOM had tried without success to talk to Facebook about targeting smugglers. “They should stop smugglers telling people there’s an El Dorado waiting for them in Europe when it’s a lie,” he added.  “It’s not good enough to say, ‘we are a technology platform, it’s got nothing to do with us’.”      Doyle said the IOM had tried to find the people in the video, but they had disappeared. "
2017-06-30,-6,"Facebook said the change would reduce the influence of a “tiny group” of people it has identified who share vast amounts of low-quality public posts daily. Only about 0.1 percent of people who share more than 50 posts a day fall into that category, the company said. The change would affect only links shared by those people, not their photos or other posts, the company said. “Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people’s feeds,” said Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s vice president for the News Feed, in a blog post.  Ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Facebook users saw false news reports saying Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook, which has 2 billion monthly active users, frequently tweaks the computer code behind the News Feed. The latest tweak will have a negligible effect, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who monitors social media, in a telephone interview, adding that Facebook needs to hire more content moderators. “Communications platforms used to employ a whole lot more humans, but what we’ve been led to believe now is that technology will solve everything,” Grygiel said.  In May, Facebook announced a change that would give lower prominence to links that lead to pages full of deceptive or annoying ads. A change in August was designed to deemphasize stories with clickbait-style headlines.  Friday’s change will de-prioritize links from specific spammers, Mosseri said. "
2017-09-25,-7,"Speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that Russian operatives bought U.S. political ads on Facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.  “I think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self-regulation. Otherwise, I think regulation will be coming,” Brent McGoldrick, a political ad consultant and a Republican, said at Advertising Week New York.  Last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed $100,000 in Russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of U.S. social divides, the Washington Post reported on Monday.  Facebook shares ended down 4.5 percent on Monday, closing at $162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive. Zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.  Andrew Capone, senior vice president of NCC Media, a cable trade group, joked on Monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “Facebook took in over 300 million rubles - I‘m sorry, dollars.”  McGoldrick said on the panel: “If I were Facebook and Google and everyone else, I would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria. They may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.” Google has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a Russian propaganda campaign like the one Facebook found. The two Silicon Valley firms are set to take a combined 63 percent of the U.S. market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.  Though Facebook and Google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller have helped to change the situation, said Jefrey Pollock, president of public relations firm Global Strategy Group.  “Things change with a subpoena,” Pollock, a Democrat, said as part of the panel. "
2017-08-09,0,"The world’s largest social network added a video tab last year, and it has been dropping hints for months that it wanted to become a source of original and well-produced videos, rather than just shows made by users.  Reuters reported in May that Facebook had signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators Vox Media, BuzzFeed, ATTN, Group Nine Media and others to produce shows, both scripted and unscripted.  “We’ve learned that people like the serendipity of discovering videos in News Feed, but they also want a dedicated place they can go to watch videos,” Daniel Danker, Facebook’s product director, said in a statement on Wednesday. Facebook said the shows would include videos of the Women’s National Basketball Association, a parenting show from Time Inc and a safari show from National Geographic. Facebook is already broadcasting some Major League Baseball games and that would continue, the company said.  ATTN said on Wednesday it had two original series coming to Facebook Watch: a health program with actress Jessica Alba and a relationship advice show.  Eventually, the platform would be open to any show creator as a place to distribute video, Facebook said.  The company, based in Menlo Park, California, faces a crowded market with not only traditional television networks but newer producers such as Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube as well as Twitter Inc and Snap Inc.  "
2017-09-12,-1,"Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on its spending. Facebook’s Watch was rolled out to U.S. users last month. The company has initially been paying for a handful of shows to attract viewers to the platform. It has paid $10,000 to $35,000 for shorter-form shows and up to $250,000 for some longer-scripted shows, sources told Reuters in May. “We think we have a big hit on our hands,” said Rory Brown, president of Bleacher Report, declining to comment on how many millions Facebook is paying Bleacher Report for the show. “People are going to spend more time on Facebook because of it.”  “No Script” will start streaming this month and consists of eight 10- to 15-minute episodes featuring various antics by Lynch, who is returning to football as a running back for the Raiders. The first episode features Lynch taking racecar driving lessons until he ruins the tires of the car. In a deal similar to others, Facebook retains exclusive rights to the show for a period of time, Brown said, declining to elaborate on the exclusivity window. After that period Bleacher Report owns the content and can use it.  It was a big priority for Bleacher Report to keep the show authentic, given Lynch’s raw style, Brown said. For the most part Facebook gave Bleacher Report full creative control, however the social media network does have concerns about offensive language, Brown said. “I wouldn’t be shocked if that ends up being censored,” he said.

"
2017-05-17,-7,"The EU executive and Facebook declined to comment.  During regulatory scrutiny of the WhatsApp deal in 2014, Facebook told the EU competition enforcer it was unable reliably to match the two companies’ user accounts.  The Commission subsequently found that this was technically  possible at the time.  Regulators met this week on the case and a decision could come either this week or next, the person said. The Commission can fine a company as much as 1 percent of its global turnover, which in Facebook’s case could reach $276 million based on its 2016 revenue.  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in March told a news conference that a small handful of companies may have provided misleading information when they sought approval for their mergers. The EU sanction will come on the heels of a 150,000-euro fine handed down by a French data watchdog to Facebook on Tuesday for failing to prevent its users’ data being accessed by advertisers. Italian antitrust authorities levied a 3-million-euro fine on WhatsApp last week for allegedly obliging users to agree to share their personal data with Facebook. "
2017-07-07,-13,"Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of public policy, met Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan, who offered to approve a Facebook office in Pakistan, which has 33 million users of the network. Khan said Pakistan believes in freedom of expression, but that does not include insulting Islam or stoking religious tensions. “We cannot allow anyone to misuse social media for hurting religious sentiments,” Khan said. Facebook called the meeting “constructive”. “Facebook met with Pakistan officials to express the company’s deep commitment to protecting the rights of the people who use its service, and to enabling people to express themselves freely and safely,” the company said in an email. “It was an important and constructive meeting in which we raised our concerns over the recent court cases and made it clear we apply a strict legal process to any government request for data or content restrictions.” Pakistan’s social media crack-down is officially aimed at weeding out blasphemy and shutting down accounts promoting terrorism, but civil rights activists say it has also swept up writers and bloggers who criticize the government or military.  One of five prominent writers and activists who disappeared for nearly three weeks this year later told a U.N. human rights event in March that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies had kidnapped him and tortured him in custody. Others’ families said right-wing and Islamist parties had filed blasphemy accusations against them to punish them for critical writings. Anything deemed insulting to Islam or the Prophet Muhammad carries a death penalty in Pakistan, and sometimes a mere allegation can lead to mob violence and lynchings. Right groups say the law is frequently abused to settle personal scores. In April, a Pakistani university student, Mashal Khan, was beaten to death by a mob after being accused of blasphemous content on Facebook. Police arrested 57 people accused in the attack and said they had found no evidence Khan committed blasphemy. "
2017-08-31,-1," On Watch, which Facebook began testing earlier this month, users can see hundreds of shows from the likes of Vox, Buzzfeed, Discovery Communications Inc, A&E Networks, Walt Disney Co’s ABC, as well as live sports like Major League Baseball. Americans spend more than 73 minutes a day watching digital video, up more than 7 percent from last year, according to eMarketer data. TV watching has dropped 2 percent from last year to 244 minutes a day, a trend that is expected to continue. Facebook is initially paying some content creators for shows to drive interest. The company is paying $10,000-$35,000 for shorter form shows and up to $250,000 for longer shows, sources told Reuters in May.  The company declined to comment on how much it was spending on shows. Facebook does not intend to make buying content a core piece of its strategy, Dan Rose, vice president of partnerships at Facebook, told Reuters. Facebook plans to eventually open the platform to everyone to submit shows for approval and share 55 percent of ad revenue, Rose said. The company is testing how ads will work within the shows, he added. Watch should help Facebook solidify its position alongside YouTube, the leader in the digital video space, for advertisers, said Paul Verna, a senior analyst with eMarketer. Facebook said Watch is more personal and community-oriented than competitors. For example, it can suggest shows based on a user’s interests and friends can share their thoughts as they watch a video.  For example, fans of the exercise program “CrossFit” can watch and share commentary on live CrossFit events streamed on Facebook while chatting in groups, Rose said. Similarly, fans of Spanish soccer can watch and chat online about “Hala Madrid,” a show about Real Madrid.  “We think our unique opportunity is around community and engaging with people on topics they love to talk about,” said Rose. "
2017-05-16,-14,"Last week’s threat prompted a flurry of concern in the Southeast Asian country - one of Asia’s most active on Facebook - that the site would be blocked. However, there would be no immediate measures to block Facebook, Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of Thailand’s telecoms commission, told reporters, adding that bureaucracy had held up the process of removing the 131 impugned content items. “We have the necessary documents from the court to block 34 URLs now,” Takorn said, following a visit to the head office of a grouping of internet providers in Thailand to check if Facebook had complied with the authorities’ removal request.  “Facebook has cooperated well in terms of taking steps to block the URLs that we asked them to in the past,” he added. “If they cooperate, then there will be 97 URLs left which we have asked the court to issue warrants to block.” Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter. The head of the service providers’ association, which groups 19 landline and mobile ISPs and international gateway operators covering 90 per cent of Thailand, also told reporters there was no plan to block access yet. “We haven’t discussed that action to shut down Facebook,”  said Morakot Kulthamyothin, president of the Thai Internet Service Provider Association (TISPA).  All 131 sites were still accessible after the deadline expired on Tuesday, the provider added. Since the military took power in a coup in 2014, Thailand’s government has ramped up online censorship, particularly against material perceived to insult the monarchy. Last month, Thailand also banned citizens from any contact online with three vocal critics of the monarchy. The junta’s latest attempt to block content would not achieve much, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Kyoto University, one of the three critics.   “The government will achieve little from the current ban,” Pavin told Reuters. “If Facebook complies, it will be condemned by the international community. If Facebook ignores the request, then I guess the government will prove to the public that it is serious about this - expect more arrests of those who follow me.” Facebook has said its general guideline on receiving government requests to remove content is to determine whether the material violates local laws before restricting access. In 2016, Facebook blocked 50 pieces of content found to have violated the lese majeste law, following government requests. Since taking power, the military government has made increasing use of the royal insult law, which can carry a penalty of up to 15 years for each offence, against critics. Days after the May 2014 coup, the ministry of information and communications technology blocked access to Facebook temporarily, saying the military had ordered suspension of content critical of its actions.  The junta denied ordering the step.  "
2017-03-14,-6,"Facebook, its Instagram unit and rival Twitter Inc came under fire last year from privacy advocates after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a report that police were using location data and other user information to spy on protesters in places such as Ferguson, Missouri. In response to the ACLU report, the companies shut off the data access of Geofeedia, a Chicago-based data vendor that said it works with organizations to “leverage social media,” but Facebook policy had not explicitly barred such use of data in the future. “Our goal is to make our policy explicit,” Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in a post on the social network on Monday. He was not immediately available for an interview. The change would help build “a community where people can feel safe making their voices heard,” Sherman said. Racially charged protests broke out in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson in the aftermath of the August 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In a 2015 email message, a Geofeedia employee touted its “great success” covering the protests, according to the ACLU report based on government records. Representatives of Geofeedia could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. The company has worked with more than 500 law enforcement agencies, the ACLU said. Geofeedia Chief Executive Officer Phil Harris said in October that the company was committed to privacy and would work to build on civil rights protections. Major social media platforms including Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken action or implemented policies similar to Facebook‘s, said Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California. Ozer praised the companies’ action but said they should have stopped such use of data earlier. “It shouldn’t take a public records request from the ACLU for these companies to know what their developers are doing,” she said. It was also unclear how the companies would enforce their policies, said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a nonprofit that opposes government use of social media for surveillance. Inside corporations, “is the will there, without constant activist pressure, to enforce these rules?” Cyril said."
2017-07-25,2,"But far from being uneasy about the lofty heights the stock has scaled, traders instead have been busy betting on the shares to move higher. “The overall flavor of trading in Facebook’s options has been decidedly bullish,” said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade Financial Corp, in Chicago. “Traders have been looking to the upside consistently.” The bullish activity stands out even for a sector that has performed well this year, Russell said. There are about 1.7 Facebook call options open for each open put contract, the most since late April 2016, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. (For a graphic on 'Performance over last year: Facebook vs. S&P 500 Tech Sector' click reut.rs/2eLryu4) Much of the bullish positioning is concentrated in options contracts expiring in the near term. For contracts expiring between now and mid-September, calls account for nine of the 10 largest blocks of open contracts. Facebook’s weekly options contracts imply a 4.6 percent swing in the shares, in either direction, by Friday. That is in line with how much the shares have moved, on average, over the last eight quarters, the day after the company posts results. A move to the upside would snap a three-quarter losing streak, when the shares fell on the day after the company reported results. The bullish signal from the options market is in step with how most Wall Street analysts covering the stock view it. Of the 44 brokerages that cover the company, 40 have a positive recommendation on the shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. “We continue to like Facebook based on its continued usage gains, advertiser growth, emerging opportunities and ability to execute,” Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter said in a research note to clients on Monday. The brokerage raised its target price on Facebook shares to $175 from $160, and reaffirmed its ”outperform’ rating. "

Earlier this month, Facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 Facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after last year’s U.S. presidential election. The company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to Congress. U.S. congressional investigators and special counsel Robert Mueller are examining alleged Russian election interference, which Moscow has denied. Investigators are interested in other companies as well. Representatives for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are set to meet next week with staff from the Senate Intelligence Committee in relation to inquiries into the 2016 election.  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that he wants to hear from Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Twitter and others in public hearings.  “It will be important for the committee to scrutinize how rigorous Facebook’s internal investigation has been, to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did,” Schiff said in a statement. ‘WILD, WILD WEST’ The political advertising changes represent a retreat for Facebook, which for years has resisted calls from transparency advocates and academics for the regulation of political ads. The company has instead treated them like all commercial ads. In the days after the November 2016 U.S. election, Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that misinformation on Facebook swayed the vote toward President Donald Trump.  Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild West” and said legislation might be needed to address them.  Facebook has grown to be the leading online platform for political ads because of its low costs and tools for targeting messages to narrow audiences.  U.S. political campaigns likely spent $300 million on Facebook ads during the 2016 election cycle, according to Nomura analysts, though the exact amount is unknown.  It remained unclear whether Facebook’s voluntary changes would satisfy demands for government action.  Warner and another senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, on Thursday sent a letter to colleagues inviting them to be co-sponsors of legislation they are writing that would formalize and expand the commitments Zuckerberg made.  The legislation, they wrote, would require digital platforms with 1 million or more users to maintain a publicly available file of all election-related ads bought by people who spend more than $10,000, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.  Trevor Potter, president of the pro-transparency Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement that his group would “carefully monitor Facebook’s implementation of this new policy.” He said Facebook “helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the 2016 elections.” In the past, Facebook has argued that ad details had to remain confidential unless released by the advertisers. He said Facebook would hire 250 additional people; expand partnerships with election commissions around the world; and adapt systems to help deter political bullying.  Facebook has not found an attempt at election-meddling in Germany, Zuckerberg said, but he added that the company would continue to examine fake accounts that it has removed in advance of Sunday’s German national election.  “I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That’s not what we stand for,” Zuckerberg said.  Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said in a blog post on Thursday that it was unusual for Facebook to voluntarily turn over information to government authorities, as it was doing by giving U.S. lawmakers copies of ads. The company has long had a rigid policy of refusing to turn over any user information without a court order or other legal process.   But ultimately, Stretch wrote, “We believe the public deserves a full accounting of what happened in the 2016 election.” "

A Facebook spokeswoman said the company on Saturday had “unpublished” one page related to Guo and temporarily restricted his ability to post information on a profile page because “personal identifier information” had appeared on them in violation of Facebook’s community standards. “We want people to feel free to share and connect on Facebook, as well as feel safe, so we don’t allow people to publish the personal information of others without their consent,” she said on Monday. The spokeswoman declined to say where the initial complaint about the content on Guo’s page and profile had come from, but added that anyone could report a potential violation to the company which it would evaluate. The Chinese authorities have been trying to repatriate Guo, who applied for U.S. political asylum in September. In April, at Beijing’s request, Interpol issued a “red notice” seeking Guo’s arrest on corruption-related charges.Guo, who left China in 2014, did not immediately reply to a request for a comment.

2017-09-22,-13,"Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook that the company’s stock had performed well enough that he could fund his philanthropy by selling stock for at least 20 years and still retain voting control of the company. In December 2015 Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician, pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to charity.  According to court records, Zuckerberg owns more than 400 million shares of Facebook. That would value his holdings at a minimum of $68.2 billion, based on the company’s closing share on Friday of $170.54. Zuckerberg said he wanted to help solve global challenges “like curing all diseases in our children’s lifetime and personalizing education for every student.” Zuckerberg said that over about the next 18 months he planned to sell 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook, which at Friday’s closing price would raise $13 billion.  The decision came as Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, in a shareholder lawsuit seeking to halt the Class C stock plan, which had been approved by shareholders. Sjunde AP-Fonden, a Swedish national pension fund, and The Amalgamated Bank sued last year, saying that Zuckerberg should have to pay for the right to retain control while selling stock. ”We brought this case challenging a significant change in Facebook corporate governance, and by agreeing to abandon the reclassification we got everything we could have hoped to get,” said Lee Rudy of shareholder law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check. Rudy said the Class C proposal was rejected by 80 percent of minority shareholders in a vote last year. Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of Facebook’s stockholder vote, which helped carry the proposal. Google, now Alphabet Inc, proposed a similar stock reclassification in 2012, and court records show that Facebook’s general counsel suggested Zuckerberg could use it as a model for Facebook.  Google settled with shareholders in a deal that included a $522 million dividend, payable under certain conditions. Withdrawing the share plan comes as Facebook faces pressure over advertisements on the social network and the role they may have played in last year’s U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump questioned on Friday the company’s decision to overhaul how it handles paid political ads amid investigations into alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections. "
2017-08-03,-5,"The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article. Facebook has been criticised as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September. On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany. “In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog. She added that Facebook would keep testing its “related article” feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news."

2017-10-04,0,"Facebook UK Ltd. had revenues in Britain of 842 million pounds in 2016, up from 202 million pounds in 2015, after it switched to booking sales to larger UK clients in Britain. In 2015, turnover was booked through Facebook’s European headquarters in Dublin and the British subsidiary’s revenue represented payments from the Dublin unit. Facebook UK Ltd. reported a current tax charge for 2016 of 5.1 million pounds, compared to 4.2 million pounds for 2015. The modest change in Facebook’s tax bill reflects the fact that the tax authority had already calculated Facebook had taxable profits, although these never generated actual cash tax obligations because of generous offsets related to share awards. The 2016 tax charge was also reduced by “additional expenses deductible for tax purposes” which the firm declined to outline. Facebook still books some sales to smaller clients via Dublin. European Union members are keen to stop technology giants like Google and Apple from operating almost tax free in the bloc.  The companies, which all say they follow tax rules, typically channel sales via countries like Ireland and Luxembourg whose light touch approach to taxation allows the companies to shift profits on to zero tax jurisdictions. This means they usually do not report profits in the countries where their salespeople and customers are based, making it impossible for hosts to tax them. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, has outlined options to tackle this including a tax on the companies’ turnover, a levy on online ads and withholding taxes. If other EU countries could prompt tech companies to report more profit in their jurisdictions, they could reap greater tax revenues than Britain has achieved because they have a less generous approach to deductions than Britain.

2017-03-13,-5,"In response to the ACLU report, the companies shut off the data access of Geofeedia, a Chicago-based data vendor that said it works with organizations to “leverage social media,” but Facebook policy had not explicitly barred such use of data in the future.  “Our goal is to make our policy explicit,” Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in a post on the social network on Monday. He was not immediately available for an interview.  The change would help build “a community where people can feel safe making their voices heard,” Sherman said. Racially charged protests broke out in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson in the aftermath of the August 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In a 2015 email message, a Geofeedia employee touted its “great success” covering the protests, according to the ACLU report based on government records. Representatives of Geofeedia could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. The company has worked with more than 500 law enforcement agencies, the ACLU said.  Geofeedia Chief Executive Officer Phil Harris said in October that the company was committed to privacy and would work to build on civil rights protections. Major social media platforms including Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube (GOOGL.O) have taken action or implemented policies similar to Facebook‘s, said Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California. Ozer praised the companies’ action but said they should have stopped such use of data earlier. “It shouldn’t take a public records request from the ACLU for these companies to know what their developers are doing,” she said. It was also unclear how the companies would enforce their policies, said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a nonprofit that opposes government use of social media for surveillance. Inside corporations, “is the will there, without constant activist pressure, to enforce these rules?” Cyril said.  "
2017-06-23,-2,"The new initiative will train non-governmental organizations to help them monitor and respond to extremist content and create a dedicated support desk so they can communicate directly with Facebook, the company said.  “There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook,” said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. “We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform.”  The British government has stepped up attacks on Silicon Valley internet companies for not acting quickly enough to take down extremist online propaganda and fostering “safe places” where extremists can breed following a string of attacks in recent months in London and Manchester. Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc have responded by saying they have made heavy investments and employed thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content over the past two years. Security analysts say the efforts have dramatically reduced the use of these platforms for jihadist recruitment efforts, although more work needs to be done. Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to enlist British public opinion to force the U.S. internet players to work more closely with the government rather than proposing new legislation or policies to assert greater control over the web. Earlier this week, May urged fellow European Union leaders at a meeting in Brussels to join her in putting pressure on tech companies to ‘rid terrorist material from the internet in all our languages’.  She called for the internet companies to shift from reactively removing content when they are notified of it, toward greater use of automatic detection and removal tools - and ultimately preventing it from appearing on their platforms in the first place. "
2017-04-28,-25,"The gruesome incident this week highlights how those most affected by offensive content are usually too distracted to report it to the authorities. It also exposes the challenges that live streaming content poses to both governments monitoring for offensive material on the internet and the companies that host online content. On Monday, in an abandoned building in the Thai seaside resort of Phuket, 20-year-old Wuttisan Wongtalay turned on Facebook Live from his mobile phone. Then he picked up his 11-month-old daughter in her pink dress, tied a rope around her neck and hanged her. A second short video briefly shows her lifeless body. After that, he turned off the camera and killed himself. For the family of little Natalie Triratana, removing the videos was the last thing on their minds when they first popped up on Wuttisan’s Facebook feed at around 4.50 p.m. on Monday. Her mother’s cousin, Suksan Buachanit, said he called Thailand’s 191 police hotline to ask for help locating the building. By the time police and relatives found it, it was too late. “A local reporter told me to report it (to Facebook) but we were all occupied at the scene,” Suksan told Reuters in Phuket. It took more than a day - and 370,000 views - before Facebook removed those few minutes of video. For the social media company, with nearly 2 billion users, it was yet another case that exposed the challenges of quickly spotting and removing offensive content. The killing of the baby in Thailand followed the live broadcast shooting of an elderly man in Cleveland, Ohio. In that incident, it took two hours to remove the video, bringing intense criticism on the social media giant and prompting it to promise “ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment”. It was unclear how many viewers alerted Facebook to the killing of the baby. Facebook did not respond to questions. But by the morning the baby’s murder had been reported in local media and was one of the most talked about stories in Thailand. Several local and international journalists told Reuters they had reported the videos to Facebook and asked the company for comment. The head of Thailand’s police’s Technology Crime Suppression Division, Supachet Chokchai, said he was alerted to the baby murder videos by police in Phuket but he declined to say when that was. The division monitors online content ranging from anti-monarchy content to fraudulent websites. It also has a hotline for the public to call in tip-offs about offensive content. Nor would Supachet say when police then asked the digital ministry to get in touch with Facebook. The ministry said by the time police reported the videos on Tuesday afternoon it had already heard about them from an anonymous tip-off and had told Facebook. The ministry contacted Facebook through a “direct channel” at noon on Tuesday, according to Somsak Khaosuwan, the ministry’s deputy permanent secretary. He did not elaborate on what the direct channel was or say whom the ministry contacted at Facebook. It was only just after 5.00 p.m. - about five hours later and more than a full day after the videos were first streamed - that Facebook took them down. Thai police said they would review ways to take down online content after the killing. Police blamed the delay partly on the time difference between the United States, where Facebook is headquartered, and Thailand. They did not explain at exactly which stage the time difference had proved problematic, however. A spokesman for the police also said the force was tight on staffing. Thailand, along with other authoritarian governments in Asia, is more geared up to monitor politically sensitive content online. Censorship has been ramped up since a 2014 coup and hundreds of websites have been blocked or shut down for content deemed inappropriate or offensive. Thailand is further tightening controls on internet users. This week, Thailand’s national telecoms regulator ordered all internet service providers to block web content deemed illegal by the courts within a week or face having their licenses revoked. Thailand is also working on a cyber security bill that would allow the state to conduct large-scale surveillance in the name of national security by wiretapping telephones and computers without the need for court approval.

2017-09-08,-4,"Facebook, which generates revenues from advertising based on data from its users’ social connections, opinions and activities, has said it complies with the law.  “I think we will present first results of this case before the end of this year,” Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt told a conference organized by the International Bar Association. Companies can be fined up to 10 percent of their annual turnover by the German competition regulator if found guilty of abusing a dominant market position, though it has never imposed the maximum penalty. "
2017-07-28,-18,"This year, the Big Two in internet advertising are expected to take half of all revenue worldwide, and more than 60 percent in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer.  In the U.S. market, no other digital ad platform has market share above 5 percent. Google suffered a minor blip in earnings due to higher payments to mobile carriers and others for search traffic. But efforts by Verizon and other network operators to compete for mobile ad dollars have had little impact thus far.  Independent advertising technology companies such as Rubicon Project (RUBI.N) and Rocket Fuel FUEL.O have also found it tough to compete. Advertisers are flocking to Facebook and Google because they reach billions of people and have a wealth of data that can be deployed for targeted marketing. Their growing dominance, however, raises questions about how they will use their billions in profits to maintain growth when the advertising market as a whole is expanding only modestly. “Digital advertising will soon be approaching a point of saturation, indicating that there are limits to growth which may not be fully accounted for by the investment community,” Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said in a client note this week. The advent of a duopoly is also spurring concerns about monopolistic practices. Google this month set aside $2.7 billion to pay a record European Union antitrust fine for favoring its shopping service in search results, and it faces two additional investigations in Europe. Facebook declined to comment on Friday. In the past, the company has rejected the idea that it is part of a duopoly, saying that it competes against more than just digital platforms and has less than 5 percent of the overall advertising market. Alphabet did not reply to requests for comment. Facebook is expected to launch original video series of its own within weeks, after signing deals with companies such as Vox Media and BuzzFeed. Facebook’s Instagram unit is also becoming a bigger producer of revenue, with video likely to be a big part of the mix. Already, many advertisers feel they cannot ignore the massive reach of YouTube. Some big advertisers launched a boycott of YouTube this year after their ads appeared alongside videos from Islamic extremists, yet there was no evidence from Alphabet’s earnings report on Monday that it had any impact on revenues. “Marketers aren’t going to get fired for hiring Facebook and Google,” said Harry Kargman, chief executive of Kargo, which manages digital marketing for media companies including Time Inc (TIME.N). Consumer advocates worry about the giants snuffing out competition. “All of the major technology companies should be on alert that people are a bit spooked and unsettled about their size and their ability to expand into new markets,” said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for an open internet.  Size is not by itself an antitrust concern, and neither is the ability to quash competitors, even through copying as Facebook has done with rival app Snapchat. Facebook and Google are not under U.S. antitrust investigation. Still, the prospect of a future probe could still affect their business strategies.  “As long as they toe the line and stay in the market position they’re in, it’s going to be kind of hard to go after them under the existing antitrust laws,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Pennsylvania professor of antitrust law. But acquisitions, he said, would be another matter.  “Even a merger between Facebook or Google and a smaller rival would probably be looked at very closely,” Hovenkamp said.  "
2017-06-07,-11,"The head of the world’s largest social networking company met with Lola Omolola, who is based in Chicago, and posted late on Tuesday about Female IN (FIN), which was founded in 2015. “It’s a no-judgment space ... helping end the culture of silence that exists for women in some parts of the world,” the 33-year-old billionaire said in a post on his Facebook page.    Zuckerberg, who visited Nigeria last year, said he would be meeting more Facebook group leaders such as Omolola at the first ever Facebook Communities Summit later this month in Chicago.  The summit will help group administrators to “do even more to build community ... and common understanding”, he added. In response to Zuckerberg’s post, Omolola said Facebook had helped women worldwide to find their voices through the FIN group, and thanked the entrepreneur for “helping me create the world I wish to live in and have my 8 and 10 year old inherit”.  Although the FIN group is secret - meaning that only members can invite others to join and view its content - Omolola said in a public video that it aimed to disrupt the status quo and change the landscape in communities where women are not heard.  “I come from a community where lots of the time women have a lot to say, but we have been conditioned and we have been raised to keep silent, because someone is going to get embarrassed by something we say,” Omolola said in the video interview with Facebook’s diversity director, Maxine Williams. Nigeria’s Senate last year threw out a gender and equality law that pledged to end discrimination in politics, education and employment, protect women’s rights and tackle violence against women after lawmakers opposed it on religious grounds. Women’s rights activists said the dismissal showed the government was ignoring the dangers facing Nigerian women, ranging from sexual assault and abduction to forced marriages.  "
2017-06-22,-4,"“Advertisers consider their ad creatives and their ad targeting strategy to be competitively sensitive and confidential,” Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about political ads.  “In many cases, they’ll ask us, as a condition of running ads on Facebook, not to disclose those details about how they’re running campaigns on our service,” he said. “From our perspective, it’s confidential information of these advertisers.”  Sherman said it would not make an exception for political advertising. “We try to have consistent policies across the board, so that we’re imposing similar requirements on everybody.”  Academics who study political campaigns worldwide said this kind of information fosters accountability by analyzing how candidates compete for votes and whether election systems live up to expectations of fairness. Transparency can also deter fraudulent ads, they said.  “We don’t have the capacity right now to track it, and nobody does, as far as we can tell,” said Bowdoin College professor Michael Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which catalogs political ads on traditional television but has no means of doing so on Facebook. Television has been the backbone of political advertising  for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of ads. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets.  Online advertising, though, often targets narrow, more carefully constructed audiences, so for example an ad could be directed only to Democrats under 25 years of age.  Thousands of variations of online ads can be directed at select groups and the targeting can be extreme. Academics argue this is where the process can become very opaque. “Candidates can speak out of both sides of their mouths,” said Daniel Kreiss, a communications professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “Having some kind of digital repository of ads that are purchased during a particular cycle and linked to a particular source is a good, democratic thing for the public.” No such repository exists, and the quandary for researchers is expected to worsen as more politicians use digital advertising because of its relatively low cost and opportunities for target marketing.  According to U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, $70 million was spent for its ads on Facebook, more than on any other digital platform including Google (GOOGL.O), and Trump has credited Facebook with helping him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton last November.  Advertising on Facebook also figured prominently in recent elections in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, researchers said.  Britain is investigating how candidates use data to target voters. Facebook ads generally disappear with the scroll of a thumb on a smartphone, and they have no permanent links. Advocates for transparency call them “dark ads.” Facebook calls them “unpublished posts.”  Researchers said that disclosure reports from the U.S. Federal Election Commission are unhelpful because they show what campaigns pay to intermediaries, not to internet platforms.  The role of advertising online is as important to study as the effect of so-called “fake news,” which has received more attention than ads, scholars said.  “The holy grail, I think, of political analysis for the 2016 election is to figure out which communications from which entities had an effect on which jurisdictions in the United States,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University professor who writes about elections.  Facebook has such information and should make it available for study, Persily said.  Facebook’s Sherman said the company was open to hearing research proposals, but he doubted much could be achieved. “Even if we were able to be more transparent in this area, it would only be a very small piece of an overall story,” he said. "
2017-06-22,-4,"“Advertisers consider their ad creatives and their ad targeting strategy to be competitively sensitive and confidential,” Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about political ads.  “In many cases, they’ll ask us, as a condition of running ads on Facebook, not to disclose those details about how they’re running campaigns on our service,” he said. “From our perspective, it’s confidential information of these advertisers.”  Sherman said it would not make an exception for political advertising. “We try to have consistent policies across the board, so that we’re imposing similar requirements on everybody.”  Academics who study political campaigns worldwide said this kind of information fosters accountability by analyzing how candidates compete for votes and whether election systems live up to expectations of fairness. Transparency can also deter fraudulent ads, they said.  “We don’t have the capacity right now to track it, and nobody does, as far as we can tell,” said Bowdoin College professor Michael Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which catalogs political ads on traditional television but has no means of doing so on Facebook. Television has been the backbone of political advertising  for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of ads. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets.  Online advertising, though, often targets narrow, more carefully constructed audiences, so for example an ad could be directed only to Democrats under 25 years of age.  Thousands of variations of online ads can be directed at select groups and the targeting can be extreme. Academics argue this is where the process can become very opaque. “Candidates can speak out of both sides of their mouths,” said Daniel Kreiss, a communications professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “Having some kind of digital repository of ads that are purchased during a particular cycle and linked to a particular source is a good, democratic thing for the public.” No such repository exists, and the quandary for researchers is expected to worsen as more politicians use digital advertising because of its relatively low cost and opportunities for target marketing.  According to U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, $70 million was spent for its ads on Facebook, more than on any other digital platform including Google (GOOGL.O), and Trump has credited Facebook with helping him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton last November.  Advertising on Facebook also figured prominently in recent elections in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, researchers said.  Britain is investigating how candidates use data to target voters. Facebook ads generally disappear with the scroll of a thumb on a smartphone, and they have no permanent links. Advocates for transparency call them “dark ads.” Facebook calls them “unpublished posts.”  Researchers said that disclosure reports from the U.S. Federal Election Commission are unhelpful because they show what campaigns pay to intermediaries, not to internet platforms.  The role of advertising online is as important to study as the effect of so-called “fake news,” which has received more attention than ads, scholars said.  “The holy grail, I think, of political analysis for the 2016 election is to figure out which communications from which entities had an effect on which jurisdictions in the United States,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University professor who writes about elections.  Facebook has such information and should make it available for study, Persily said.  Facebook’s Sherman said the company was open to hearing research proposals, but he doubted much could be achieved. “Even if we were able to be more transparent in this area, it would only be a very small piece of an overall story,” he said.

2017-10-11,1,"Facebook has invested heavily in virtual reality hardware in hopes the technology, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view of faraway or imaginary spaces, will move from a niche interest to a widely used platform for gaming, communication and business applications.  In 2014, Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees.  The Oculus Go is billed as simpler than the Rift, which went on sale last year, or the Vive system made by HTC Corp (2498.TW). Both of those require desktop computers to operate.  “I think you’re going to see these a lot on airplanes, because it’s way better than the back-of-the-seat monitor or my phone,” Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, said in an interview.  Schroepfer said the device is aimed at people who do not have Samsung smartphones. Oculus and Samsung Electronics Co 005939.KS already sell a device, named Gear VR, that when paired with certain Samsung phones is similar to Oculus Go.  Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) offers a rival headset, Google Daydream, that works with yet more smartphones. “The Oculus Go has potential to be a huge driver of growth,” if people like the titles and apps on it, Stephanie Llamas, vice president of research at Super Data, said in an email.  Facebook will permanently cut the price of the Rift system to $399 from $499, the company said.  Facebook is expected to ship 213,000 Rift systems this year, while HTC is expected to ship 305,000 Vive systems, according to Super Data research.  Beyond price cuts and new products, Facebook is trying different ways to attract people to the virtual-reality medium.  The company is developing software known as Facebook Spaces that allows friends to meet in virtual rooms, and it said it will soon integrate live video.  On Wednesday, the company said it was releasing technology to create better, customized facial images, or avatars, and would soon add the ability to use playing cards in Facebook Spaces, in addition to the dice it already has.  "
2017-11-22,0,"Africa’s rapid population growth, falling data costs and heavy adoption of mobile phones rather than PCs is attracting technology companies looking to attract more users.   Facebook did not provide details of the period over which its planned training would take place in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country with 180 million inhabitants.   “We understand the important role Facebook plays here in Nigeria with developers and start-ups and are invested in helping these communities,” Emeka Afigbo, its regional head of platform partnership, said in a statement on Wednesday. Facebook said the training - aimed at software developers, entrepreneurs and students - would be offered in cities including the capital, Abuja, Port Harcourt in the south, Calabar in the southeast and Kaduna in the north.  Last year Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited technology companies in Lagos and his charitable foundation provided $24 million to Andela, which trains developers.  Google’s chief executive in a July visit to Lagos said the company aimed to train 10 million people across the continent in online skills over the next five years. He also said it hoped to train 100,000 software developers in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.  Although Africa may not offer as much opportunity to add consumers as China or India, because large wealth gaps mean that many people in places like Nigeria have little disposable income, Facebook said more than 22 million people already use its social media website every month in Nigeria.   Widespread poverty means mobile adoption tends to favor basic phone models. That, combined with poor telecommunications infrastructure, can mean slow internet speeds and less internet surfing, which tech firms rely on to make money.  "
2017-11-02,-15,"Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg condemned Russia’s attempts to influence last year’s election through Facebook posts and advertisements designed to sow division, and repeated his pledge to ramp up spending to confront the problem. Zuckerberg said that spending would include 10,000 additional people to review content on the network, though based on past practice many of those people will be contractors. The spending would hit profits, Facebook said, with expenses expected to grow by 45 percent to 60 percent next year. “What they did is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it,” Zuckerberg said of the Russians, on a conference call with analysts. The company’s share price, which hit a record $182.90 earlier on Wednesday, initially rose in after-hours trading, but later fell into negative territory on discussion of the higher spending. Shares have gained almost 60 percent this year. “While the investigations into Russian activity on the platform have been getting a lot of attention, they’re not detracting from Facebook’s power as an ad platform,” analyst Debra Aho Williamson of research firm eMarketer said in an interview.  The political storm in the United States over how Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google handle false news stories and political manipulation of their services gathered strength this week as three separate congressional committees held hearings.  Zuckerberg did not appear at the hearings. But lawmakers  threatened tougher regulation and fired questions at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, excoriating the company for being slow to act and slow to share what it knew with Congress. The chief executive told analysts that legislation to force disclosure of election ads “would be very good if done well.”  In a series of disclosures over two months, Facebook has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years. Russia denies any meddling. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $9.71 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet. Facebook in the third quarter gave advertisers for the first time the ability to run ads in standalone videos, outside the Facebook News Feed, and the company is seeing good early results, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts.  More than 70 percent of ad breaks up to 15 seconds long were viewed to completion, most with the sound on, she said.  Facebook executives, though, declined to give details on the performance so far of Watch, a video tab the company rolled out two months ago. “It’s too early to be talking about any stats there,” Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in response to an analyst question.  Zuckerberg said Facebook would be spending heavily in making the Watch tab a place where “people want to talk and connect around,” rather than a spot to passively consume programs.  The 49 percent increase in total ad sales in the latest quarter compares with a 47 percent rise in the prior quarter and a 51 percent jump in the first quarter. Facebook has been warning for more than a year about reaching a limit in “ad load”, or the number of ads the company can feature in users’ pages before crowding their News Feed. Advertisers seem unfazed, though, spending heavily as the social network continues to attract users. The average price per ad rose 35 percent.  The nearly 50 percent jump in ad revenue “is phenomenal, especially when for the past few quarters they’ve been trying to bring that expectation way, way down. Yet it keeps going up,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.  Of the Russia scandal enveloping Facebook publicly, Feinseth said: “In the bigger picture, I don’t think it’s a really big factor.”  The company’s performance was strong in comparison with smaller social media firms Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.  “Facebook grew revenues by $3.3 billion year-over-year for the quarter. This is more than Twitter and Snapchat generate combined for the full year,” he said.  Facebook said about 2.07 billion people were using its service monthly, up 16 percent from a year earlier. Net income rose to $4.71 billion, or $1.59 per share, from $2.63 billion, or 90 cents per share. Analysts on an average were expecting the company to earn $1.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue increased 47.3 percent to $10.33 billion beating analysts’ estimate of $9.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  "
2017-07-10,-9,"Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price.  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would “become a part of daily life for billions of people.”  Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy.  The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said: “We’re now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.”  Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March.  In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers.  Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement. Oculus has asked for a new trial.  "
2017-05-17,-7,"The EU executive and Facebook declined to comment.  During regulatory scrutiny of the WhatsApp deal in 2014, Facebook told the EU competition enforcer it was unable reliably to match the two companies’ user accounts.  The Commission subsequently found that this was technically  possible at the time.  Regulators met this week on the case and a decision could come either this week or next, the person said. The Commission can fine a company as much as 1 percent of its global turnover, which in Facebook’s case could reach $276 million based on its 2016 revenue.  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in March told a news conference that a small handful of companies may have provided misleading information when they sought approval for their mergers. The EU sanction will come on the heels of a 150,000-euro fine handed down by a French data watchdog to Facebook on Tuesday for failing to prevent its users’ data being accessed by advertisers. Italian antitrust authorities levied a 3-million-euro fine on WhatsApp last week for allegedly obliging users to agree to share their personal data with Facebook. "
2017-07-12,-3,"While Zuckerberg, 33, is a vocal supporter of renewable energy development, he said the visit gave him an opportunity to meet with those who rely on oil and natural gas production for their livelihood and oppose tighter regulation of the energy industry. “Many people I talked to here acknowledged (climate change), but also feel a sense of pride that their work contributes to serving real needs we all have every day - keeping our homes warm, getting to work, feeding us and more,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post early Wednesday morning. The Facebook co-founder flew his private jet into Williston, the de facto capital of the state’s oil industry, and toured a nearby drilling rig operated by Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) and an oil well owned by Statoil ASA (STL.OL). Zuckerberg spent more than two hours with roughnecks on the drilling rig, asking about technology developments that have helped the U.S. shale industry in the past two years cut in half the time needed to drill a new oil well. Representatives for Nabors and Statoil were not immediately available to comment. In a picture accompanying the Facebook post, Zuckerberg can be seen wearing the oilfield uniform of fire-resistant coveralls and a hard hat. He is not wearing safety glasses or gloves but holds them in his left hand, a violation of rig safety rules.     “Zuckerberg was extremely intrigued by all the technological developments in the oilfields,” said Ron Ness, head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, the industry trade group that arranged the tour with Facebook. Zuckerberg later held a community meeting to discuss education and housing. Politicians were not allowed to attend. The months-long delay of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which transports the state’s Bakken crude oil, was also a main topic.     “A number of people told me they had felt their livelihood was blocked by the government, but when (President Donald) Trump approved the pipeline, they felt a sense of hope again,” Zuckerberg said.   "
2017-03-09,3,"“I cannot think of a greater gift than having a sister and I‘m so happy Max and our new child will have each other,” Zuckerberg, who grew up with three sisters, wrote. Their first daughter, Max, briefly entered the spotlight last year when Zuckerberg posted a photo of her getting immunization shots and was inundated with Facebook users debating the merits of vaccines. The announcement came on the same day that Facebook shares hit an all-time of $138.57, riding upbeat expectations for growth as well as recent gains in the broader market. Zuckerberg has a net worth of $57.8 billion, according to Forbes magazine, although in 2015 he pledged to put 99 percent of his Facebook shares into a new philanthropy project focusing on human potential and equality.  "
2017-09-25,-12,"However reached, it is the right decision. When the new stock plan was put to a vote, some 80 percent of minority shareholders – who actually lay claim to a majority of the company’s economics - rejected it. Although Zuckerberg was able to override them with his more than 400 million Class B shares, an incontrovertible message was delivered. It’s the same spirit that recently inspired the arbiters of the S&P 500, America’s most influential stock benchmark, to no longer admit companies that violate the one-share, one-vote principle.  Zuckerberg’s turn toward less shareholder-friendly behavior was naturally mitigated by the extraordinary performance of Facebook stock since he first surfaced the plan in April 2016. The shares gained some 50 percent over that period, creating $220 billion of additional market capitalization. That enriched Zuckerberg by around $30 billion. So he can indeed afford to sell fewer shares while still harvesting a charitable pile for the ages. At current prices, for instance, he’d need to sell 60 million or so shares to raise $10 billion. When he first hatched the plan, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan would have needed to sell 90 million.  Nonetheless, it would be naïve to ascribe this act to a sudden bolt of altruism and a bull market. There are, in fact, two valid reasons - one tactical, the other strategic - for Zuckerberg and his chums on the board to reconsider. The first is the shareholder lawsuit against the plan, which was nearing its day in court. The second is a larger debate over Facebook’s lightly regulated business model in light of recent evidence that it may have abetted Russian agents seeking to influence last year’s U.S. presidential election though advertisements on its website.  The lawsuit was already damaging for Facebook. Discovery suggested that some of its directors were more concerned with safeguarding Zuckerberg’s interests than those of shareholders owning 85 percent of the company. Board member Marc Andreessen, who was on the special committee assessing the zero-stock proposal, allegedly passed along committee questions in advance and sent Zuckerberg text messages during the meetings to coach him. Andreessen also allegedly warned the CEO about committee concerns over his trying to find a way to keep a firm grip on Facebook after leaving the firm.  At a minimum, the revelations made a mockery of Facebook’s governance. They also could have undermined its legal case. Either way, a trial would have opened Facebook to greater scrutiny and tied up many of its executives and legal advisers at a moment when there are more pressing issues than Zuckerberg’s personal stock portfolio. Facebook could even have lost the case, which would have been doubly embarrassing to Zuckerberg and called into question the fitness of some Facebook directors.  The more strategic reason to abandon the plan is the one that most probably explains why, after giving the majority of shareholders what they wanted, Facebook’s stock slipped 5 percent on Monday. Facebook recently agreed to hand over documents related to advertisements that may have been taken out by Russian entities seeking to influence the election. As a result, legislators from both parties in the U.S. Congress are considering various ways to circumscribe its influence.  New rules might not dent Facebook's profitability in the near term, but they could have an effect similar to the one Microsoft endured 15 years ago when it became the focus of politicians and regulators globally. As my colleagues pointed out on Friday, Microsoft continued to expand its bottom line but its owners declined to rate its future income at the same 30 times multiple that had made it one of the most valuable companies in the world.  Avoiding that sort of outcome should be the bigger concern for Zuckerberg and his board. A falling stock price doesn’t just unnerve investors who might be willing to overlook substandard governance. It means Zuckerberg and his wife will have fewer billions to devote to making the world a better place, and that includes adopting a more inclusive form of capitalism."
2017-05-31,-2,"Privacy remains a sensitive issue in Germany due to extensive surveillance by Communist East Germany’s Stasi secret police and by the Nazi era Gestapo. Memories of espionage were stirred anew by Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations of prying by the United States. In the Facebook case, the mother of a 15-year-old who was hit and killed by a subway train in Berlin in 2012 had sought access to her daughter’s account to search for clues as to whether the girl had committed suicide. Facebook had refused access to the account, which had been memorialized, meaning it was effectively locked and served as a message board for friends and family to share memories. A regional court in Berlin had ruled in favor of the mother in late 2015, saying that the daughter’s contract with Facebook passed to her parents according to German laws on inheritance. It had also said that the girl’s right to privacy was not protected because she was a minor and it was up to her parents to protect her rights. The appeals court said on Wednesday that the right to private telecommunications outweighed the right to inheritance, and that the parents’ obligation to protect their daughter’s rights expired with her death. "
2017-09-27,-6,"“These actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election – but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people’s News Feeds,” the Facebook executive said in a statement. News feed is the central feature in user profiles whereby they can see updates from people they follow. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union secured victory in Sunday’s balloting with fewer votes than expected, forcing her to enter complicated coalition talks with various parties to form a new government. The company said it made a stronger push to remove fake accounts when it observed suspicious activity following widely reported foreign interference in the French and U.S. presidential elections over the past year. Besides seeking to encourage civic participation and voter education efforts, it also worked closely with authorities, including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), to monitor security threats during the campaign.  “Studies concluded that the level of false news was low,” concluded Allan, a former British member of parliament who, in addition to his work for Facebook, has been a member of the House of Lords since 2010. A variety of German political experts and social media watchers had given the campaign largely a clean bill of health in terms of any wide-scale efforts to swing votes in the run-up to voting day.

2017-05-08,-12,"Ahead of the June 8 parliamentary election in Britain, it urged its users in the country to be skeptical of headlines that look unbelievable and to check other sources before sharing news that may not be credible. It said it would also delete bogus profiles and stop promoting posts that show signs of being implausible. “We have developed new ways to identify and remove fake accounts that might be spreading false news so that we get to the root of the problem,” said Simon Milner, Facebook’s director of policy for the UK. The effort builds on the company’s recently expanded campaigns to identify fake news and crack down on automated profile pages that post commercial or political spam.  With the headline “Tips for spotting false news”, the adverts in Britain listed 10 ways to identify whether a story was genuine or not, including looking closely at a URL, investigating the source, looking for unusual formatting and considering the authenticity of the photo. Facebook said it had taken action against tens of thousands of fake accounts in Britain after identifying patterns of activity such as whether the same content is being repeatedly posted.  “With these changes, we expect we will also reduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts,” Facebook said.  Social media sites including Twitter and YouTube are also facing pressure in Europe where governments are threatening new laws and fines unless the companies move more quickly to remove extremist content.  Facebook has hired more staff to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts. "
2017-08-04,-8,"Final polls have shown a tight race between both candidates after months of campaigning where supporters smeared each other on social media. The torture and murder of a senior official at the electoral commission last weekend generated an avalanche of conspiracy theories and accusations. A survey of 2,000 Kenyans carried out through mobile phone messaging found that nine out of every 10 respondents had seen fake news and half of consumers got news through social media, according to a study by Geopoll and Portland Communications last month.  “Fake news is increasingly becoming a big problem in Kenya,” said Alphonce Shiundu, the Kenya editor of Africa Check, a non-profit organization seeking to boost fact checking and newsgathering on the continent.  Facebook’s 7 million monthly users in Kenya will see the new tool to help them evaluate content displayed prominently when they log on. It leads to a page with tips on how to spot fake news, including checking web addresses and sources and looking for other reports on the topic, Facebook said in a statement. The new tool will be complemented by adverts in newspapers and radio stations. The announcements will be in both English and the local Swahili language.  Fake news, mainly generated by website owners in order to drive readers to their sites to generate advertising revenue, was thrust into the spotlight during the U.S. presidential election last year. The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September. Firms like Facebook have fought back by cutting financial incentives for sources of fake news, locking fake user accounts, limiting spam and reducing links to suspect pages.  “People want to see accurate information on Facebook,” said Ebele Okobi, director of policy at Facebook Africa. Kenya’s electoral commission said it had been a victim of online fake news but it did not provide details.  Recent examples of fake election news for Kenya include a photograph of a crumbling bridge in a section of a new $3.2 billion railway that Kenyatta touts as one of his main achievements, Africa Check said. A fake document claiming the company that organized a television debate that Kenyatta snubbed was owned by key Odinga allies was also an example of fake news, the organization said. “From the kinds of things that we have seen doing rounds online, on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and websites mimicking real news sites, we get the sense that there’s a lot of false content about the elections,” Shiundu said.

2017-09-26,-10,"Posts for the period between Aug. 1 and Aug. 29 appear to have been “hidden” on the Facebook page of the office of the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, which has covered the military’s actions, including those in western Myanmar, in detailed dispatches. The posts, which can still be found using specific date or keyword searches, included detailed accounts of the operation launched by the army following attacks on security forces on Aug. 25. It is unclear why, or when exactly, the posts disappeared. They were not visible on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday from several locations across Asia. “We don’t hide anything, it might be some kind of error,” said Ministry of Defence spokesman General Aung Ye Win. Zaw Htay, the spokesman for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, referred questions to Aung Ye Win. A spokesman for the military-run home affairs ministry, Police Colonel Myo Thu Soe, said he “had no idea” about the issue. A Facebook spokesperson said it was at the discretion of page administrators to hide posts if they wished. Around 480,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since the military counter-offensive began. The United Nations has described the campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has rejected that accusation, saying it is waging a legitimate fight against terrorists. A U.N.-mandated fact-finding mission is looking into “alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces and abuses in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine State”. The probe includes the violence that followed the Aug. 25 attacks. It was established after a similar, smaller military operation late last year. Like other news organisations, Reuters had used the detailed, timely postings in much of its early coverage of the August crisis. The August posts can still be seen if searched for with a specific date or a keyword, suggesting they have not been deleted but removed from the page’s timeline using Facebook’s “hide” function. “Keep in mind that if a post you’ve hidden was shared, it may still be visible to the audience it was shared with in other places on Facebook,” says Facebook about the function on its website. The feature can be undone by the account holder to restore the posts. The hidden August posts include very detailed accounts of clashes with militants, often accompanied by pictures. The military first posted on the attacks on Aug. 25, attaching a map showing police posts and military base that had been attacked. The timeline updates resume on the military page after Aug. 31, with more than 360 posts in September, mostly about operations in Rakhine. Myawady, a media group which covers the military and publishes daily newspapers, has kept the August issues available online.

2017-09-22,0,"“We do not know ... how to place an advert on Facebook. We have never done this, and the Russian side has never been involved in it,” Peskov told a conference call with reporters. "
2017-09-22,-11,"Earlier this month, Facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 Facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to Congress but said on Thursday it would do so, making a concession to U.S. lawmakers who have threatened to regulate the world’s largest social network over ads that run during election campaigns. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on Facebook, no matter whom they target. Facebook also will demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under U.S. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia engaged in cyber attacks to sway the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton in favor of Trump. U.S. congressional investigators and a special counsel are investigating the matter. Moscow has denied any interference. While Trump dismissed the advertisement controversy, his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, expressed concern. “Well, I think all of these social media providers are faced with many challenges,” Tillerson said on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” pointing to their use by militant groups around the world as well as in election campaigns.  “But they also have responsibilities,” he said. “And I think they’re going to have to think carefully about their responsibilities in this regard.” U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.

2017-06-27,0,"Social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc have beefed up their focus on signing live-streaming sports deals as young audience increasingly rely on the internet to watch sports ditching the traditional cable services. Fox Sports will stream UEFA Champions League matches in the United States on its Facebook pages, starting in September, according to the deal. The partnership includes two live matches per day in the group stage, four round of 16 matches and four quarterfinal matches, Fox said. As an attempt to further push into live video, Facebook also struck a deal, last month, with Major League Baseball to show 20 of the league’s games live this season. Twitter also chalked out a live streaming deal with the Canadian Football League (CFL) on Tuesday to stream a 30-minute live show featuring football news, player interviews and stories about the league, the CFL said. The microblogging website had signed a multi-year deal, last month, with the U.S. National Football League to live-stream pre-game coverage as well as a 30-minute show. "
2017-07-26,-13,"The initiative, dubbed Defending Digital Democracy, is led by the former campaign chairs for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Mitt Romney, and will initially be based at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, which announced the project last week. Facebook said it hoped additional participants would turn it into a freestanding information-sharing center controlled by its members. Facebook, with 2 billion monthly users, bills itself as a vehicle for political debate and education, but was also used as a major platform to spread fake news and propaganda during the U.S. presidential race. Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced the company’s backing at the opening of the Black Hat information security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The event, named after the term for malicious hackers, is aimed mainly at corporate and government security professionals. Stamos declined to say how much money the Facebook would spend. “Right now we are the founding sponsor, but we are in discussions with other tech organizations,” Stamos said in an interview before the speech. “The goal for our money specifically is to help build a standalone ISAO (Information Sharing and Analysis Organization) that pulls in all the different groups that have some kind of vulnerability.” The project will be managed by Eric Rosenbach, a former assistant secretary of defense who is co-director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “Most campaigns don’t have the tools right now to defend themselves from cyber attacks,” Clinton campaign chair Robby Mook said in an email. “Our initiative aims to fill that void and to help both Democratic and Republican campaigns defend themselves with greater information-sharing and security tools.” “This is a forward-looking and bipartisan effort to tackle a real problem,” said 2012 Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades in an email. Stamos also urged Black Hat attendees, many of whom are leery of government intrusion, to be more open-minded about helping law enforcement track criminals and terrorists. Unthinking rejection of official requests could lead to legislation forcing companies to break their own encryption, Stamos warned. Stamos said he would continue to argue against such steps. “We’re not going to be effective unless we demonstrate that we have the same goals,” he said. “I want to present our position that strong cryptography is a critical part of building a safe, trustworthy future.” (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Richard Chang)"

2017-10-24,-12,"“Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,” Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee. He asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed. “I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” wrote Collins. The committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7. The inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources. The issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations. Facebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election. In Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks. Last week, another member of parliament, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference”. Russia has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. "
2017-10-11,-12,"By Mark Hosenball and Dustin Volz WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation said Wednesday they intend to publicly release thousands of politically divisive Facebook ads purchased by Russia during last year’s presidential election. Representatives Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff told reporters after meeting with Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg that they were working with the company to release the ads publicly. “We’ve asked for Facebook’s help to scrub any personally identifiable information, but it’s our hope that when that concludes we can release them publicly,” Schiff said. Conaway said it was unlikely the ads would be released before Facebook will testify to Congress about Russian interference on Nov. 1. The committee, one of the main congressional panels investigating allegations of Russian meddling, recently received more than 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been purchased by Russia. The social media company found them on its network and said they appeared in the months before and after the vote. Lawmakers in both parties had previously said they wanted to make the ads public. Officials from Facebook and the committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sandberg’s meeting in Congress came as the world’s largest social media network, joined by a growing list of other major internet firms, finds itself on the defensive in Washington amid renewed scrutiny about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election. Sandberg is in Washington this week meeting with other lawmakers as well. She is expected to give a live interview with the news website Axios on Thursday. In addition to Facebook, Alphabet’s  Google and Twitter have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. All three companies have been asked to testify publicly about Russian interference before both the House and Senate intelligence panels on Nov. 1. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not. Revelations over the past month about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda have prompted questions from both political parties about whether more federal oversight of their businesses is needed. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms. "
2017-06-05,-2,"May responded to the attack by calling for an overhaul of the strategy used to combat extremism, including a demand for greater international regulation of the internet, saying big internet companies were partly responsible for providing extreme ideology the space to develop. Facebook on Sunday said it condemned the London attacks. “We want Facebook to be a hostile environment for terrorists,” said Simon Milner, Director of Policy at Facebook in an emailed statement. May has previously put pressure on internet firms to take more responsibility for content posted on their services. Last month she pledged, if she wins an upcoming election, to create the power to make firms pay towards the cost of policing the internet with an industry-wide levy. Twitter also said it was working to tackle the spread of militant propaganda on its website. “Terrorist content has no place on Twitter,” Nick Pickles, UK head of public policy at Twitter, said in a statement, adding that in the second half of 2016 it had suspended nearly 400,000 accounts. “We continue to expand the use of technology as part of a systematic approach to removing this type of content.”  "

The company has already lined up “Strangers”, a relationship drama, and a game show, “Last State Standing”, the report said. “We’re focused on episodic shows and helping all our partners understand what works across different verticals and topics,” said Nick Grudin, Facebook’s vice president for media partnerships. The company is also willing to share its viewership data with Hollywood, the report said.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) hired co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, earlier this month, to lead its video-programming efforts. Apple began its long-awaited move into original television series last week, with a reality show called “Planet of the Apps”, an unscripted show about developers trying to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The company’s future programing plans include an adaptation of comedian James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” segment from his CBS Corp (CBS.N) show that will begin airing in August. "

Nearly all cases of cyber bullying were linked to people known to victims from school or other parts of their lives, she said. As well as giving children the tools to cope with bullying on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat, the programme will also tackle online grooming and other dangers. It will receive 1 million pounds ($1.33 million) of funding from Facebook. “As industry leaders we take this very, very seriously,” Davis said. “People won’t utilize our platform if they don’t feel safe to do so.” Digital ambassadors at Wath Comprehensive School in Rotherham, northern England, said they had already seen positive benefits both for themselves and for other students. Fifteen-year-old Poppy, one of several schoolchildren at the launch of the programme, told Reuters she had been worried about some of the online dangers she’d heard about. “I am more positive in myself and in my abilities, and a lot more confident in using the internet,” she said, adding that she wanted to pass on her experience to others. Fellow student Patrick, also aged 15, said he had learned about topics ranging from fake news to online risks through the programme.   "

2017-11-01,-2,"Lawmakers were quick to say it appeared Facebook’s first priority was its business as opposed to national security. California Democrat Kamala Harris even brandished a 10-Q form. Several senators expressed disappointment that Zuckerberg, in addition to his missing counterparts at Twitter and Alphabet unit Google, decided to skip out on the hearings. It would be a glaring error, even by Silicon Valley’s happy standards, to brush aside the Russian problem on earnings day. Sure, the firm reported its profit jumped almost 80 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to nearly $5 billion. That topped analysts’ expectations and fueled a 2.6 percent rise in the stock. But Zuckerberg also said he was “dead serious” about fixing security and that doing so “will significantly impact our profitability going forward.” The shares shed the day’s gain, and a bit more, in after-hours trading. The company plans to hire more people to police dubious content, doubling the number of such staff to 20,000. As a result, expenses are expected to mushroom by as much as 60 percent next year. That’s a big number even for Facebook. But as the political heat increases, it has little choice but to respond."

2017-04-26,-7,"Facebook did not immediately  respond to a request for comment. The video is the latest example of Facebook being used to document violent crimes, a pattern that has led the company to re-evaluate some of its policies. Thailand police on Wednesday said they would consider how to quickly remove inappropriate online content after a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook. Last week, the company said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage after a posting of a fatal shooting in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours. The Canadian video showed someone kicking a woman in the face while a second person held back her arm from defending herself, according to Winnipeg Free Press, and was shared through Facebook, according to several media reports. Reuters has not seen the video. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sgt. Paul Manaigre said it may have been shared directly between people on Facebook, not posted for public viewing. RCMP are reviewing the video to determine whether it is linked to a weekend murder at Sagkeeng First Nation in Manitoba, Manaigre said. “To me, the video is shocking, that someone can stand there and watch it and not assist,” Manaigre said. Those who film crimes without aiding a victim could be charged in Canada with being an accessory, but the act of posting such videos is not illegal, he said. Police have charged two girls, ages 16 and 17, with the second-degree murder of a 19-year-old woman in Sagkeeng, an aboriginal community 100 kilometres (62 miles) northeast of Winnipeg. Sagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Angela Moon in New York; editing by Grant McCool)"
2017-05-31,-2,"Privacy remains a sensitive issue in Germany due to extensive surveillance by Communist East Germany’s Stasi secret police and by the Nazi era Gestapo. Memories of espionage were stirred anew by Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations of prying by the United States. In the Facebook case, the mother of a 15-year-old who was hit and killed by a subway train in Berlin in 2012 had sought access to her daughter’s account to search for clues as to whether the girl had committed suicide. Facebook had refused access to the account, which had been memorialized, meaning it was effectively locked and served as a message board for friends and family to share memories. A regional court in Berlin had ruled in favor of the mother in late 2015, saying that the daughter’s contract with Facebook passed to her parents according to German laws on inheritance. It had also said that the girl’s right to privacy was not protected because she was a minor and it was up to her parents to protect her rights. The appeals court said on Wednesday that the right to private telecommunications outweighed the right to inheritance, and that the parents’ obligation to protect their daughter’s rights expired with her death.

2017-09-27,-6,"“These actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election – but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people’s News Feeds,” the Facebook executive said in a statement. News feed is the central feature in user profiles whereby they can see updates from people they follow. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union secured victory in Sunday’s balloting with fewer votes than expected, forcing her to enter complicated coalition talks with various parties to form a new government. The company said it made a stronger push to remove fake accounts when it observed suspicious activity following widely reported foreign interference in the French and U.S. presidential elections over the past year. Besides seeking to encourage civic participation and voter education efforts, it also worked closely with authorities, including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), to monitor security threats during the campaign.  “Studies concluded that the level of false news was low,” concluded Allan, a former British member of parliament who, in addition to his work for Facebook, has been a member of the House of Lords since 2010.

It said it would also delete bogus profiles and stop promoting posts that show signs of being implausible. “We have developed new ways to identify and remove fake accounts that might be spreading false news so that we get to the root of the problem,” said Simon Milner, Facebook’s director of policy for the UK. The effort builds on the company’s recently expanded campaigns to identify fake news and crack down on automated profile pages that post commercial or political spam.  With the headline “Tips for spotting false news”, the adverts in Britain listed 10 ways to identify whether a story was genuine or not, including looking closely at a URL, investigating the source, looking for unusual formatting and considering the authenticity of the photo. Facebook said it had taken action against tens of thousands of fake accounts in Britain after identifying patterns of activity such as whether the same content is being repeatedly posted.  “With these changes, we expect we will also reduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts,” Facebook said.  Social media sites including Twitter and YouTube are also facing pressure in Europe where governments are threatening new laws and fines unless the companies move more quickly to remove extremist content.  Facebook has hired more staff to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts. "
2017-09-26,-10,"Posts for the period between Aug. 1 and Aug. 29 appear to have been “hidden” on the Facebook page of the office of the commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, which has covered the military’s actions, including those in western Myanmar, in detailed dispatches. The posts, which can still be found using specific date or keyword searches, included detailed accounts of the operation launched by the army following attacks on security forces on Aug. 25. It is unclear why, or when exactly, the posts disappeared. They were not visible on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday from several locations across Asia. “We don’t hide anything, it might be some kind of error,” said Ministry of Defense spokesman General Aung Ye Win. Zaw Htay, the spokesman for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, referred questions to Aung Ye Win. A spokesman for the military-run home affairs ministry, Police Colonel Myo Thu Soe, said he “had no idea” about the issue. A Facebook spokesperson said it was at the discretion of page administrators to hide posts if they wished. Around 480,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since the military counter-offensive began. The United Nations has described the campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has rejected that accusation, saying it is waging a legitimate fight against terrorists. A U.N.-mandated fact-finding mission is looking into “alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces and abuses in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine State”. The probe includes the violence that followed the Aug. 25 attacks. It was established after a similar, smaller military operation late last year. Like other news organizations, Reuters had used the detailed, timely postings in much of its early coverage of the August crisis. The August posts can still be seen if searched for with a specific date or a keyword, suggesting they have not been deleted but removed from the page’s timeline using Facebook’s “hide” function. “Keep in mind that if a post you’ve hidden was shared, it may still be visible to the audience it was shared with in other places on Facebook,” says Facebook about the function on its website. The feature can be undone by the account holder to restore the posts. The hidden August posts include very detailed accounts of clashes with militants, often accompanied by pictures. The military first posted on the attacks on Aug. 25, attaching a map showing police posts and military base that had been attacked.  The timeline updates resume on the military page after Aug. 31, with more than 360 posts in September, mostly about operations in Rakhine. Myawady, a media group which covers the military and publishes daily newspapers, has kept the August issues available online. "

2017-07-12,-3,"While Zuckerberg, 33, is a vocal supporter of renewable energy development, he said the visit gave him an opportunity to meet with those who rely on oil and natural gas production for their livelihood and oppose tighter regulation of the energy industry. “Many people I talked to here acknowledged (climate change), but also feel a sense of pride that their work contributes to serving real needs we all have every day - keeping our homes warm, getting to work, feeding us and more,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post early Wednesday morning. The Facebook co-founder flew his private jet into Williston, the de facto capital of the state’s oil industry, and toured a nearby drilling rig operated by Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) and an oil well owned by Statoil ASA (STL.OL). Zuckerberg spent more than two hours with roughnecks on the drilling rig, asking about technology developments that have helped the U.S. shale industry in the past two years cut in half the time needed to drill a new oil well. Representatives for Nabors and Statoil were not immediately available to comment. In a picture accompanying the Facebook post, Zuckerberg can be seen wearing the oilfield uniform of fire-resistant coveralls and a hard hat. He is not wearing safety glasses or gloves but holds them in his left hand, a violation of rig safety rules.     “Zuckerberg was extremely intrigued by all the technological developments in the oilfields,” said Ron Ness, head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, the industry trade group that arranged the tour with Facebook. Zuckerberg later held a community meeting to discuss education and housing. Politicians were not allowed to attend. The months-long delay of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which transports the state’s Bakken crude oil, was also a main topic.     “A number of people told me they had felt their livelihood was blocked by the government, but when (President Donald) Trump approved the pipeline, they felt a sense of hope again,” Zuckerberg said.

2017-05-04,-2,"Rubin added that Oculus is “still absolutely committed to growing the VR film and creative content ecosystem.”  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said he believed the medium that offers a 360-degree panoramic view using headsets “will become a part of daily life for billions of people.”  Oculus tapped talent from both Oscar-winning animation company Pixar and the video gaming world to head up Story Studio, which it launched in January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival.  Facebook’s VR ambitions have been threatened somewhat by a lawsuit from video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc accusing Facebook and Oculus of infringing ZeniMax’s copyrighted software code.  A jury found in ZeniMax’s favor in February, awarding it $500 million. Oculus has asked for a new trial.  Vive, a unit of HTC Corp, and Sony Corp are also racing to bring virtual reality products to a mass audience.  Oculus debuted its first short film called “Lost” at Sundance two years ago, a story of an animated mechanical creature in a forest.  Last year, Story Studio won an Emmy for original interactive program for its short VR film “Henry,” and at Sundance this year, it premiered “Dear Angelica,” an illustrated film of a mother and daughter.   But internally, Oculus has undergone some changes in its management in the past year.  Brendan Iribe stepped down as CEO in December, saying he was going to head up the PC division of the VR company. In March, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, who created the prototype Oculus headset, parted ways with Facebook. "
2017-04-25,-12,"“This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim,” a Singapore-based Facebook spokesman said in an email to Reuters. “There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.”  Murders, suicides and sexual assault have plagued Facebook despite making up a small percentage of videos. On Tuesday a Swedish court jailed three men for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook. Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of a man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down. The harrowing footage from Thailand showed Wuttisan Wongtalay tying a rope to his daughter Natalie’s neck before dropping the child, dressed in a bright pink dress, from the rooftop of a deserted building in the seaside town of Phuket. Wuttisan’s suicide was not broadcast but his lifeless body was found beside his daughter, said Jullaus Suvannin, the police officer in charge of the case. “He was having paranoia about his wife leaving him and not loving him,” Jullaus told Reuters. Wuttisan’s wife, Jiranuch Triratana, told Reuters she had lived with him for over a year. At first the relationship had gone well, she said, but then he grew violent and sometimes hit her 5-year-old son from a previous husband. She feared that something was wrong on Tuesday when she found he had left home with Natalie, whose nickname was Beta. She set out to look for them. “I was afraid he would hurt our daughter even though he loved her,” she told Reuters by phone from the funeral. “We contacted Facebook today and Facebook removed the videos,” ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters, adding that the government would take no action against the company.  After the company faced a backlash for showing the video of the Cleveland killing, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would do all it could to prevent such content in the future.  Thai netizens voiced outrage about the clips of the child’s killing, which were uploaded on Monday, the first at 4.50 p.m. (0950 GMT) and the second at 4.57 p.m. (0957 GMT). “This is the most evil clip I’ve seen in my life,” said one user, Avada Teeraponkoon. “I couldn’t stand it for more than one second.”  The killing was the first in Thailand known to be broadcast on the social networking site, said deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen.  “It could be influenced by behavior from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,” Kissana told Reuters.  The first video had drawn 112,000 views by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, while the second video showed 258,000 views. The company relies largely on reports from its 1.9 billion users to find objectionable material. Flagged items are forwarded to thousands of Facebook workers who judge whether they should be taken down. Facebook has said it is working on software to automatically flag videos that are objectionable. But a person who has worked on the issues at Facebook said that major Silicon Valley companies were still working on the much easier problem of blocking previously identified child pornography videos. Identifying violence in a newly uploaded video would be very difficult, this person said.  Advertisers have not identified the violent videos as a major concern. Facebook is still a safe place for companies to build brands, said Barry Lowenthal, president of the Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer. “It’s pretty amazing that they were able to figure it out and get it down in such a short period of time with 2 billion users,” he said.

2017-06-27,0,"Social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc have beefed up their focus on signing live-streaming sports deals as young audience increasingly rely on the internet to watch sports ditching the traditional cable services. Fox Sports will stream UEFA Champions League matches in the United States on its Facebook pages, starting in September, according to the deal. The partnership includes two live matches per day in the group stage, four round of 16 matches and four quarterfinal matches, Fox said. As an attempt to further push into live video, Facebook also struck a deal, last month, with Major League Baseball to show 20 of the league’s games live this season. Twitter also chalked out a live streaming deal with the Canadian Football League (CFL) on Tuesday to stream a 30-minute live show featuring football news, player interviews and stories about the league, the CFL said. The microblogging website had signed a multi-year deal, last month, with the U.S. National Football League to live-stream pre-game coverage as well as a 30-minute show. "
2017-05-03,-40,"The move is an acknowledgement by Facebook that it needs more than its recent focus on automated software to identify and remove such material. Artificial intelligence techniques would take “a period of years ... to really reach the quality level that we want,”  Zuckerberg told investors after the company’s earnings late on Wednesday. “Given the importance of this, how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we double down on this and make sure that we provide as safe of an experience for the community as we can,” he said.  The problem has become more pressing since the introduction last year of Facebook Live, a service that allows any of Facebook’s 1.9 billion monthly users to broadcast video, which has been marred by some violent scenes.  Some violence on Facebook is inevitable given its size, researchers say, but the company has been attacked for its slow response.  UK lawmakers this week accused social media companies including Facebook of doing a “shameful” job removing child abuse and other potentially illegal material. In Germany, the company has been under pressure to be quicker and more accurate in removing illegal hate speech and to clamp down on so-called fake news.  German lawmakers have threatened fines if the company cannot remove at least 70 percent of offending posts within 24 hours. So far, Facebook has avoided political fallout from U.S. lawmakers or any significant loss of the advertisers it depends on for revenue. Some in the ad industry have defended Facebook, citing the difficulty of policing material from its many users. Police agencies have said Facebook works well with them.  Facebook shares fell slightly on Wednesday, and edged lower still after the bell, following its quarterly earnings. Last week, a father in Thailand broadcast himself killing his daughter on Facebook Live, police said. After more than a day, and 370,000 views, Facebook removed the video. A video of a man shooting and killing another in Cleveland last month also shocked viewers. Zuckerberg said the company would do better: “We’re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner - whether that’s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.” The world’s largest social network has been turning to artificial intelligence to try to automate the process of finding pornography, violence and other potentially offensive material. In March, the company said it planned to use such technology to help spot users with suicidal tendencies and get them assistance. However, Facebook still relies largely on its users to report problematic material. It receives millions of reports from users each week, and like other large Silicon Valley companies, it relies on thousands of human monitors to review the reports.  “Despite industry claims to the contrary, I don’t know of any computational mechanism that can adequately, accurately, 100 percent do this work in lieu of humans. We’re just not there yet technologically,” said Sarah Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA who looks at content monitoring. The workers who monitor material generally work on contract in places such as India and the Philippines, and they face difficult working conditions because of the hours they spend making quick decisions while sifting through traumatic material, Roberts said in an interview. In December, two people who monitored graphic material for Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) services such as Skype sued the company, saying it had failed to warn them about the risks to their mental health. They are seeking compensation for medical costs, wages lost from disability and other damages.  Microsoft has disputed their claims. The company said in a statement that it takes seriously the responsibility to remove and report imagery of child sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as the health and resilience of employees.  Mental health assistance plans sometimes fall by the wayside for such workers, and there was a risk that would happen for Facebook if it tries to find 3,000 new workers quickly, Roberts said. “To do it at this scale and this magnitude, I question that,” she said.  When Facebook launched its live service in April 2016, Zuckerberg spoke about it as a place for “raw and visceral” communication.  “Because it’s live, there is no way it can be curated,” Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed News in an interview then. “And because of that it frees people up to be themselves. It’s live; it can’t possibly be perfectly planned out ahead of time.” Since then, at least 50 criminal or violent incidents have been broadcast over Facebook Live, including assault, murder and suicide, The Wall Street Journal reported in March. In January, four African-Americans in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled man on Facebook Live while making anti-white racial taunts. They have pleaded not guilty.  A man in Cleveland, Ohio, last month was accused of shooting another man on a sidewalk and then uploading a video of the murder to Facebook, where it remained for about two hours. The man later fatally shot himself.  Zuckerberg said the company would keep working with community groups and law enforcement, and that there have been instances when intervention has helped. “Just last week, we got a report that someone on Live was considering suicide,” he wrote in his post. “We immediately reached out to law enforcement, and they were able to prevent him from hurting himself. In other cases, we weren’t so fortunate.” "
2017-09-08,-4,"Facebook, which generates revenues from advertising based on data from its users’ social connections, opinions and activities, has said it complies with the law.  “I think we will present first results of this case before the end of this year,” Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt told a conference organized by the International Bar Association. Companies can be fined up to 10 percent of their annual turnover by the German competition regulator if found guilty of abusing a dominant market position, though it has never imposed the maximum penalty. "
2017-11-08,-2,"“In the near future Roskomnadzor will plan a series of supervisory activities aimed at analyzing the activities of the administration of Facebook in terms of the processing of Russian users’ personal information, the terms of services for users, and the content of existing legislation,” it said in a statement on Wednesday carried by the Interfax news agency.  Russian authorities say the law, introduced in 2014, is aimed at protecting Russians’ personal data.  Critics, however, see its use as an attack on social media in a country that has tightened its control over the Internet in recent years.   Last year Roskomnadzor blocked access to LinkedIn to comply with a court ruling that found the networking service guilty of violating the same data storage law.  LinkedIn Corp. has yet to come to an agreement with Russian authorities to restore public access to the service. "
2017-10-13,-17,"Axios asked Sandberg what the world’s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia’s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.  The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.  Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.  She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of  revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election. Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumors around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review. Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said. Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was “free from abuse” during any election in any country. “We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg said.  She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users. Sandberg said it was important to protect “free expression” on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site. She criticized Twitter’s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. “In that ad, there are a lot of things that people don’t like, that I don’t like. ... But the question is, ‘Should divisive political or issue ads run?’ Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,” she said. Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work toward making ad purchases more transparent, and she said  Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue. Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1. "
2017-06-23,-2,"The new initiative will train non-governmental organizations to help them monitor and respond to extremist content and create a dedicated support desk so they can communicate directly with Facebook, the company said.  “There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook,” said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. “We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform.”  The British government has stepped up attacks on Silicon Valley internet companies for not acting quickly enough to take down extremist online propaganda and fostering “safe places” where extremists can breed following a string of attacks in recent months in London and Manchester. Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc have responded by saying they have made heavy investments and employed thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content over the past two years. Security analysts say the efforts have dramatically reduced the use of these platforms for jihadist recruitment efforts, although more work needs to be done. Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to enlist British public opinion to force the U.S. internet players to work more closely with the government rather than proposing new legislation or policies to assert greater control over the web. Earlier this week, May urged fellow European Union leaders at a meeting in Brussels to join her in putting pressure on tech companies to ‘rid terrorist material from the internet in all our languages’.  She called for the internet companies to shift from reactively removing content when they are notified of it, toward greater use of automatic detection and removal tools - and ultimately preventing it from appearing on their platforms in the first place. "
2017-11-22,0,"Africa’s rapid population growth, falling data costs and heavy adoption of mobile phones rather than PCs is attracting technology companies looking to attract more users.   Facebook did not provide details of the period over which its planned training would take place in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country with 180 million inhabitants.   “We understand the important role Facebook plays here in Nigeria with developers and start-ups and are invested in helping these communities,” Emeka Afigbo, its regional head of platform partnership, said in a statement on Wednesday. Facebook said the training - aimed at software developers, entrepreneurs and students - would be offered in cities including the capital, Abuja, Port Harcourt in the south, Calabar in the southeast and Kaduna in the north.  Last year Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited technology companies in Lagos and his charitable foundation provided $24 million to Andela, which trains developers.  Google’s chief executive in a July visit to Lagos said the company aimed to train 10 million people across the continent in online skills over the next five years. He also said it hoped to train 100,000 software developers in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.  Although Africa may not offer as much opportunity to add consumers as China or India, because large wealth gaps mean that many people in places like Nigeria have little disposable income, Facebook said more than 22 million people already use its social media website every month in Nigeria.   Widespread poverty means mobile adoption tends to favor basic phone models. That, combined with poor telecommunications infrastructure, can mean slow internet speeds and less internet surfing, which tech firms rely on to make money.  "
2017-03-13,-5,"In response to the ACLU report, the companies shut off the data access of Geofeedia, a Chicago-based data vendor that said it works with organizations to “leverage social media,” but Facebook policy had not explicitly barred such use of data in the future.  “Our goal is to make our policy explicit,” Rob Sherman, Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, said in a post on the social network on Monday. He was not immediately available for an interview.  The change would help build “a community where people can feel safe making their voices heard,” Sherman said. Racially charged protests broke out in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson in the aftermath of the August 2014 shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In a 2015 email message, a Geofeedia employee touted its “great success” covering the protests, according to the ACLU report based on government records. Representatives of Geofeedia could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. The company has worked with more than 500 law enforcement agencies, the ACLU said.  Geofeedia Chief Executive Officer Phil Harris said in October that the company was committed to privacy and would work to build on civil rights protections. Major social media platforms including Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube (GOOGL.O) have taken action or implemented policies similar to Facebook‘s, said Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California. Ozer praised the companies’ action but said they should have stopped such use of data earlier. “It shouldn’t take a public records request from the ACLU for these companies to know what their developers are doing,” she said. It was also unclear how the companies would enforce their policies, said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a nonprofit that opposes government use of social media for surveillance. Inside corporations, “is the will there, without constant activist pressure, to enforce these rules?” Cyril said.  "
2017-06-26,0,"The social networking giant has indicated that it was willing to commit to production budgets as high as $3 million per episode, in meetings with Hollywood talent agencies, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. on.wsj.com/2scl2NV Facebook is hoping to target audiences from ages 13 to 34, with a focus on the 17 to 30 range. The company has already lined up “Strangers”, a relationship drama, and a game show, “Last State Standing”, the report said. Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment. The company is expected to release episodes in a traditional manner, instead of dropping an entire season in one go like Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc, WSJ reported. The company is also willing to share its viewership data with Hollywood, the report said. Apple Inc hired co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, earlier this month, to lead its video-programming efforts. Apple began its long-awaited move into original television series last week, with a reality show called “Planet of the Apps”, an unscripted show about developers trying to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The company’s future programming plans include an adaptation of comedian James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” segment from his CBS Corp show that will begin airing in August.

2017-07-10,-9,"Oculus is cutting the combined price of its Rift headset and Touch controllers to $399 for six weeks beginning on Monday, said Jason Rubin, Oculus vice president for content. That matches the price of another virtual reality set, PlayStation VR, made by Sony Corp. Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price. Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would “become a part of daily life for billions of people.” That has not happened, although it is unclear if that is because of high prices, something inherent in the technology or some other reason. Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy. The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said: “We’re now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.” Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March. In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers. Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement. Oculus has asked for a new trial."
2017-04-27,-19,"These initiatives go much further than posting fake news stories to include amplification - essentially widening the circulation of posts through a variety of means - carried out by government employees or paid professionals, often using fake accounts. Reuters reviewed an advance copy of the 13-page report, which was written by two veteran security analysts who joined Facebook from cyber security firms FireEye Inc and Dell SecureWorks, along with Facebook’s chief security officer. (here) Facebook said its security team would now fight information operations, which it regards as a more complex problem than traditional hackers and scammers, by suspending or deleting false accounts after identifying them with a combination of machine learning and intelligence agency-level analysis. The new efforts build on the company’s recently expanded campaigns to identify fake news and crack down on automated profile pages that post commercial or political spam. Facebook suspended 30,000 accounts in France ahead of last Sunday’s first-round presidential election. In addressing the U.S. presidential election as a “case study,” the Facebook team said fake Facebook personas had spread stolen emails and other documents as part of a coordinated effort, which U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed to Russia. Other false personas pushed stories that expanded on that material. “From there, organic proliferation of the messaging and data through authentic peer groups and networks was inevitable,” Facebook said. It said its data “does not contradict” the U.S. director of national intelligence’s conclusion that Russia was behind efforts to interfere with the U.S. election. The report does not name any other countries. ‘FALSE AMPLIFICATION’  Facebook has faced pressure to clamp down on fake news, and has begun warning about suspected hoax stories. In its latest report, Facebook focused on how it will fight “false amplification” and targeted data collection, carried out through methods such as imposter accounts and password-collection schemes.   Facebook employees said the information operations it had seen included techniques such as carefully crafted friend requests sent under the appropriated names of real people. If those requests are accepted, the false friends can glean more information about the target. That information in turn can be used to send convincing web links leading to malicious software or to map the social networks of the targets for further spying. Facebook said it would go after amplifier accounts based on behavioral analysis that shows signs of inauthenticity, such as sudden bursts of activity or repeated posting of the same material, without regard to the politics of the content. Facebook said that other amplification techniques it had discovered include coordinated “likes” to boost the prominence of key postings, the creation of groups that camouflage propaganda by including legitimate items, and the spread of inflammatory and racist material. Most of the false amplification is driven by people with local language skills and a basic knowledge of the relevant political situation, the study said. Though the goals may often be to promote one cause or candidate or to denigrate another, another objective appears to be sowing distrust and confusion in general, the authors wrote. In some cases, they said, the same fake accounts engaged with both sides of an issue “with the apparent intent of increasing tensions between supporters.” Facebook’s new crackdown reflects a striking change in perspective from November, when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the argument that fake stories on Facebook could have influenced the U.S. presidential election “in any way” as “a pretty crazy idea.” "
2017-04-27,-7,"Facebook’s commitment came during a meeting between its Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert and Vietnamese information and communication minister Truong Minh Tuan in Hanoi on Wednesday, a statement on the government’s website said. “Facebook will set up a separate channel to directly coordinate with Vietnam’s communication and information ministry to prioritize requests from the ministry and other competent authorities in the country,” the statement said. The firm will also remove fake accounts and fake content about senior government officials, it said. A Facebook representative said the company had a clear and consistent process for governments to report illegal content. “We review all these requests against our terms of service and applicable law. We are transparent about the requests we receive from government and content we restrict pursuant with local law in our Global Government Requests Report,” the representative said in an emailed statement. The report shows no content restricted at the request of Vietnam’s government between July 2015 and June 2016, the latest period for which Facebook has published data. Vietnam’s government tolerates little dissent and human rights groups and western countries have criticized its arrest of anti-government bloggers. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to local agency Isobar Vietnam. Facebook has faced an unrelated challenge this week in nearby Thailand, where a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in a live video on Facebook that stayed on the platform for 24 hours before being removed.

2017-10-19,-7,"Executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also were expected to appear at a public hearing before the House intelligence committee, but have not yet said who will represent them. General counsel Colin Stretch will be the Facebook representative to take testify, company spokesman Andy Stone said. The company’s high-profile Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg will not appear. Some U.S. lawmakers, increasingly alarmed over evidence that hackers used the internet to spread fake news and otherwise influence last year’s election, have been pushing for more information about social networks. In the U.S. Senate, Republican John McCain and Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner planned to introduce legislation on Thursday that would impose new disclosure requirements on political ads that run on Facebook and other websites. The Senate and House intelligence committees are two of the main congressional panels probing allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the U.S. election to boost Republican President Donald Trump’s chances of winning, and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia. Moscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has repeatedly dismissed any accusations of collusion. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"
2017-11-14,-7,"“A consumer who is entitled to sue his foreign contact partner in his own place of domicile, cannot invoke, at the same time as his own claims, claims on the same subject assigned by other consumers,” the EU top court’s Advocate General Michal Bobek said. The advocate general, whose opinions are not binding but usually followed by the court, said allowing a class action suit in this case would lead consumers to choose the place of the most favorable court. Privacy activist Schrems, who had argued that individual lawsuits on user privacy would be “impossible” due to the financial burden on users, said a ruling in line with the advocate general’s opinion would still allow him to set a precedent. “In the advocate general’s view, I can at least bring a ‘model case’ at my home jurisdiction in Vienna, which may enable us to debate the illegal practices of Facebook in an open court for the first time,” Schrems said in a statement. Facebook said the advocate general’s opinion supported the decision of two courts that Schrem’s claims could not proceed as a class action. While common in the United States, class action suits are rarely recognized in Europe. “It is not for the Court to create such collective redress in consumer matters, but eventually for the Union legislator,” the Advocate General said.

2017-03-01,0,"Artificial intelligence will be used to help spot users with suicidal tendencies, the company said in a blogpost on Wednesday. (bit.ly/2lxYeFZ) In January, a 14-year-old foster child in Florida broadcast her suicide reportedly on Facebook Live, according to the New York Post.  Facebook is already using artificial intelligence to monitor offensive material in live video streams. The company said on Wednesday that the updated tools would give an option to users watching a live video to reach out to the person directly and report the video to Facebook. Facebook Inc (FB.O) will also provide resources, which include reaching out to a friend and contacting a help line, to the user reporting the live video. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for 15-29 year olds. Suicide rates jumped 24 percent in the United States between 1999 and 2014 after a period of nearly consistent decline, according to a National Center for Health Statistics study. "
2017-07-26,-11,"Facebook said it hoped additional participants would turn it into a freestanding information-sharing center controlled by its members. Facebook, with two billion monthly users, bills itself as a vehicle for political debate and education, but was also used as a major platform to spread fake news and propaganda during the U.S. election campaign in 2016.   Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced the company’s backing at the opening of the Black Hat information security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The event, named after the term for malicious hackers, is aimed mainly at corporate and government security professionals. Stamos declined to say how much money the Facebook would spend. “Right now we are the founding sponsor, but we are in discussions with other tech organizations,” Stamos said in an interview before the speech. “The goal for our money specifically is to help build a standalone ISAO (Information Sharing and Analysis Organization) that pulls in all the different groups that have some kind of vulnerability.” “Most campaigns don’t have the tools right now to defend themselves from cyber attacks,” Clinton campaign chair Robby Mook said in an email. “Our initiative aims to fill that void and to help both Democratic and Republican campaigns defend themselves with greater information-sharing and security tools.” Stamos also urged Black Hat attendees, many of whom are leery of government intrusion, to be more open-minded about helping law enforcement track criminals and terrorists. Unthinking rejection of official requests could lead to legislation forcing companies to break their own encryption, Stamos warned. Stamos said he would continue to argue against such steps. “We’re not going to be effective unless we demonstrate that we have the same goals,” he said. “I want to present our position that strong cryptography is a critical part of building a safe, trustworthy future.” "
2017-04-26,-10,"The video is the latest example of Facebook being used to document violent crimes, a pattern that has led the company to re-evaluate some of its policies. “This was a horrific tragedy,“ Facebook said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ”We have not been able to locate the video on Facebook, and are working with law enforcement as they investigate.” Thailand police said on Wednesday they would consider how to quickly remove inappropriate online content after a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook. Last week, the company said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage after a posting of a fatal shooting in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours. The Canadian video showed someone kicking a woman in the face while a second person held back her arm from defending herself, according to Winnipeg Free Press, and was shared through Facebook. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Sgt. Paul Manaigre said police are reviewing the video to determine whether it is linked to a murder at Sagkeeng First Nation in Manitoba last weekend. It may have been shared directly between people on Facebook, but not posted for public viewing, he said. Reuters has not seen the video. Police have charged two girls, ages 16 and 17, with the second-degree murder of a 19-year-old woman in Sagkeeng. Sagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson could not be reached for comment. Claude Guimond, school principal at Sagkeeng, said two videos, each lasting less than one minute, of the beating, circulated widely through Facebook in Sagkeeng, an aboriginal community 100 kilometres (62 miles) northeast of Winnipeg. “It was brutally graphic,” he said, declining to describe the content. Guimond said that he identified in the video both of the accused, and the victim, all of whom attended his school. Those who film crimes without aiding a victim could be charged in Canada with being an accessory, but the act of posting such videos is not illegal, the RCMP’s Manaigre said.  “To me, the video is shocking, that someone can stand there and watch it and not assist,” he said.

2017-06-26,0,"Facebook is hoping to target audiences from ages 13 to 34, with a focus on the 17 to 30 range. The company has already lined up “Strangers”, a relationship drama, and a game show, “Last State Standing”, the report said. “We’re focused on episodic shows and helping all our partners understand what works across different verticals and topics,” said Nick Grudin, Facebook’s vice president for media partnerships. The company is also willing to share its viewership data with Hollywood, the report said.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) hired co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, earlier this month, to lead its video-programming efforts. Apple began its long-awaited move into original television series last week, with a reality show called “Planet of the Apps”, an unscripted show about developers trying to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The company’s future programing plans include an adaptation of comedian James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” segment from his CBS Corp (CBS.N) show that will begin airing in August. "
2017-09-05,-1,"“We’re building and testing new tools via a free WhatsApp Business app for small companies and an enterprise solution for bigger companies operating at a large scale with a global base of customers, like airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks,” according to the blog post. WhatsApp has already started a pilot program that would feature a green badge next to a business contact, indicating that the business was verified by the messaging service. ""We do intend on charging businesses in the future,"" Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema told the Journal in an interview. (on.wsj.com/2eBw3UA) Reuters had reported in March that a potential revenue source for WhatsApp was to charge businesses that want to contact customers, citing company documents. (reut.rs/2w33Axm) Started in 2009, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for an eye-popping $22 billion in 2014. While WhatsApp had little revenue at the time of the deal, the purchase price was slightly more than the market value of Sony Corp. Facebook has not focused on WhatsApp so far. The social network had started showing ads inside its Messenger app in July to further monetize the chat service. Idema declined to describe the paid features or say when they would make their debut, according to the report. “We don’t have the details of monetization figured out,” he told the Journal. "
2017-04-25,-12,"“This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim,” a Singapore-based Facebook spokesman said in an email to Reuters. “There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.”  Murders, suicides and sexual assault have plagued Facebook despite making up a small percentage of videos. On Tuesday a Swedish court jailed three men for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook. Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of a man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down. The harrowing footage from Thailand showed Wuttisan Wongtalay tying a rope to his daughter Natalie’s neck before dropping the child, dressed in a bright pink dress, from the rooftop of a deserted building in the seaside town of Phuket. Wuttisan’s suicide was not broadcast but his lifeless body was found beside his daughter, said Jullaus Suvannin, the police officer in charge of the case. “He was having paranoia about his wife leaving him and not loving him,” Jullaus told Reuters. Wuttisan’s wife, Jiranuch Triratana, told Reuters she had lived with him for over a year. At first the relationship had gone well, she said, but then he grew violent and sometimes hit her 5-year-old son from a previous husband. She feared that something was wrong on Tuesday when she found he had left home with Natalie, whose nickname was Beta. She set out to look for them. “I was afraid he would hurt our daughter even though he loved her,” she told Reuters by phone from the funeral. “We contacted Facebook today and Facebook removed the videos,” ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters, adding that the government would take no action against the company.  After the company faced a backlash for showing the video of the Cleveland killing, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would do all it could to prevent such content in the future.  Thai netizens voiced outrage about the clips of the child’s killing, which were uploaded on Monday, the first at 4.50 p.m. (0950 GMT) and the second at 4.57 p.m. (0957 GMT). “This is the most evil clip I’ve seen in my life,” said one user, Avada Teeraponkoon. “I couldn’t stand it for more than one second.”  The killing was the first in Thailand known to be broadcast on the social networking site, said deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen.  “It could be influenced by behavior from abroad, most recently in Cleveland,” Kissana told Reuters.  The first video had drawn 112,000 views by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, while the second video showed 258,000 views. The company relies largely on reports from its 1.9 billion users to find objectionable material. Flagged items are forwarded to thousands of Facebook workers who judge whether they should be taken down. Facebook has said it is working on software to automatically flag videos that are objectionable. But a person who has worked on the issues at Facebook said that major Silicon Valley companies were still working on the much easier problem of blocking previously identified child pornography videos. Identifying violence in a newly uploaded video would be very difficult, this person said.  Advertisers have not identified the violent videos as a major concern. Facebook is still a safe place for companies to build brands, said Barry Lowenthal, president of the Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer. “It’s pretty amazing that they were able to figure it out and get it down in such a short period of time with 2 billion users,” he said.

2017-05-03,0,"Mobile ad revenue accounted for 85 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue of $7.86 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with 82 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $7.68 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. The social media giant is expected to generate $31.94 billion in mobile ad revenue globally in 2017, a 42.1 percent jump from a year earlier, according to research firm eMarketer. Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $1.73 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $8.03 billion from $5.38 billion. Facebook is the last of the top five U.S. tech companies to report quarterly earnings. "
2017-08-15,-4,"“This is an expected development, it will not change our strategy,” Chief Financial Officer Trond Berger told Reuters. Schibsted holds market-leading positions in local classified advertising websites across Europe including Norway’s Finn and France’s Leboncoin, and also has fast-growing operations in Asia, Africa and the Americas. “Facebook’s Marketplace has shown little effect on (competitors’) growth in the markets it has launched in the past,” Berger said. Schibsted’s biggest classified revenue streams come from services such as job adverts, car sales and real estate sales, and less from person-to-person trade in smaller items. “The generalist market means less to us income-wise, so we are not particularly concerned about our revenue flows,” the CFO said. He also said he did not expect an increase in costs to keep up with competition from the social network giant. Schibsted shares recovered some of their early losses and were down 5 percent at 1316 GMT. Analysts highlighted the rise in competition and worries over costs. “Overall, increased competition is negative, but the generalist market is only a minor part of Schibsted’s revenues,” Danske Bank Markets analyst Martin Stenshall said. “I think investors worry that Schibsted’s response could be to invest even more into its online classifieds to defend its position,” he added. Anders Skoe, chief executive of Schibsted’s Norwegian service Finn said Facebook’s entry was more likely to expand overall demand than to cannibalise existing players. About four percent of Finn’s revenues comes from the so-called the generalist market, Skoe said. Facebook’s Marketplace is being introduced this week in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Launched 10 months ago, Marketplace charges no fees to buyers or sellers and aims to make it easy for users to trade mostly second-hand goods. "
2017-09-29,-36,"Seizure is the second step. The government sifts through the disclosed data, determines what’s covered by the search warrant, and seizes that evidence. The American Civil Liberties Union, noting that process is codified in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and parallel state rules, calls it “disclose-then-seize.”  The ACLU is worried about what happens to the information that’s disclosed but not seized. In a new filing in the government’s investigation of looting during President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the ACLU has asked Chief Judge Robert Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to quash a subpoena demanding that Facebook turn over 90 days of records on accounts belonging to three political activists.  The ACLU brief contends that the Facebook warrants would give the government unjustified access not only to irrelevant private information about the activists, such as their medical history and conversations with romantic partners, but also information protected by the First Amendment.  “Government agents would discover a detailed portrait of individuals’ political activities and associations, including their political views and commentary; the pictures and names of individuals who participated in or organized political demonstrations, rallies, dance parties, teach-ins, and other political events; messages reflecting a user’s involvement or affiliation with specific political organizations or groups; and political or organizational strategies for political activism – all regarding events unconnected to January 20,” the ACLU brief said.  The ACLU argues that without safeguards to limit what Facebook discloses or, in the alternative, what prosecutors are permitted to see, the search warrants are “manifestly overbroad,” in violation of the Fourth Amendment. It doesn’t matter, according to the ACLU, that prosecutors will only “seize” information they deem relevant to the investigation. The problem lies in the initial disclosure to the government of private and protected information.  “Permitting government officials to comb through 90 days’ worth of personal messages concerning political activity and associations — some of which are aimed at protesting the policies of the very administration on whose behalf the government officials would be acting in searching Intervenors’ records — is an unjustified invasion of privacy hearkening back to the ‘general warrants’ that the Fourth Amendment was enacted specifically to prohibit,” the brief said.  As you can imagine, this is not the first time that targets of a search warrant for electronic data have advanced the ACLU’s argument. The brief cites a string of cases in which judges have balked at subpoenas calling for broad disclosure of account information. In 2013, for example, U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola of Washington, D.C., held that a warrant for information from the Facebook account of a suspect in a shooting at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was overly broad because it demanded disclosures about websites the suspect might have joined. That same year, a federal magistrate in Kansas denied search warrant applications that would have required Google, GoDaddy, Verizon, Yahoo and Skype to disclose account records, including emails and instant messages, of a robbery suspect.   The Kansas judge, David Waxse, said the warrants were too broad under the Fourth Amendment. “Even if the court were to allow a warrant with a broad authorization for the content of all email communications without a nexus to the specific crimes being investigated, the warrants would still not pass Constitutional muster,” he wrote. “They fail to set out any limits on the government’s review of the potentially large amount of electronic communications and information obtained from the electronic communications service providers.”  Judge Morin, who is overseeing the government’s investigation of violence at the inauguration, has himself set limits on prosecutors in this very case. You may recall the flap earlier this month over a search warrant served on the website hosting service DreamHost, demanding a raft of information about DreamHost client www.disruptj20.org, which acted last January as a clearinghouse for inauguration protests. (One of the three activists the ACLU represents in the Facebook warrant challenge runs disruptJ20’s Facebook account.)  After DreamHost protested the breadth of the warrant, which appeared to require disclosure of information on every visitor to disruptJ20’s website, Judge Morin issued a Sept. 15 order requiring the government to specify a plan to minimize prosecutors’ exposure to extraneous information. Though the judge did not specify the safeguards he wants the government to adopt, he emphasized the First Amendment rights of innocent website visitors.  In light of his own DreamHost decision, the ACLU said, Judge Morin should, at a minimum, set parameters in the Facebook account information subject to the search warrants or appoint a special master to review the data before it reaches prosecutors.  Those seem like reasonable protections to me, considering that without them, any of the 6,000 Facebook users who gave a thumbs-up to disruptJ20’s Facebook page will be exposed to prosecutors for the mere act of clicking a like button. Americans have a First Amendment right to associate with protest groups, in real life and on Facebook."
2017-04-28,-20,"On Monday, in an abandoned building in the Thai seaside resort of Phuket, 20-year-old Wuttisan Wongtalay turned on Facebook Live from his mobile phone. Then he picked up his 11-month-old daughter in her pink dress, tied a rope around her neck and hanged her. A second short video briefly shows her lifeless body. After that, he turned off the camera and killed himself. For the family of little Natalie Triratana, removing the videos was the last thing on their minds when they first popped up on Wuttisan’s Facebook feed at around 4.50 p.m. on Monday. Her mother’s cousin, Suksan Buachanit, said he called Thailand’s 191 police hotline to ask for help locating the building. By the time police and relatives found it, it was too late. “A local reporter told me to report it (to Facebook) but we were all occupied at the scene,” Suksan told Reuters in Phuket. It took more than a day - and 370,000 views - before Facebook removed those few minutes of video. Thailand’s digital ministry said even then it took five hours for the videos to be removed after the ministry contacted Facebook. A Facebook statement called the incident “appalling” and said there was “absolutely no place for content of this kind” on the network. It did not respond to Reuters questions as to why it took so long to remove the videos. In that incident, it took two hours to remove the video, bringing intense criticism on the social media giant and prompting it to promise “ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment”. [L4N1HZ3EO] It was unclear how many viewers alerted Facebook to the killing of the baby. Facebook did not respond to questions. But by the morning the baby’s murder had been reported in local media and was one of the most talked about stories in Thailand. Several local and international journalists told Reuters they had reported the videos to Facebook Tuesday morning and asked the company for comment. The head of Thailand’s police’s Technology Crime Suppression Division, Supachet Chokchai, said he was alerted to the baby murder videos by police in Phuket but he declined to say when that was. The division monitors online content ranging from anti-monarchy content to fraudulent websites. It also has a hotline for the public to call in tip-offs about offensive content. Nor would Supachet say when police then asked the digital ministry to get in touch with Facebook. The ministry said by the time police reported the videos on Tuesday afternoon it had already heard about them from an anonymous tip-off and had told Facebook. The ministry contacted Facebook through a “direct channel” at noon on Tuesday, according to Somsak Khaosuwan, the ministry’s deputy permanent secretary. He did not elaborate on what the direct channel was or say whom the ministry contacted at Facebook. It was only just after 5.00 p.m. - about five hours later and more than a full day after the videos were first streamed - that Facebook took them down. Police blamed the delay partly on the time difference between the United States, where Facebook is headquartered, and Thailand. They did not explain at exactly which stage the time difference had proved problematic, however. A spokesman for the police also said the force was tight on staffing. Thailand, along with other authoritarian governments in Asia, is more geared up to monitor politically sensitive content online. Censorship has been ramped up since a 2014 coup and hundreds of websites have been blocked or shut down for content deemed inappropriate or offensive.  Thailand is further tightening controls on internet users. This week, Thailand’s national telecoms regulator ordered all internet service providers to block web content deemed illegal by the courts within a week or face having their licenses revoked. Thailand is also working on a cyber security bill that would allow the state to conduct large-scale surveillance in the name of national security by wiretapping telephones and computers without the need for court approval.

2017-03-01,0,"Artificial intelligence will be used to help spot users with suicidal tendencies, the company said in a blogpost on Wednesday. (bit.ly/2lxYeFZ) In January, a 14-year-old foster child in Florida broadcast her suicide reportedly on Facebook Live, according to the New York Post.  Facebook is already using artificial intelligence to monitor offensive material in live video streams. The company said on Wednesday that the updated tools would give an option to users watching a live video to reach out to the person directly and report the video to Facebook. Facebook Inc (FB.O) will also provide resources, which include reaching out to a friend and contacting a help line, to the user reporting the live video. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for 15-29 year olds. Suicide rates jumped 24 percent in the United States between 1999 and 2014 after a period of nearly consistent decline, according to a National Center for Health Statistics study. "
2017-05-04,-2,"Rubin added that Oculus is “still absolutely committed to growing the VR film and creative content ecosystem.”  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said he believed the medium that offers a 360-degree panoramic view using headsets “will become a part of daily life for billions of people.”  Oculus tapped talent from both Oscar-winning animation company Pixar and the video gaming world to head up Story Studio, which it launched in January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival.  Facebook’s VR ambitions have been threatened somewhat by a lawsuit from video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc accusing Facebook and Oculus of infringing ZeniMax’s copyrighted software code.  A jury found in ZeniMax’s favor in February, awarding it $500 million. Oculus has asked for a new trial.  Vive, a unit of HTC Corp, and Sony Corp are also racing to bring virtual reality products to a mass audience.  Oculus debuted its first short film called “Lost” at Sundance two years ago, a story of an animated mechanical creature in a forest.  Last year, Story Studio won an Emmy for original interactive program for its short VR film “Henry,” and at Sundance this year, it premiered “Dear Angelica,” an illustrated film of a mother and daughter.   But internally, Oculus has undergone some changes in its management in the past year.  Brendan Iribe stepped down as CEO in December, saying he was going to head up the PC division of the VR company. In March, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, who created the prototype Oculus headset, parted ways with Facebook. "
2017-07-30,-2,"“But certainly women applying for jobs at the same rate as men, women running for office at the same rate as men, that’s got to be part of the answer.” The issue of women earning less than men arose again earlier this month, when the BBC was forced to reveal the pay of its journalists and presenters. Men earning more than 150,000 pounds ($197,000) a year outnumbered women by two to one, and the broadcaster’s top-ranking man received more than four times the amount of its highest-paid woman. Sandberg, one of the most influential Silicon Valley executives and the author of the 2013 book “Lean In”, said women undervalued the contribution they could make in business. “We start telling little girls not to lead at very young ages and we start telling little boys to lead at a very young ages, and that’s a mistake” she told interviewer Kirsty Young on the long-running radio show Desert Island Discs. “I believe everyone has inside them the ability to lead and we should let people choose that, not based on gender but on who they are and who they want to be.” Sandberg also discussed the efforts that Facebook was taking to keep the platform and its messaging service WhatsApp from being used to promote and discuss militant attacks.  Speaking about a meeting with British interior minister Amber Rudd, she said the company and the British government were “very aligned in our goals”.  “We want to make sure all of us do our part to stop terrorism, and so our Facebook policies are very clear: there’s absolutely no place for terrorism, hate, calls for violence of any kind,” she said. Rudd has called on tech companies to do more stop extremists posting content on their platforms and using encrypted messaging services to plan attacks.   “As technology evolves these are complicated conversations, we’re in close communication working through the issues all around the world,” Sandberg said on Sunday.

2017-11-01,-15,"Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg condemned Russia’s attempts to influence last year’s election through Facebook posts and advertisements designed to sow division, and repeated his pledge to ramp up spending to confront the problem. Zuckerberg said that spending would include 10,000 additional people to review content on the network, though based on past practice many of those people will be contractors. The spending would hit profits, Facebook said, with expenses expected to grow by 45 percent to 60 percent next year. “What they did is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it,” Zuckerberg said of the Russians, on a conference call with analysts. The company’s share price, which hit a record $182.90 earlier on Wednesday, initially rose in after-hours trading, but later fell into negative territory on discussion of the higher spending. Shares have gained almost 60 percent this year. “While the investigations into Russian activity on the platform have been getting a lot of attention, they’re not detracting from Facebook’s power as an ad platform,” analyst Debra Aho Williamson of research firm eMarketer said in an interview.  The political storm in the United States over how Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google handle false news stories and political manipulation of their services gathered strength this week as three separate congressional committees held hearings.  Zuckerberg did not appear at the hearings. But lawmakers  threatened tougher regulation and fired questions at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, excoriating the company for being slow to act and slow to share what it knew with Congress. The chief executive told analysts that legislation to force disclosure of election ads “would be very good if done well.”  In a series of disclosures over two months, Facebook has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years. Russia denies any meddling. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $9.71 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet. Facebook in the third quarter gave advertisers for the first time the ability to run ads in standalone videos, outside the Facebook News Feed, and the company is seeing good early results, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts.  More than 70 percent of ad breaks up to 15 seconds long were viewed to completion, most with the sound on, she said.  Facebook executives, though, declined to give details on the performance so far of Watch, a video tab the company rolled out two months ago. “It’s too early to be talking about any stats there,” Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in response to an analyst question.  Zuckerberg said Facebook would be spending heavily in making the Watch tab a place where “people want to talk and connect around,” rather than a spot to passively consume programs.  The 49 percent increase in total ad sales in the latest quarter compares with a 47 percent rise in the prior quarter and a 51 percent jump in the first quarter. Facebook has been warning for more than a year about reaching a limit in “ad load”, or the number of ads the company can feature in users’ pages before crowding their News Feed. Advertisers seem unfazed, though, spending heavily as the social network continues to attract users. The average price per ad rose 35 percent.  The nearly 50 percent jump in ad revenue “is phenomenal, especially when for the past few quarters they’ve been trying to bring that expectation way, way down. Yet it keeps going up,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.  Of the Russia scandal enveloping Facebook publicly, Feinseth said: “In the bigger picture, I don’t think it’s a really big factor.”  The company’s performance was strong in comparison with smaller social media firms Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Twitter, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.  “Facebook grew revenues by $3.3 billion year-over-year for the quarter. This is more than Twitter and Snapchat generate combined for the full year,” he said.  Facebook said about 2.07 billion people were using its service monthly, up 16 percent from a year earlier. Net income rose to $4.71 billion, or $1.59 per share, from $2.63 billion, or 90 cents per share. Analysts on an average were expecting the company to earn $1.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue increased 47.3 percent to $10.33 billion beating analysts’ estimate of $9.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  "
2017-07-10,-9,"Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price.  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would “become a part of daily life for billions of people.”  Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy.  The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said: “We’re now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.”  Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March.  In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers.  Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement. Oculus has asked for a new trial.  "

2017-04-19,2,"Dugan told software developers at Facebook’s annual F8 conference that the company was modeling Building 8 after DARPA, a government office founded in the 1950s that gave the world the internet and the miniaturized GPS receivers used in consumer devices.  Any hardware rollouts are years away, Dugan said in a speech. Potential products could, if successful, be a way for Facebook to diversify beyond its heavy reliance on advertising revenue.  One example of Building 8’s work so far, Dugan said, was an attempt to improve technology that allows people to type words using their minds.  “It sounds impossible, but it’s closer than you may realize,” Dugan said.  Possible uses include helping disabled people and “the ability to text your friend without taking out your phone,” she said.  A video played at the conference showed two Facebook employees talking to each other through touch. As one employee, Frances, wore an electronic device on her arm, the other, Freddy, used a computer program to send pressure changes to her arm.  “If you ask Frances what she feels,” Dugan said, “she’ll tell you that she has learned to feel the acoustic shape of a word on her arm.” In December, Facebook signed a deal with 17 universities including Harvard and Princeton to allow swifter collaboration on projects with Dugan’s team.

2017-04-14,-9,"“Facebook is highly vulnerable, as fake news promoters are spamming their way to visibility for fake news through strategically gaming Facebook’s algorithms and publishing platform,” the proposal states.  “In light of the societal crisis generated by the explosion of fake news and related hate speech, failure to effectively manage this issue creates public policy risk,” it said.  The issue of fake news came to prominence during the U.S. presidential election last year, when many inaccurate posts were widely shared on Facebook and other social media services. Facebook has said it is tackling the problem.

2017-05-16,-5,"Other new features include a rewind mode for videos, which will allow users to play video in reverse, and hashtag stickers to visit hashtag pages. Facebook has been amping up its camera tool to take on Snapchat’s features such as disappearing messages and face-tracking filters, which are hugely popular among its teenaged and millennial users. The world’s largest social media network has already added several Snapchat-like features such as Stories, which allows users to upload pictures and video slideshows that disappear after 24 hours. For now, Instagram does not have sponsored face filters, where advertisers can create their own content. Snapchat’s “sponsored lenses” have become a major part of its advertising revenue.  “If we’re being honest with ourselves, this is the way the tech industry works and frankly, it’s how all industries work,” said Instagram’s head of product Kevin Weil at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, when asked about the similarities between Instagram’s new features and Snap’s existing ones. “Kudos to Snapchat for being the first to Stories, but it’s a format and it’s going to be adopted widely across a lot of different platforms.” Instagram said in April over 200 million people used Stories daily. Snap, in its first earnings report as a listed company last week, said it had 166 million daily active users as of March 31. Snap’s shares have been on a roller-coaster ride since their market debut on March 1. The stock plunged about 23 percent last week after the company posted disappointing quarterly results. However, it recouped some of those losses after several institutional investors including George Soros and Daniel Loeb disclosed stakes in the company. On Tuesday, Snap shares were down 1.9 percent at $20.37 while Facebook’s shares were up 0.3 percent at $149.77. "

Thailand’s Ministry of Digital Economy said it contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos. They were taken down at around 5 p.m. in Bangkok on Tuesday, nearly a day after they had been uploaded. "

The lawsuit comes as Facebook weighs its options following a $500 million verdict in an unrelated lawsuit brought over its VR technology by video game developer ZeniMax Media Inc. A Dallas federal jury in February found Oculus used copyrighted computer code developed by video game designer John Carmack while employed at ZeniMax. Lawyers for Oculus and Facebook have said they will seek to have the verdict set aside. ImmersiON-VRelia makes VR headsets similar to the Oculus Rift, as well as a VR device for use with smartphones. Techno View said in its lawsuit ImmersiON-VRelia’s chief executive, Manuel Gutierrez Novelo, attained several patents between 2003 and 2006 on various aspects of VR technology. Techno View said Oculus and Facebook specifically infringed a patent held by ImmersiON-VRelia on a method of generating left and right perspectives in a 3D video game. Techno View said it may add claims relating to other patents  owned ImmersiON-VRelia at a later date. Facebook acquired Oculus for an estimated $3 billion in 2014.

Viewers of the live broadcast alerted police who swooped on an apartment in the city and detained the men. Two of the men were convicted of rape and the third, who received a six-month sentence, of failing to report the crime and defamation for broadcasting it. The court did not give their ages but said they were born between 1992 and 1998. The men had denied the charges, saying the woman had given consent to having sex with them. However, the court said the woman had been heavily intoxicated by alcohol and drugs and was in a very vulnerable situation.  “It is not possible for a person in that situation to give consent.

2017-07-27,-16,"Facebook said in April it had taken action against fake accounts that were spreading misinformation about the French election. But the effort to infiltrate the social networks of Macron officials has not previously been reported. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the French election by hacking and leaking emails and documents. U.S. intelligence agencies told Reuters in May that hackers with connections to the Russian government were involved, but they did not have conclusive evidence that the Kremlin ordered the hacking. Facebook confirmed to Reuters that it had detected spying accounts in France and deactivated them. It credited a combination of improved automated detection and stepped-up  human efforts to find sophisticated attacks.  Company officials briefed congressional committee members and staff, among others, about their findings. People involved in the conversations also said the number of Facebook accounts suspended in France for promoting propaganda or spam - much of it related to the election - had climbed to 70,000, a big jump from the 30,000 account closures the company disclosed in April.  Facebook did not dispute the figure.  On Thursday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the accusations that Russia had attempted to influence the French election as “a lie and not true”. Facebook employees noticed the efforts during the first round of the presidential election and traced them to tools used in the past by Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit, said the people, who spoke on condition they not be named because they were discussing sensitive government and private intelligence.  The same GRU unit, dubbed Fancy Bear or APT 28 in the cybersecurity industry, has been blamed for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and many other political targets.  The Kremlin referred all questions about the GRU to the Russian Defence Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. French law enforcement and intelligence officials have not publicly accused anyone of the campaign attacks. Mounir Mahjoubi, who was digital director of Macron’s political movement, En Marche, and is now a junior minister for digital issues in his government, told Reuters in May that some security experts blamed the GRU specifically, though they had no proof.  Mahjoubi and En Marche declined to comment. There are few publicly known examples of sophisticated social media spying efforts. In 2015, Britain’s domestic security service, MI5, warned that hostile powers were using LinkedIn to connect with and try to recruit government workers. The social media and networking companies themselves rarely comment on such operations when discovered.  Facebook, facing mounting pressure from governments around the world to control ”fake news’ and propaganda on the service, took a step toward openness with a report in April on what it termed “information operations”.  The bulk of that document discussed so-called influence operations, which included “amplifier” accounts that spread links to slanted or false news stories in order to influence public opinion. "
2017-04-10,-1,"The company said in September that it had 4 million advertisers, and in March 2016 that it had 3 million. The world’s largest social network, which is free to users, has 1.9 billion people on it. Facebook is locked in a battle with Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) for dominance in digital advertising. The two Silicon Valley giants are expected to soak up some 46 percent of online ad spending in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer.  Much of that spending is by big brand advertisers, but to attract small firms, Facebook pitches a set of tools such as audience targeting, a mobile design studio and online courses available so far in 10 languages.  The latest changes include a “one click” option in Facebook’s ads manager to reinstate high-performing ads, and a desktop tool to manage customer messages, the company said. “Small businesses provide such important products and services, but they also are a huge engine of job growth in a world where job growth is increasingly uncertain and something people really worry about,” Sandberg said.  Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail, the company said. Some 75 percent of them are outside the United States, and its fastest-growing markets are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the company said.  Nearly 50 percent of the advertisers create ads on mobile devices, reflecting the increasing importance of smartphone-based usage to Facebook’s future.  More than 90 percent of Facebook’s users access the network through mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, the company said in February.  "

More than 40 percent of American mothers are the primary breadwinners for their families, she said, and many of them are the only breadwinner.  Sandberg’s message was accompanied by a picture of her with her mother and mother-in-law on the day of her wedding to former SurveyMonkey Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg, who died in 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia. In “Lean In,” she encouraged women to be more ambitious in the workplace. Following Goldberg’s death, she co-wrote the book “Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy” that was published this year.  Sandberg called for more protections for mothers, fathers, gay and transgender parents as well as for adoptive parents who seek a leave of absence from their job to care for a child or other family member. “We shouldn’t have to risk losing a job or being able to meet the basic needs of our families to do that,” Sandberg said. Sandberg, one of the wealthiest American women with a net worth of $1.38 billion, said the United States is one of the only developed countries not to guarantee paid family or maternity leave. Sandberg also said American parents need affordable childcare. In the United States, the cost of daycare for two children is more than the median annual rent in all 50 states, she said.  “How are parents supposed to work if they don’t have a safe and affordable place to leave their kids?” she asked. While President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has publicly stated her support for paid maternity leave, her father has not articulated a clear position on such benefits, as well as the other issues Sandberg raised in her post. In a Mother’s Day Facebook post last year, Sandberg called for greater public and corporate support for single, working mothers.

2017-04-13,-4,"Facebook is under intense pressure in Europe as governments across the continent threaten new laws and fines unless the company moves quickly to remove extremist propaganda or other content that violates local laws. (reut.rs/2oBwHEO). The pressure on social media sites including Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Facebook has intensified in the run-up to the elections in France and Germany. Facebook already has a program in France to use outside fact-checkers to combat fake news in users’ feeds. Also on Thursday, Facebook took out full-page ads in Germany’s best-selling newspapers to educate readers on how to spot fake news. U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. election last year in order to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Officials say a similar campaign is under way in Europe to promote right-wing, nationalist parties and undermine the European Union.  In a blog post, Facebook said it was acting against 30,000 fake accounts in France. It said its priority was to remove suspect accounts with high volumes of posting activity and the biggest audiences.  Two people familiar with Facebook’s process said the company had strengthened its formula for detecting deceptive accounts being run by automated means. As an example, the new process considers accounts that have smaller circles of friends and that therefore had been less of a priority previously. A key motivator was the need to get tougher on misinformation ahead of the French elections, the people said, although the move also targets accounts that generated spam for financial gain.   “We’ve made improvements to recognize these inauthentic accounts more easily by identifying patterns of activity — without assessing the content itself,” Shabnam Shaik, a Facebook security team manager, wrote in an official blog post. The company is using automated pattern-recognition to identify repeated posting of the same content and increases in messaging. Thursday’s action follows other moves by Facebook to make it easier for users to report potential fraud and hoaxes. "

2017-05-25,-5,"“There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in ten years when millions of students can’t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business,” Zuckerberg told the crowd on a cold, drizzly day when graduates’ dark academic robes stood in contrast to the brightly colored plastic rain ponchos scattered through the audience. “When you don’t have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise we all lose,” said Zuckerberg, who was also named an honorary doctor of laws. He offered no specific solutions to the problems he highlighted, but urged graduates to contemplate them. Today some 1.9 billion people use Facebook each month. Its broad reach has made the company a lightning rod for controversy, most recently for the ways that producers of fake news stories used it to influence public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and for a pair of incidents last month in which users posted videos of two murders, one of them live. Earlier in the day the website of the school’s student newspaper, The Crimson, was briefly filled with satirical headlines about Zuckerberg. The newspaper on Twitter apologized to its readers for the incident. Zuckerberg’s speech was not the first time a successful dropout returned to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to address graduates. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates spoke to graduates in 2007, shortly after saying that he would step away from his day-to-day role with the world’s largest software company to focus his time on philanthropy.

Men earning more than 150,000 pounds ($197,000) a year outnumbered women by two to one, and the broadcaster’s top-ranking man received more than four times the amount of its highest-paid woman. Sandberg, one of the most influential Silicon Valley executives and the author of the 2013 book “Lean In”, said women undervalued the contribution they could make in business. “We start telling little girls not to lead at very young ages and we start telling little boys to lead at a very young ages, and that’s a mistake” she told interviewer Kirsty Young on the long-running radio show Desert Island Discs. “I believe everyone has inside them the ability to lead and we should let people choose that, not based on gender but on who they are and who they want to be.” Sandberg also discussed the efforts that Facebook was taking to keep the platform and its messaging service WhatsApp from being used to promote and discuss militant attacks.  Speaking about a meeting with British interior minister Amber Rudd, she said the company and the British government were “very aligned in our goals”.  “We want to make sure all of us do our part to stop terrorism, and so our Facebook policies are very clear: there’s absolutely no place for terrorism, hate, calls for violence of any kind,” she said. Rudd has called on tech companies to do more stop extremists posting content on their platforms and using encrypted messaging services to plan attacks.   “As technology evolves these are complicated conversations, we’re in close communication working through the issues all around the world,” Sandberg said on Sunday.

2017-04-17,-10,"U.S. authorities have widened a manhunt for the murder suspect who, according to police, posted a video of himself on the social media site shooting an elderly man in Cleveland. Police said they had received dozens of tips about the possible location of the suspect, Steve Stephens, and repeatedly suggested he turn himself in. The shooting was the latest violent incident shown on Facebook, raising questions about how the company moderates huge amounts of content uploaded from around the world. Facebook relies largely on its 1.9 billion users to report items that violate its terms of service. Millions of items are reported each week in more than 40 languages and thousands of workers review them, Osofsky said in the statement, posted on a company blog. “We prioritize reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,” Osofsky said. The company, which recently began to allow advertising breaks in live video streams, has also tried to automate the process for flagging offensive material. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook released a timeline of events related to Stephens, something it had not done after other violent incidents.  Stephens posted three videos, Facebook said. In the first, uploaded at 2:09 p.m. EDT on Sunday (1809 GMT), he said he intended to commit murder. No one reported it, according to Facebook.  Two minutes later at 2:11 p.m. EDT, Stephens uploaded a video of the shooting. And a third video, with a confession to murder, was broadcast live at 2:22 and reported by someone shortly after it ended at 2:27 p.m. EDT. The shooting video was not reported by Facebook users until 3:59 p.m. EDT and Stephens’ account was disabled at 4:22 p.m. EDT, Facebook’s timeline showed. “We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better,” Osofsky said.  "

2017-10-19,-9,"The legislation would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements on platforms like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.  “Our laws have failed to keep up with evolving technology and the capabilities of our foreign adversaries,” Klobuchar told a news conference. The measure would also require digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than $500. And it would require online platforms to make “all reasonable efforts” to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not buying political advertisements to influence the U.S. electorate. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Representative Mike Coffman and Democrat Derek Kilmer. Social media companies have become an increasing focus of congressional investigations into allegations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election on behalf of Republican candidate Donald Trump, something now-President Trump and Moscow deny. Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, said $150,000 of ads paid for in rubles may be only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of how many political advertisements were bought by foreign firms. He said advertisements could have been purchased using dollars, euros or pounds. U.S. law bars foreigners from spending money to attempt to influence American elections. Warner and Klobuchar acknowledged that the companies have resisted the legislation. But Warner said, “It’s our hope that the social media companies and platform companies will work with us.” Social media companies have begun a lobbying campaign to at least influence, if not prevent, the bill. The companies said they are open to working with Congress and have been turning over information, but are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. Facebook has turned over thousands of ads to congressional investigators and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, met with members of Congress last week. Google said it was look at steps it could take on its various platforms and would work closely with Congress, the Federal Election Commission and the industry to come up with solutions. “We support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse,” Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in an emailed statement.  Klobuchar and Warner said it was possible the measure could be offered an amendment to another larger piece of legislation. Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating the alleged Russian hacking and the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Klobuchar is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which helps oversee elections. And McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

He said advertisements could have been purchased using dollars, euros or pounds. U.S. law bars foreigners from spending money to attempt to influence American elections. Warner and Klobuchar acknowledged that the companies have resisted the legislation. But Warner said, “It’s our hope that the social media companies and platform companies will work with us.” Social media companies have begun a lobbying campaign to at least influence, if not prevent, the bill. The companies said they are open to working with Congress and have been turning over information, but are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. Facebook has turned over thousands of ads to congressional investigators and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, met with members of Congress last week. Google said it was look at steps it could take on its various platforms and would work closely with Congress, the Federal Election Commission and the industry to come up with solutions. “We support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse,” Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in an emailed statement.  Klobuchar and Warner said it was possible the measure could be offered an amendment to another larger piece of legislation. Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating the alleged Russian hacking and the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Klobuchar is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which helps oversee elections. And McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. They said they would like it to become law by early next year, well ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, in which every seat in the 435-member House and about one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs Many lawmakers and other U.S. officials have said they fear Russian efforts to meddle in those polls as well. Separately, Facebook, Twitter and Google said Thursday they would send their general counsels to testify Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. General counsel Colin Stretch will be the Facebook representative to testify before both committees, company spokesman Andy Stone said. The company’s high-profile Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sandberg will not appear. A Twitter spokeswoman said Acting General Counsel Sean Edgett will represent the microblogging site. A Google spokeswoman said General Counsel Kent Walker would represent that company. "

2017-04-07,-4,"According to the complaint filed in federal court in Delaware, ImmersiON-VRelia, which has offices in Spain and California, agreed to let Techno View litigate the patent on its behalf. The lawsuit comes as Facebook weighs its options following a $500 million verdict in an unrelated lawsuit brought over its VR technology by video game developer ZeniMax Media Inc. A Dallas federal jury in February found Oculus used copyrighted computer code developed by video game designer John Carmack while employed at ZeniMax. Lawyers for Oculus and Facebook have said they will seek to have the verdict set aside.  ImmersiON-VRelia makes VR headsets similar to the Oculus Rift, as well as a VR device for use with smartphones. Techno View said in its lawsuit ImmersiON-VRelia’s chief executive, Manuel Gutierrez Novelo, attained several patents between 2003 and 2006 on various aspects of VR technology.  Techno View said Oculus and Facebook specifically infringed a patent held by ImmersiON-VRelia on a method of generating left and right perspectives in a 3D video game. Techno View said it may add claims relating to other patents  owned ImmersiON-VRelia at a later date. Facebook acquired Oculus for an estimated $3 billion in 2014. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has predicted that virtual reality “will be part of people’s daily lives,” revolutionizing industries like media, education and medicine. Facebook and Oculus did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Techno View’s lawsuit. The case is Techno View IP Inc v. Oculus VR LLC and Facebook Inc, 17cv00386, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. "
2017-04-19,2,"Dugan told software developers at Facebook’s annual F8 conference that the company was modeling Building 8 after DARPA, a government office founded in the 1950s that gave the world the internet and the miniaturized GPS receivers used in consumer devices.  Any hardware rollouts are years away, Dugan said in a speech. Potential products could, if successful, be a way for Facebook to diversify beyond its heavy reliance on advertising revenue.  One example of Building 8’s work so far, Dugan said, was an attempt to improve technology that allows people to type words using their minds.  “It sounds impossible, but it’s closer than you may realize,” Dugan said.  Possible uses include helping disabled people and “the ability to text your friend without taking out your phone,” she said.  A video played at the conference showed two Facebook employees talking to each other through touch. As one employee, Frances, wore an electronic device on her arm, the other, Freddy, used a computer program to send pressure changes to her arm.  “If you ask Frances what she feels,” Dugan said, “she’ll tell you that she has learned to feel the acoustic shape of a word on her arm.” In December, Facebook signed a deal with 17 universities including Harvard and Princeton to allow swifter collaboration on projects with Dugan’s team.

2017-04-05,-7,"“Revenge porn” refers to the sharing of sexually explicit images on the internet, without the consent of the people depicted in the pictures, in order to extort or humiliate them. The practice disproportionately affects women, who are sometimes targeted by former partners. Facebook has been sued in the United States and elsewhere by people who said it should have done more to prevent the practice. The company in 2015 made clear that images “shared in revenge” were forbidden, and users have long had the ability to report posts as violating the terms of service. Beginning on Wednesday, users of the world’s largest social network should see an option to report a picture as inappropriate specifically because it is a “nude photo of me,” Facebook said in a statement. The company also said it was launching an automated process to prevent the repeat sharing of banned images. Photo-matching software will keep the pictures off the core Facebook network as well as off its Instagram and Messenger services, it said. Users who share “revenge porn” may see their accounts disabled, the company said. Facing criticism, the company last year met representatives from more than 150 women’s safety organizations and decided it needed to do more, Antigone Davis, global head of safety at Facebook, said in a phone interview. A specially trained group of Facebook employees will provide human review of each reported image, Davis said. The process to prevent repeat sharing requires Facebook to retain the banned pictures in a database, although the images are blurred and only a small number of employees have access to the database, the company said. Prosecutors and lawmakers have also sought ways to prevent the spread of “revenge porn,” seeking additional penalties for a practice that they said has ruined careers and families and even led to suicide."

2017-04-10,-1,"The company said in September that it had 4 million advertisers, and in March 2016 that it had 3 million. The world’s largest social network, which is free to users, has 1.9 billion people on it. Facebook is locked in a battle with Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) for dominance in digital advertising. The two Silicon Valley giants are expected to soak up some 46 percent of online ad spending in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer.  Much of that spending is by big brand advertisers, but to attract small firms, Facebook pitches a set of tools such as audience targeting, a mobile design studio and online courses available so far in 10 languages.  The latest changes include a “one click” option in Facebook’s ads manager to reinstate high-performing ads, and a desktop tool to manage customer messages, the company said. “Small businesses provide such important products and services, but they also are a huge engine of job growth in a world where job growth is increasingly uncertain and something people really worry about,” Sandberg said.  Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail, the company said. Some 75 percent of them are outside the United States, and its fastest-growing markets are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, the company said.  Nearly 50 percent of the advertisers create ads on mobile devices, reflecting the increasing importance of smartphone-based usage to Facebook’s future.  More than 90 percent of Facebook’s users access the network through mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, the company said in February.  "

2017-04-04,-23,"By a 5-1 vote, the Court of Appeals said it lacked jurisdiction to hear Facebook’s appeal over warrants obtained by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The decision is a defeat for Internet privacy advocates such as the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as technology and social media companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Twitter that supported Facebook’s appeal. Prosecutors had in July 2013 obtained the warrants ordering Facebook to turn over account information belonging to people suspected of criminal fraud. Sixty-two of the Facebook users were later indicted in the probe, out of 134 overall, court papers show. Among the targets were retired police officers and firefighters suspected of feigning illness after the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Facebook argued that the warrants were overbroad, and that Vance went too far by prohibiting the Menlo Park, California-based company from telling users that the warrants existed. It complied with the warrants after prosecutors threatened to hold it in criminal contempt, but continued the appeal. Writing for the appeals court, Judge Leslie Stein said it was up to targets of the warrants, not third parties such as Facebook, to challenge the warrants’ validity. While Facebook’s concern about overbroad warrants, and its effect on users’ privacy rights including under the U.S. Constitution, “may not be baseless,” it was up to the state legislature to change the law, Stein wrote. Tuesday’s decision upheld a July 2015 ruling by an state appeals court in Manhattan. One judge recused himself. Judge Rowan Wilson dissented, saying the decision deprived Facebook of “any meaningful recourse” against the “en masse” data seizure, including from high school students who had the misfortune of knowing people suspected of disability fraud. “Although seizing social media content to help curtain widespread disabilities fraud may seem to some a good bargain,” Wilson wrote, “the concern of this case ... is not with crime waves, but with the protection of the individual against the power of the government.” Facebook said it was disappointed by the decision and evaluating its legal options, but “encouraged to see the thorough dissent that supports Facebook’s position arguing for people’s online privacy.” Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Vance, said his office was pleased with the outcome.

2017-04-18,-1,"Pokemon Go, jointly developed by Nintendo Co and Niantic Inc, has generated masses of followers around the world as players use their phones to capture animated characters that appear in real locations. Other uses of augmented reality have included the ability to hang out with a hologram of “Mad Men” star Jon Hamm or assemble a virtual human brain, all on mobile devices. A recent push by Facebook to add camera features to its suite of smartphone apps will help the company popularize similar features, Zuckerberg said.  “Even if we were a little slow to add cameras to all our apps, I‘m confident that now we’re going to push this augmented reality platform forward,” he said.  Zuckerberg said people could use the technology to leave a virtual note for a friend at a bar, or to find virtual street art on a wall that in real life is blank. Eventually, he said, people would use augmented reality on eyewear, although he did not give any details about possible Facebook hardware.  In 2014, Facebook acquired its Oculus virtual reality goggles unit for $2 billion, although that division is a long way from making a mass-market product or contributing significantly to the company’s earnings. As part of his conference address, Zuckerberg addressed shortcomings on another major project, Facebook’s push into video. He said the service needed to do more to prevent the spread of violent videos, such as one on Sunday of a fatal shooting in Cleveland that was visible on the site for two hours. "

Facebook data indicate the social media app has about 25-30 million active users in Pakistan even though Internet penetration remains poor in the South Asian nation. Facebook’s Instagram unit and rival Twitter are also popular. The ruling PML-N party’s tough talk against blasphemy will appeal to its conservative voter base ahead of elections likely to take place next year. At least 65 people, including lawyers, defendants and judges, have been murdered by Islamist militants over blasphemy allegations in Pakistan since 1990, according to think-tank figures and local media.

2017-03-28,-2,"With an update scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, Facebook will allow users to get to the app’s camera with one swipe of their finger and then add visual details like a rainbow or a beard of glitter. Users will be able to share a picture privately with a friend, rather than to all of their friends, and add a picture to a gallery known as a “story,” similar to a feature on the Snapchat app. Snapchat popularized sharing of digitally decorated photographs on social media, especially among teenagers, and exposed a weakness of Facebook as the companies battle for eyeballs and leisure time.  Snap has recently emphasized its ambitions to build gadgets and has called itself a camera company rather than a social media network. Some analysts have warned that Snap is susceptible to competition from Facebook. “Our goal here is to give people more to do on Facebook, and that’s really been the main inspiration,” Connor Hayes, a Facebook product manager, said in a briefing with reporters.  In a glimpse of how the features could tie in with other businesses, one of the first camera effects will be the ability to morph someone in a photograph into a yellow, cartoon “Minion.” The latest Minion movie, “Despicable Me 3,” is due out in a few months from Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBC Universal.  Facebook has deals to license content from six film studios, as well as from two artists, said design director Kristen Spilman.  Another visual effect allows someone in a picture to “become a laser cat with super powers,” Spilman said. The effects will vary by location. Spilman said that when Facebook tested the ability to add the phrase “LOL,” the acronym for “laugh out loud,” users in Ireland did not know what it meant. "

The mother of the victim of the March assault had approached police after an unrelated news conference and shown them images of her daughter being assaulted by five or six young men. The mother said the girl’s uncle had told her about a video on Facebook Live that showed the assault. The high school freshman had gone to the store and her mother became concerned when she did not return. The March incident was among several in recent months in Chicago in which the social media site has played a role in broadcasting apparent crimes. The shooting death in February on the city’s West Side of a 2-year-old boy was captured on Facebook Live by his aunt, who was also shot. In January, an attack by four people on a 19-year-old man with special needs was partially broadcast on the social media site. The four accused in the attack have pleaded not guilty.

2017-02-21,6,"TransferWise’s chatbot enables customers to send money to friends and family to and from the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and Europe from Facebook Messenger. It can also be used to set up exchange rate alerts. Facebook already allows its users to send money domestically in the United States via its Messenger app, but has not yet launched similar services internationally. TransferWise said its service will be the first to enable international money transfers entirely within Messenger.  Facebook opened up its Messenger app to developers to create chatbots in April in a bid to expand its reach in customer service and enterprise transactions. Chatbots have become a hot topic in enterprise technology over the past year because recent advances in artificial intelligence have made them better at interacting. Businesses, including banks, are hoping that they can be used to improve and reduce the cost of their customer service operations. One of Europe’s most well-known fintech companies, TransferWise was launched in 2011 by Estonian friends Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann out of frustration with the high fees they were being charged by banks for international money transfers.  The company, which is valued at more than $1 billion, is backed by several high profile investors including Silicon Valley venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, and PayPal co-founders Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, through his fund Valar Ventures.  Customers in more than 50 countries send roughly $1 billion through its website every month. While the TransferWise chatbot is now only available in Facebook Messenger it can be adapted to work with other popular chat services, Scott Miller, head of global partnerships for TransferWise said. He said the service would eventually be extended to work in other countries and money transfer routes that the company operates in.  The launch comes as competition in the mobile payments and international money transfer sectors intensifies. Earlier this month PayPal Holdings Inc  announced its U.S. payments application Venmo would be available within popular chat service Slack.  While in January , Ant Financial Services, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said it would acquire U.S. money-transfer company MoneyGram, in a deal that is expected to shake up the international payments landscape.

2017-02-16,-4,"Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when many people and nations around the world are taking an increasingly inward view. U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to put “America first” in his inaugural address in January. That followed Britain’s decision last June to exit the European Union. “Across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection,” Zuckerberg wrote, without naming specific movements.  The question, the 32-year-old executive said, was whether “the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course,” adding that he stands for bringing people together. Quoting from a letter Lincoln wrote to Congress in the depths of the Civil War, he wrote to Facebook’s 1.9 billion users: “The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present.”  In comments on Facebook, some users praised Zuckerberg’s note for staying positive, while others declared “globalism” dead.  Facebook has been under pressure to more closely police hoaxes, fake news and other controversial content, although the concerns have had little impact on its finances. The company reported 2016 revenue of $27.6 billion, up 54 percent from a year earlier.  One area where Zuckerberg wrote that Facebook would do better would be suggesting “meaningful communities.” Some 100 million users are members of groups that are “very meaningful” to them, he wrote, representing only about 5 percent of users. Facebook is also using artificial intelligence more to flag photos and videos that need human review, Zuckerberg wrote. One-third of all reports to Facebook’s review team are generated by artificial intelligence, he wrote.  Zuckerberg’s letter was “a bit more ambitious and a bit more of the 30,000-foot view than I see from most tech company CEOs,” Peter Micek, global policy and legal counsel at Access Now, an international digital rights group, said in a phone interview. But Zuckerberg stayed away from certain subjects on which Facebook could be vulnerable to criticism, mentioning the word “privacy” only once, Micek said. "

Sharing location information is optional, but it can also be live, so that once a user shares the information with a friend, the friend can watch the user’s movement for up to 60 minutes.  Messenger was once part of the core Facebook smartphone app, but the company broke it out as a separate app in 2014 and has since invested in frequent changes to build a service distinct from the massive social network.  Google Maps said last week that it was adding a similar live feature, an attempt to boost engagement on a product of increasing strategic importance to that company.  The close proximity of the announcements tells Facebook “that we’re working on the right things,” Chudnovsky said. The Messages app on Apple’s iPhone has such a feature, too.  Facebook has been testing its change in Mexico, he said. It was ready as long ago as October, he added, but the company worked on it for five more months to minimize the impact on the battery life of phones.  Facebook sees the feature being used for convenience to coordinate with friends, for safety-related purposes or for other uses, Chudnovsky said. “There are all sorts of products that you can imagine you could build on top of that,” he said. The update is being made available globally, the company said. "

Facebook, the world’s largest social network, said last week that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the site during a two-year period through May 2017. U.S. Senator Mark Warner on Tuesday said he was “disappointed” in Facebook for failing to present the latest information during a briefing last week with staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating allegations of election interference. “We’re seeing more evidence of additional ads and how they are used to manipulate individuals,” Warner, the committee’s vice chairman, told reporters. Facebook said it will continue working with U.S. authorities as necessary. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that his government interfered with the U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump prevailed over Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Daily Beast, the news website that first reported on the promoted events posted on Facebook, said one advertisement promoted an anti-immigrant rally in Idaho in August 2016. The rally was hosted by a Facebook group called “Secured Borders,” which was a Russian front and is now suspended, according to the Daily Beast. Some 48 people on Facebook expressed an interest in the Idaho event and four said they went, according to a copy of the event page archived by Google’s search engine. The Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency in elections, on Tuesday sent a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg asking that the company publicly release the content of the alleged Russia-linked political ads. “Releasing those advertisements could allow the country to better understand the nature and extent of foreign interference with our democracy,” the center’s president, Trevor Potter, wrote.

2017-09-20,-6,"Sandberg said in a post on her Facebook page the company would have more manual review of the targeting options it gives advertisers, a change that she said would strengthen the system after a report Facebook had allowed advertisers to market to self-described “Jew haters.”  ProPublica, a non-profit news organization based in New York, reported last week that it was possible to buy Facebook ads targeted to people who, on their Facebook profiles, had listed anti-Semitic topics in their field of study or work.  Once people put those phrases on their Facebook profiles, the topics automatically migrated onto the company’s advertising platform, as if they were education or job data that would be useful to marketers. Facebook temporarily disabled some targeting capabilities last week in response to the ProPublica investigation.  Sandberg, who is Jewish, said in her post: “The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.”  Facebook should have discovered the unintended feature on its own, Sandberg added. The company would create a program to encourage people on Facebook to report potential abuses of its ads system directly to the company, she said.  U.S. lawmakers have separately criticized Facebook for allowing Russian operatives to buy U.S. political ads before and after the 2016 elections. Sandberg’s post did not mention the alleged Russian ads."
2017-09-06,-18,"Another $50,000 was spent on 2,200 “potentially politically related” ads, likely by Russians, Facebook said.  U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Non-U.S. citizens may generally advertise on issues. Other ads, such as those that mention a candidate but do not call for the candidate’s election or defeat, fall into what lawyers have called a legal gray area.  Facebook announced the findings in a blog post by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Facebook briefed members of both the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees on Wednesday about the suspected Russia advertising, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. Both committees are conducting probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including potential collusion between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Moscow. Facebook also gave its findings to Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of investigating alleged Russian interference in last year’s presidential election, a source familiar with the matter said. The company produced copies of advertisements as well as data about the buyers, the source said. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Facebook said it found no link between the Russian-purchased advertising and any specific presidential campaign. The ads were mostly national in their focus and did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing-states, the company said. Even if no laws were violated, Facebook said the 470 accounts and pages associated with the ads ran afoul of the social network’s requirements for authenticity and have since been suspended.  Facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages, but some of them included such words as “refugee” and “patriot.”  More than $1 billion was spent on political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, thousands of times more than the presumed Russian spending identified by Facebook’s security team. But the findings buttress U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Russia was actively involved in shaping the election. As recently as June, Facebook told journalists that it had not found any evidence of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform. “TROLL FACTORY” CONNECTION Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called the Facebook report “deeply disturbing and yet fully consistent with the unclassified assessment of the intelligence community.” A Facebook employee said Wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive issue ads and a well-known Russian “troll factory” in St. Petersburg that publishes comments on social media. Ellen Weintraub, a member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said U.S. voters deserve to know where the ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal. “It is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state or local election, directly or indirectly,” Weintraub said in a phone interview.  She declined to comment on the Facebook ads, saying she could not discuss subjects that could come before the agency. Facebook declined to release the ads themselves, prompting a sharp rebuke on Twitter from Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of First Look Media, a producer of feature and documentary films, television and podcasts. “Facebook keeps the targeted political ads it publishes secret, emboldening criminals,” wrote Omidyar, the eBay founder who also provided funding to launch media organization The Intercept. “I don’t see how that can possibly be legal.” Facebook’s disclosure may be the first time a private entity has pointed to receiving Russian money related to U.S. elections, said Brendan Fischer, a program director at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency.  “Whoever may have provided assistance to Russia in buying these Facebook ads is very likely in violation of the law,” he said, adding that Facebook has a legal duty to act if it is aware of similar activity in the future.

2017-10-02,-18,"The ads have sparked anger toward Facebook and, within the United States, toward Russia since the world’s largest social network disclosed their existence last month. Moscow has denied involvement with the ads.  Facebook has faced calls for increased U.S. regulation from U.S. authorities. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has outlined steps that the company plans to take to deter governments from abusing the social media network. Earlier on Monday, Facebook said in a separate statement that it planned to hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms, as part of an effort to deter Russia and other countries from using the platform to interfere in elections. The latest company statement said that about 25 percent of the ads were never shown to anyone.  “That’s because advertising auctions are designed so that ads reach people based on relevance, and certain ads may not reach anyone as a result,” Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of policy and communications, said in the statement. For 99 percent of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent, he said. The total ad spend was $100,000, the company has said.  Still, he said it was possible Facebook would find more Russia-linked U.S. ads as it continues to investigate.  Schrage, while criticizing the ad buyers for using fake accounts, also said many of the ads otherwise “did not violate our content policies” and could have remained if bought using real accounts.  “While we may not always agree with the positions of those who would speak on issues here, we believe in their right to do so - just as we believe in the right of Americans to express opinions on issues in other countries,” he wrote. Facebook is working with others in the tech sector, including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, on investigating alleged Russian election meddling, Schrage added. The 1,000 new workers represent the second time this year that Facebook has responded to a crisis by announcing a hiring spree. In May, it said it would hire 3,000 more people to speed up the removal of videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts that shocked users.  Like other companies that sell advertising space, Facebook publishes policies for what it allows, prohibiting ads that are violent, discriminate based on race or promote the sale of illegal drugs.  With more than 5 million paying advertisers, however, Facebook has difficulty enforcing all of its policies.  The company said on Monday that it would adjust its policies further “to prevent ads that use even more subtle expressions of violence.” It did not elaborate on what kind of material that would cover.  Facebook also said it would begin to require more thorough documentation from people who want to run ads about U.S. federal elections, demanding that they confirm their businesses or organizations.

2017-03-06,-13,"A copy of the court’s ruling, issued on Aug. 1 last year but only made public by Business Competence on Monday, said that Facebook launched its Nearby feature only months after Faround was included in the social network’s app store in 2012.  The complaint alleged that the two applications were “extremely similar” in their functions and general set-up. Facebook said it has discontinued offering what it now calls Nearby Places in Italy while it appeals against the court’s ruling. Facebook dropped what it called Places in 2011 but later revived similar features in Nearby, which also competes with products offered by Silicon Valley rivals Foursquare and Yelp. The court ordered Facebook to suspend Nearby Places in Italy or pay fines of 5,000 euros per day for copyright infringement and unfair competition. It said that Facebook may have to pay further damages to be determined at a later stage.  The ruling is preliminary and a further hearing is scheduled for April 4.  Facebook sought to have the order put on hold while it awaited a ruling on the merits of the case, but its request was rejected by the court in December. It said on Monday that it is complying with the decision pending its appeal. “We respectfully disagree with the decision. The claims were without merit,” a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement. “We believe the order was wrongly decided, but we have respectfully complied with the order in the interim.” Business Competence’s Faround app was launched in September 2012 and quickly gained popularity among Italian users. Faround was the most downloaded new social networking app in the country during the week of Nov. 22, 2012, according to data from App Annie, a business that measures online traffic. Downloads plunged the month after Facebook launched its own Nearby feature on Dec. 17 of that year. “It was a big blow to us to see that we were losing everything we had invested (into Faround),” Business Competence Chief Executive Sara Colnago told Reuters, adding that it had cost the company 500,000 euros ($530,050) to develop the app. "
2017-07-26,1,"Facebook, which now has more than 2 billion regular users, has been squeezing more ads into its Facebook News Feed while adding more ads to its photo-sharing app Instagram, which has more than 700 million users. With money cascading from those two services, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company was turning attention to monetizing its two messaging services, Messenger and WhatsApp, which have more than 1 billion users each. “I want to see us move a little faster here but I‘m confident that we’re going to get this right over the long term,” Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. The company also is accelerating its push into video, an effort aimed at taking advertising dollars from the television industry and increasing the time people spend on Facebook. Within weeks, Facebook is expected to start a video service that will include scripted shows, a sharp change for a business built on user-generated content.   Zuckerberg said video would be a significant driver of Facebook’s business in the next two to three years. With those possibilities still on the horizon, Facebook said  total revenue rose 44.8 percent to $9.32 billion in the second quarter of the year. That beat the average forecast of $9.20 billion among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Growth was even steeper in mobile advertising, which increased to nearly $8 billion. “In mobile we’re continuing to see great strengths,” Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a phone interview with Reuters. “We’re seeing more and more ad dollars getting allocated to mobile, and we think that trend will continue.” “KILLING IT ON MOBILE” “They’re killing it on mobile,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin said, referring to Facebook’s suite of apps. “They are the de facto mobile advertising monopolies and that’s a really big deal.” Martin said she sees no weaknesses in Facebook’s business. Facebook and Alphabet Inc own half of the online advertising market worldwide, and Facebook’s revenue growth this quarter outshone Alphabet, the owner of YouTube and Google.  Alphabet on Monday reported a 21 percent increase in quarterly revenue, although it started the quarter from a larger base than Facebook did. Facebook has not said how much of its revenue is attributable to its Instagram unit, although the photo-sharing app has become a greater focus of its business.  “Clearly, the biggest driver of growth is, overall, Facebook News Feed,” Wehner said. “Instagram is making a contribution and an increasing contribution.” But investors want Facebook to find additional revenue streams because the company has warned it is hitting maximum ad load in the News Feed, potentially slowing its overall growth.  So far that has not happened. “They kept warning about ad load, but the ad load continues to be strong,” said Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial Partners. “I still think ad revenue will grow, because more advertisers are adapting to this platform because there are so many people out there.” The popularity of Instagram also has put pressure on Snapchat, the app owned by Snap Inc. Instagram has added features similar to Snapchat’s and Snap’s stock on Wednesday closed at an all-time low of $13.40.  Facebook said about 2.01 billion people were using its service monthly as of June 30, up 17 percent from a year earlier. For the second quarter, net income attributable to shareholders rose to $3.89 billion, or $1.32 per share, from $2.28 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.13 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "
2017-06-27,1,"The user base is bigger than the population of any single country, and of six of the seven continents. It represents more than a quarter of the world’s 7.5 billion people.  Facebook defines a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through its website or a mobile device, or used its Messenger app, in the past 30 days. It does not include people who use the Instagram or WhatsApp networks but not Facebook. The company said in May that duplicate accounts, according to an estimate from last year, may have represented some 6 percent of its worldwide user base. The social network’s user population dwarfs that of similar companies. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) reported in April monthly active users of 328 million, while Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat had 166 million daily users at the end of the first quarter.  Facebook had 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. It reached 1 billion in October 2012.  The company, which Zuckerberg started in 2004 in his college dorm room, uses its huge size advantage to lure advertisers, offering them highly targeted marketing capabilities based on its data about users.  The number of advertisers topped 5 million in April, the company said. Facebook’s growth has increasingly come from outside the United States, Canada and Europe. Three years ago, those regions accounted for some 38 percent of users, compared with about 30 percent in the first quarter of this year.  To increase penetration rates in developing nations, Facebook has rolled out pared-down versions of its apps that use less data, and it has been developing solar-powered drones to extend internet connectivity around the planet.

As recently as June, Facebook told journalists that it had not found any evidence of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform. “TROLL FACTORY” CONNECTION Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called the Facebook report “deeply disturbing and yet fully consistent with the unclassified assessment of the intelligence community.” A Facebook employee said Wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive issue ads and a well-known Russian “troll factory” in St. Petersburg that publishes comments on social media. Ellen Weintraub, a member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said U.S. voters deserve to know where the ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal. “It is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state or local election, directly or indirectly,” Weintraub said in a phone interview.  She declined to comment on the Facebook ads, saying she could not discuss subjects that could come before the agency. Facebook declined to release the ads themselves, prompting a sharp rebuke on Twitter from Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of First Look Media, a producer of feature and documentary films, television and podcasts. “Facebook keeps the targeted political ads it publishes secret, emboldening criminals,” wrote Omidyar, the eBay founder who also provided funding to launch media organization The Intercept. “I don’t see how that can possibly be legal.” Facebook’s disclosure may be the first time a private entity has pointed to receiving Russian money related to U.S. elections, said Brendan Fischer, a program director at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency.  “Whoever may have provided assistance to Russia in buying these Facebook ads is very likely in violation of the law,” he said, adding that Facebook has a legal duty to act if it is aware of similar activity in the future.

2017-03-06,-13,"A copy of the court’s ruling, issued on Aug. 1 last year but only made public by Business Competence on Monday, said that Facebook launched its Nearby feature only months after Faround was included in the social network’s app store in 2012.  The complaint alleged that the two applications were “extremely similar” in their functions and general set-up. Facebook said it has discontinued offering what it now calls Nearby Places in Italy while it appeals against the court’s ruling. Facebook dropped what it called Places in 2011 but later revived similar features in Nearby, which also competes with products offered by Silicon Valley rivals Foursquare and Yelp. The court ordered Facebook to suspend Nearby Places in Italy or pay fines of 5,000 euros per day for copyright infringement and unfair competition. It said that Facebook may have to pay further damages to be determined at a later stage.  The ruling is preliminary and a further hearing is scheduled for April 4.  Facebook sought to have the order put on hold while it awaited a ruling on the merits of the case, but its request was rejected by the court in December. It said on Monday that it is complying with the decision pending its appeal. “We respectfully disagree with the decision. The claims were without merit,” a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement. “We believe the order was wrongly decided, but we have respectfully complied with the order in the interim.” Business Competence’s Faround app was launched in September 2012 and quickly gained popularity among Italian users. Faround was the most downloaded new social networking app in the country during the week of Nov. 22, 2012, according to data from App Annie, a business that measures online traffic. Downloads plunged the month after Facebook launched its own Nearby feature on Dec. 17 of that year. “It was a big blow to us to see that we were losing everything we had invested (into Faround),” Business Competence Chief Executive Sara Colnago told Reuters, adding that it had cost the company 500,000 euros ($530,050) to develop the app. "

2017-09-27,-9,"Trump appeared to embrace the focus on the social media network in his comments on Wednesday, which also took aim at more traditional medial outlets, long targeted by the president as “fake news.” “Facebook was always anti-Trump. The networks were always anti-Trump,” Trump said on Twitter, levelling the same charge against the New York Times and the Washington Post. “Collusion?” Representatives for Facebook and the newspapers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those investigating Russia’s role, said he expected to have the ads by next week and that they should be made public. “I have concerns about how long it took Facebook to realise the Russians were advertising on their network,” Schiff told MSNBC, adding that he has spoken several times with the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.  Facebook and other technology companies are coming under increased scrutiny amid the Russia investigations. The probes, being conducted by several congressional committees along with the Department of Justice, have clouded Trump’s tenure since taking office in January and threatened his agenda, which has yet to secure a major legislative victory.  Moscow has denied any collusion. Trump himself has previously praised Facebook and credited it with helping him win the November election. His campaign has said it spent some $70 million on Facebook ads, and it also ran  a live Facebook show.  His latest comments did not appear to affect shares of the company, which were up 1.4 percent at $166.50 a share in late morning trading after analysts raised their price target for the stock. "

2017-09-22,-13,"Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook that the company’s stock had performed well enough that he could fund his philanthropy by selling stock for at least 20 years and still retain voting control of the company. In December 2015 Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician, pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to charity.  According to court records, Zuckerberg owns more than 400 million shares of Facebook. That would value his holdings at a minimum of $68.2 billion, based on the company’s closing share on Friday of $170.54. Zuckerberg said he wanted to help solve global challenges “like curing all diseases in our children’s lifetime and personalizing education for every student.” Zuckerberg said that over about the next 18 months he planned to sell 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook, which at Friday’s closing price would raise $13 billion.  The decision came as Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, in a shareholder lawsuit seeking to halt the Class C stock plan, which had been approved by shareholders. Sjunde AP-Fonden, a Swedish national pension fund, and The Amalgamated Bank sued last year, saying that Zuckerberg should have to pay for the right to retain control while selling stock. ”We brought this case challenging a significant change in Facebook corporate governance, and by agreeing to abandon the reclassification we got everything we could have hoped to get,” said Lee Rudy of shareholder law firm Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check. Rudy said the Class C proposal was rejected by 80 percent of minority shareholders in a vote last year. Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of Facebook’s stockholder vote, which helped carry the proposal. Google, now Alphabet Inc, proposed a similar stock reclassification in 2012, and court records show that Facebook’s general counsel suggested Zuckerberg could use it as a model for Facebook.  Google settled with shareholders in a deal that included a $522 million dividend, payable under certain conditions. Withdrawing the share plan comes as Facebook faces pressure over advertisements on the social network and the role they may have played in last year’s U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump questioned on Friday the company’s decision to overhaul how it handles paid political ads amid investigations into alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections. "

Modamani’s image was subsequently shared on Facebook on anonymous accounts, alongside posts falsely claiming he was responsible for the Brussels Airport bombing of March 2016 and  setting on fire a homeless man in December last year by six migrants at an underground station in Berlin. The court rejected the need for a temporary injunction sought by Modamani to require Facebook to go beyond measures the company had taken to block defamatory images of him for Facebook users in Germany using geo-blocking technology. In a statement following the decision, Facebook expressed concern for Modamani’s predicament but said the court’s ruling showed the company acted quickly to block access to defamatory postings, once they had been reported by Modamani’s lawyer. After the ruling, Modamani’s lawyer in the case, Chan-jo Jun, told a news conference he was disappointed such imagery continued to circulate online and more must be done to force Facebook to delete hate-filled content on its own accord. Modamani’s complaint maintained that defamatory images based on the selfie posted to Facebook were still viewable online outside of Germany, or by users within German using a sophisticated Tor browser. But the court found that the risk of average German users seeing the illegal content was not sufficiently credible and therefore a temporary injunction was unnecessary at this stage. The ruling said there remained a legitimate issue over whether it was technically feasible for Facebook to do more to block such images, but this would require testimony by experts.  Tuesday’s decision is subject to appeal within one month of the yet-to-be-published written judgment, a court statement said.

2017-02-06,-7,"SAN FRANCISCO/ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Among Silicon Valley’s top tech employers, Facebook Inc (FB.O) could be the most vulnerable to U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected crackdown on guest-worker visas, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. More than 15 percent of Facebook’s U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) or Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft.  The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B “dependent” classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India’s Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find U.S. workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B” visa program. “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that  H-1B reform.

2017-07-19,-16,"Schrems’s lawsuit concerns alleged violations of privacy by Facebook through its use of personal data and tracking of users on external pages, among other things. Schrems argues it is vital that the case be treated as a class-action suit. He believes 25,000 individual lawsuits on user privacy would be “impossible” due to the financial burden on users and the inefficiency for judges. “If privacy claims cannot be grouped, they (Facebook) can get away with violating the law,” Schrems said in a statement. While common in the United States, class action suits are generally not recognized in Europe. Facebook calls the suit a way to get around that, brought by an activist so well-known he has merited an exhibit dedicated to his campaign against Facebook in Berlin’s Spy Museum. Schrems launched the lawsuit in August 2014 at his home court in Vienna against Facebook Ireland Ltd, the subsidiary offering the social network to more than 80 percent of active users worldwide.  Around 25,000 other Facebook users transferred their financial claims to him, forming an artificial class action suit, although legally the case remains between two parties. Firstly, it asked whether people lose the status of “consumer” when they publish books, deliver lectures, collect donations and operate websites. Secondly, in the event that Schrems could be considered a consumer, it asked whether it could hear the class action case when some of the consumers involved may not be based in Austria or even in the EU. Facebook argues that Schrems cannot be considered a “consumer”. He has spoken and written extensively on privacy law, and, according to Facebook, used the social media platform to further those professional activities - something Schrems denies. A Facebook spokesperson said: “Mr. Schrems’s claims have twice been rejected on the grounds that they cannot proceed as ‘class action’ on behalf of other consumers in Austrian courts. We were pleased to be able to present to the CJEU and look forward to resolving these claims.” European consumer group BEUC backed Schrems’s bid to have the case handled as a class action. “Consumers are often powerless when tech giants breach data protection rules,” said BEUC’s Christoph Schmon. “It makes sense to bundle multiple claims and avoid parallel procedures in different countries.” A court adviser, Advocate General Michal Bobek, is expected to issue his opinion on November 7, with the final judgment to come by the end of the year.

2017-04-27,-19,"These initiatives go much further than posting fake news stories to include amplification - essentially widening the circulation of posts through a variety of means - carried out by government employees or paid professionals, often using fake accounts. Reuters reviewed an advance copy of the 13-page report, which was written by two veteran security analysts who joined Facebook from cyber security firms FireEye Inc and Dell SecureWorks, along with Facebook’s chief security officer. (here) Facebook said its security team would now fight information operations, which it regards as a more complex problem than traditional hackers and scammers, by suspending or deleting false accounts after identifying them with a combination of machine learning and intelligence agency-level analysis. The new efforts build on the company’s recently expanded campaigns to identify fake news and crack down on automated profile pages that post commercial or political spam. Facebook suspended 30,000 accounts in France ahead of last Sunday’s first-round presidential election. In addressing the U.S. presidential election as a “case study,” the Facebook team said fake Facebook personas had spread stolen emails and other documents as part of a coordinated effort, which U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed to Russia. Other false personas pushed stories that expanded on that material. “From there, organic proliferation of the messaging and data through authentic peer groups and networks was inevitable,” Facebook said. It said its data “does not contradict” the U.S. director of national intelligence’s conclusion that Russia was behind efforts to interfere with the U.S. election. The report does not name any other countries. ‘FALSE AMPLIFICATION’  Facebook has faced pressure to clamp down on fake news, and has begun warning about suspected hoax stories. In its latest report, Facebook focused on how it will fight “false amplification” and targeted data collection, carried out through methods such as imposter accounts and password-collection schemes.   Facebook employees said the information operations it had seen included techniques such as carefully crafted friend requests sent under the appropriated names of real people. If those requests are accepted, the false friends can glean more information about the target. That information in turn can be used to send convincing web links leading to malicious software or to map the social networks of the targets for further spying. Facebook said it would go after amplifier accounts based on behavioral analysis that shows signs of inauthenticity, such as sudden bursts of activity or repeated posting of the same material, without regard to the politics of the content. Facebook said that other amplification techniques it had discovered include coordinated “likes” to boost the prominence of key postings, the creation of groups that camouflage propaganda by including legitimate items, and the spread of inflammatory and racist material. Most of the false amplification is driven by people with local language skills and a basic knowledge of the relevant political situation, the study said. Though the goals may often be to promote one cause or candidate or to denigrate another, another objective appears to be sowing distrust and confusion in general, the authors wrote. In some cases, they said, the same fake accounts engaged with both sides of an issue “with the apparent intent of increasing tensions between supporters.” Facebook’s new crackdown reflects a striking change in perspective from November, when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the argument that fake stories on Facebook could have influenced the U.S. presidential election “in any way” as “a pretty crazy idea.” "
2017-10-12,-17,"Axios asked Sandberg what the world’s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia’s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.  The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.  Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.  She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of  revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election. Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumors around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review. Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said. Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was “free from abuse” during any election in any country. “We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg said.  She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users. Sandberg said it was important to protect “free expression” on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site. She criticized Twitter’s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. “In that ad, there are a lot of things that people don’t like, that I don’t like. ... But the question is, ‘Should divisive political or issue ads run?’ Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,” she said. Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work toward making ad purchases more transparent, and she said  Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue. Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1. "
2017-05-03,-40,"The move is an acknowledgement by Facebook that it needs more than its recent focus on automated software to identify and remove such material. Artificial intelligence techniques would take “a period of years ... to really reach the quality level that we want,”  Zuckerberg told investors after the company’s earnings late on Wednesday. “Given the importance of this, how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we double down on this and make sure that we provide as safe of an experience for the community as we can,” he said.  The problem has become more pressing since the introduction last year of Facebook Live, a service that allows any of Facebook’s 1.9 billion monthly users to broadcast video, which has been marred by some violent scenes.  Some violence on Facebook is inevitable given its size, researchers say, but the company has been attacked for its slow response.  UK lawmakers this week accused social media companies including Facebook of doing a “shameful” job removing child abuse and other potentially illegal material. In Germany, the company has been under pressure to be quicker and more accurate in removing illegal hate speech and to clamp down on so-called fake news.  German lawmakers have threatened fines if the company cannot remove at least 70 percent of offending posts within 24 hours. So far, Facebook has avoided political fallout from U.S. lawmakers or any significant loss of the advertisers it depends on for revenue. Some in the ad industry have defended Facebook, citing the difficulty of policing material from its many users. Police agencies have said Facebook works well with them.  Facebook shares fell slightly on Wednesday, and edged lower still after the bell, following its quarterly earnings. Last week, a father in Thailand broadcast himself killing his daughter on Facebook Live, police said. After more than a day, and 370,000 views, Facebook removed the video. A video of a man shooting and killing another in Cleveland last month also shocked viewers. Zuckerberg said the company would do better: “We’re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner - whether that’s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.” The world’s largest social network has been turning to artificial intelligence to try to automate the process of finding pornography, violence and other potentially offensive material. In March, the company said it planned to use such technology to help spot users with suicidal tendencies and get them assistance. However, Facebook still relies largely on its users to report problematic material. It receives millions of reports from users each week, and like other large Silicon Valley companies, it relies on thousands of human monitors to review the reports.  “Despite industry claims to the contrary, I don’t know of any computational mechanism that can adequately, accurately, 100 percent do this work in lieu of humans. We’re just not there yet technologically,” said Sarah Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA who looks at content monitoring. The workers who monitor material generally work on contract in places such as India and the Philippines, and they face difficult working conditions because of the hours they spend making quick decisions while sifting through traumatic material, Roberts said in an interview. In December, two people who monitored graphic material for Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) services such as Skype sued the company, saying it had failed to warn them about the risks to their mental health. They are seeking compensation for medical costs, wages lost from disability and other damages.  Microsoft has disputed their claims. The company said in a statement that it takes seriously the responsibility to remove and report imagery of child sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as the health and resilience of employees.  Mental health assistance plans sometimes fall by the wayside for such workers, and there was a risk that would happen for Facebook if it tries to find 3,000 new workers quickly, Roberts said. “To do it at this scale and this magnitude, I question that,” she said.  When Facebook launched its live service in April 2016, Zuckerberg spoke about it as a place for “raw and visceral” communication.  “Because it’s live, there is no way it can be curated,” Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed News in an interview then. “And because of that it frees people up to be themselves. It’s live; it can’t possibly be perfectly planned out ahead of time.” Since then, at least 50 criminal or violent incidents have been broadcast over Facebook Live, including assault, murder and suicide, The Wall Street Journal reported in March. In January, four African-Americans in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled man on Facebook Live while making anti-white racial taunts. They have pleaded not guilty.  A man in Cleveland, Ohio, last month was accused of shooting another man on a sidewalk and then uploading a video of the murder to Facebook, where it remained for about two hours. The man later fatally shot himself.  Zuckerberg said the company would keep working with community groups and law enforcement, and that there have been instances when intervention has helped. “Just last week, we got a report that someone on Live was considering suicide,” he wrote in his post. “We immediately reached out to law enforcement, and they were able to prevent him from hurting himself. In other cases, we weren’t so fortunate.” "
2017-11-14,-7,"“A consumer who is entitled to sue his foreign contact partner in his own place of domicile, cannot invoke, at the same time as his own claims, claims on the same subject assigned by other consumers,” the EU top court’s Advocate General Michal Bobek said. The advocate general, whose opinions are not binding but usually followed by the court, said allowing a class action suit in this case would lead consumers to choose the place of the most favorable court. Privacy activist Schrems, who had argued that individual lawsuits on user privacy would be “impossible” due to the financial burden on users, said a ruling in line with the advocate general’s opinion would still allow him to set a precedent. “In the advocate general’s view, I can at least bring a ‘model case’ at my home jurisdiction in Vienna, which may enable us to debate the illegal practices of Facebook in an open court for the first time,” Schrems said in a statement. Facebook said the advocate general’s opinion supported the decision of two courts that Schrem’s claims could not proceed as a class action. While common in the United States, class action suits are rarely recognized in Europe. “It is not for the Court to create such collective redress in consumer matters, but eventually for the Union legislator,” the Advocate General said.

2017-06-04,-2,"May responded to the attack by calling for an overhaul of the strategy used to combat extremism, including a demand for greater international regulation of the internet, saying big internet companies were partly responsible for providing extreme ideology the space to develop. Facebook on Sunday said it condemned the London attacks. “We want Facebook to be a hostile environment for terrorists,” said Simon Milner, Director of Policy at Facebook in an emailed statement. May has previously put pressure on internet firms to take more responsibility for content posted on their services. Last month she pledged, if she wins an upcoming election, to create the power to make firms pay towards the cost of policing the internet with an industry-wide levy. Twitter also said it was working to tackle the spread of militant propaganda on its website. “Terrorist content has no place on Twitter,” Nick Pickles, UK head of public policy at Twitter, said in a statement, adding that in the second half of 2016 it had suspended nearly 400,000 accounts. “We continue to expand the use of technology as part of a systematic approach to removing this type of content.”  "

2017-04-28,-20,"On Monday, in an abandoned building in the Thai seaside resort of Phuket, 20-year-old Wuttisan Wongtalay turned on Facebook Live from his mobile phone. Then he picked up his 11-month-old daughter in her pink dress, tied a rope around her neck and hanged her. A second short video briefly shows her lifeless body. After that, he turned off the camera and killed himself. For the family of little Natalie Triratana, removing the videos was the last thing on their minds when they first popped up on Wuttisan’s Facebook feed at around 4.50 p.m. on Monday. Her mother’s cousin, Suksan Buachanit, said he called Thailand’s 191 police hotline to ask for help locating the building. By the time police and relatives found it, it was too late. “A local reporter told me to report it (to Facebook) but we were all occupied at the scene,” Suksan told Reuters in Phuket. It took more than a day - and 370,000 views - before Facebook removed those few minutes of video. Thailand’s digital ministry said even then it took five hours for the videos to be removed after the ministry contacted Facebook. A Facebook statement called the incident “appalling” and said there was “absolutely no place for content of this kind” on the network. It did not respond to Reuters questions as to why it took so long to remove the videos. In that incident, it took two hours to remove the video, bringing intense criticism on the social media giant and prompting it to promise “ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment”. [L4N1HZ3EO] It was unclear how many viewers alerted Facebook to the killing of the baby. Facebook did not respond to questions. But by the morning the baby’s murder had been reported in local media and was one of the most talked about stories in Thailand. Several local and international journalists told Reuters they had reported the videos to Facebook Tuesday morning and asked the company for comment. The head of Thailand’s police’s Technology Crime Suppression Division, Supachet Chokchai, said he was alerted to the baby murder videos by police in Phuket but he declined to say when that was. The division monitors online content ranging from anti-monarchy content to fraudulent websites. It also has a hotline for the public to call in tip-offs about offensive content. Nor would Supachet say when police then asked the digital ministry to get in touch with Facebook. The ministry said by the time police reported the videos on Tuesday afternoon it had already heard about them from an anonymous tip-off and had told Facebook. The ministry contacted Facebook through a “direct channel” at noon on Tuesday, according to Somsak Khaosuwan, the ministry’s deputy permanent secretary. He did not elaborate on what the direct channel was or say whom the ministry contacted at Facebook. It was only just after 5.00 p.m. - about five hours later and more than a full day after the videos were first streamed - that Facebook took them down. Police blamed the delay partly on the time difference between the United States, where Facebook is headquartered, and Thailand. They did not explain at exactly which stage the time difference had proved problematic, however. A spokesman for the police also said the force was tight on staffing. Thailand, along with other authoritarian governments in Asia, is more geared up to monitor politically sensitive content online. Censorship has been ramped up since a 2014 coup and hundreds of websites have been blocked or shut down for content deemed inappropriate or offensive.  Thailand is further tightening controls on internet users. This week, Thailand’s national telecoms regulator ordered all internet service providers to block web content deemed illegal by the courts within a week or face having their licenses revoked. Thailand is also working on a cyber security bill that would allow the state to conduct large-scale surveillance in the name of national security by wiretapping telephones and computers without the need for court approval.

2017-02-01,-2,"Mobile ad revenue accounted for 84 percent of company’s total advertising revenue of $8.63 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 80 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $8.31 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The strong results allay some concerns after the company warned in November that ad growth would likely slow “meaningfully” due to limits on “ad load” - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user. Facebook is expected to generate about $29.71 billion in  mobile ad revenue in 2017, according to research firm eMarketer, up about 35.2 percent from 2016. Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $1.56 billion, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.

2017-02-27,-22,"Last Thursday, video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc asked a Dallas federal judge to issue an order barring Facebook unit Oculus from using or distributing the disputed code, part of the software development kit that Oculus provides to outside companies creating games for its Rift VR headset. A decision is likely a few months away, but intellectual property lawyers said ZeniMax has a decent chance of getting the order, which would mean Facebook faces a tough choice between paying a possibly hefty settlement or fighting on at risk of jeopardizing its position in the sector. For now, Facebook is fighting on. Oculus spokeswoman Tera Randall said last Thursday the company would challenge a $500 million jury verdict on Feb. 1 against Oculus and its co-founders Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe for infringing ZeniMax’s copyrighted code and violating a non-disclosure agreement. Randall said Oculus would possibly file an appeal that would “allow us to put this litigation behind us.” She did not respond to a request for comment for this article. An injunction would require Oculus, which Facebook acquired  for $3 billion in 2014, to stop distributing the code to developers or selling those games that use it. Such a court order “would put a huge stumbling block in front” of Oculus, said Stephanie Llamas, an analyst with gaming market research firm SuperData. It would offer the company’s rivals in the new market, which include HTC, Sony Corp , Alphabet Inc and others an “important opportunity for them to become first movers.” Sales of the Rift itself would not be barred, but Llamas, said a lack of available titles could hinder Facebook’s offering relative to HTC’s Vive headset and Sony’s Playstation VR. That market is relatively small at the moment - sales of VR hardware and software totaled $2.7 billion in 2016 - and mainly limited to gaming. But Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has predicted the technology “will become a part of daily life for billions of people,” revolutionizing social media, entertainment and medicine. SuperData says the VR market will be worth $37 billion by 2020. Likewise, investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald last year issued a report predicting VR would account for 10 percent of Facebook revenue in four years’ time. ZeniMax’s lawsuit arose from 2012 correspondence between Luckey and famed video game developer John Carmack, creator of the Doom and Quake series and then a ZeniMax employee. Luckey signed a non-disclosure agreement with ZeniMax covering his  communications with Carmack. Carmack joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer. ZeniMax sued in 2014, claiming Carmack’s work while its employee was crucial to the Rift. At trial, Facebook said ZeniMax concocted its claims because of “sour grapes” over missing the VR trend. Zuckerberg testified that “the idea that Oculus products are based on someone else’s technology is just wrong.” The jury decided Oculus had not stolen trade secrets but had infringed ZeniMax’s intellectual property. It also said Oculus breached the non-disclosure agreement. IP lawyers said the judge would consider factors such as  whether ZeniMax continues to be harmed and whether money is sufficient compensation. Edward Naughton, a Boston-based copyright lawyer with Brown Rudnick, said ZeniMax has a strong argument because its technology continues to be used without its permission and the jury’s verdict does not compensate for that. “I think they have a pretty good shot here,” Naughton said. Mitchell Shelowitz, a copyright lawyer in New York, noted that the non-disclosure agreement explicitly stated ZeniMax would be entitled to an injunction in the event its terms were violated. Not all lawyers agree ZeniMax has the stronger position. Chicago-based IP lawyer Joshua Rich said he thinks Facebook has a good chance to repel the injunction by arguing that ZeniMax is not being harmed by the sale of the Oculus products because it is not direct competitor. If Facebook can get past the injunction fight, the calculus could change, said Naughton. Facebook may believe it has strong arguments on appeal or, because it has so much cash on hand, it may hope to wear ZeniMax down to the point where it settles on favorable terms. “Facebook has deep pockets,” said Naughton. “That allows them to put their opponent into litigation fatigue.”"
2017-02-01,-3,"This year may prove to be different. Facebook hasn’t backed off its cautious stance on revenue. It also plans to spend aggressively on R&D, content for its growing video ambitions and marketing. Expenses are forecast to increase some 40 percent to 50 percent from last year’s $15.2 billion. Expectations for Snap, the parent of the disappearing-message and photo app, are lofty. The company run by Evan Spiegel was valued at about $25 billion, or about 25 times expected 2017 revenue of $1 billion, at its latest fundraising. That number will face a big test when Snap publicly files for its initial offering, a step that may come later this week. Facebook is currently trading at about 11 times this year’s sales forecast. Founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg noted that it has been five years since Facebook filed for its public debut. After a rocky start out of the gate, it overcame doubts it could shift from desktop to mobile. Shares are up nearly 250 percent since their debut. Even so, advertisers are eager for more options besides Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. Worries about Facebook’s influence on everything from buying decisions to how people vote could have a dampening effect down the line. For now though, the company has raised the bar to new heights for Snap."
2017-02-02,-6,"More than 15 percent of Facebook’s U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc or Microsoft Corp . That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft. The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B “dependent” classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India’s Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find U.S. workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average, barely above the $60,000 floor set by law for the H-1B program. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B” visa program. “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that  H-1B reform.

2017-02-01,-2,"The petition calls on Facebook to forego the service fee of some $85,000 on funds the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) had fundraised via Facebook, arguing all donations should serve their intended humanitarian purpose. The Washington D.C.-based charity, which provides medical care in Syria and neighboring countries, said it raised the money using Facebook’s online charitable giving tool.  It has yet to collect the funds, which will help residents in the Syrian city of Aleppo. A Facebook spokesman said it was the first time he had heard of such a petition, which demands that “fees not be charged ... in light of the dire circumstances in war-torn Syria.” “(The funds) would go a long way to address the medical needs of thousands of innocent men, women, and children,” it said. Facebook said the service fees were to cover costs. “Facebook’s goal is to create a platform for good that’s sustainable over the long term, and not to make a profit from our charitable giving tools,” he said by email. “We’re committed to building products that make it safe and easy for people to contribute to the causes they care about directly on Facebook.” The appeal for funds was launched by SAMS’s vice-president, Basel Termanini, a doctor living near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who said he could not believe his eyes when the fundraising page he set up on Facebook in December went viral. In just two days, $900,000 in donations streamed in as media coverage showed the evacuation of thousands of exhausted residents from Aleppo. “This was (about being at) the right place at the right moment,” said Termanini in a phone interview. “People were upset with all those images and they wanted to help,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One donor, Nasir Khatri, a 25-year-old medical student living in Richmond, Virginia, was troubled after realizing a percentage of the money he had donated would go to processing and administrative fees, he said. Non-profits using Facebook’s charitable giving tool, which allows them to raise money directly on the site, are charged 5 to 5.75 percent, the bulk of which goes to credit card and other payment-related costs, according to the company’s website. “The people who need it most is not necessarily a multi-billion dollar organization,” said Khatri in a telephone interview.      It is common practice for fundraising websites to take a cut of funds raised, said Rick Cohen, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based National Council of Nonprofits, a nationwide network. “I have not heard yet of a case of (fees) being waved,” he said. But Termanini said he remained hopeful Facebook would waive the charge when formally presented with the petition, most likely in coming weeks. “Our cost per patient is $8, so we’re talking about 10,000 people who could be treated,” he said. “This is a huge amount for us.” Syria’s six-year civil war has mobilized humanitarian groups who have rushed to aid victims of the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands and uprooted millions.

2017-10-24,-12,"“Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,” Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee. He asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed. “I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” wrote Collins. The committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7. The inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources. The issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations. Facebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election. In Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks. Last week, another member of parliament, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing “widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference”. Russia has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. "
2017-04-26,-17,"“In the future, we will discuss inappropriate online content, whether on Facebook or YouTube or Instagram, and how we can speed up taking this content down,” deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phatanacharoen told reporters. It was not immediately clear how authorities plan to speed things up. Police had asked the Ministry of Digital Economy to contact Facebook about removing the videos. The ministry in turn contacted Facebook on Tuesday and the videos were taken down at around 5 p.m. in Bangkok that day, nearly a day after they had been uploaded. Google said the video was also on Youtube and it was taken down within 15 minutes of being informed of it by the BBC. The videos, which drew nearly half a million views before they were taken down, sparked outrage among netizens and prompted questions about how Facebook’s reporting system works and how violent content can be flagged faster. The case is the latest in a string of violent crimes that have plagued Facebook despite making up a small percentage of videos. On Tuesday a Swedish court jailed three men for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook. Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of a man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down. “We did the best we could but there’s the time difference issue because Facebook is headquartered in San Francisco,” Kissana said, without elaborating.  He said Thai police currently have two ways of being alerted about disturbing content: monitoring by a dedicated technology crime suppression division or a tip-off from the public using police hotlines. A cousin of the baby’s mother told Reuters the family was too traumatized to think about removing the video from Facebook. “We didn’t think about removing the video because all we wanted to do at the time was find them [the father and baby] first,” said Suksan Buachanit, 29. Thailand’s digital ministry said it would review how it handles similar cases in the future. “We will take this as a lesson and come up with a solution ... but this is not something we can do immediately,” ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters. Police said the killing was the first in Thailand known to have been broadcast on Facebook. They said the crime was driven by jealousy because Wuttisan was afraid his wife would leave him for another man. Thailand’s health ministry said it records on average 1-2 suicide videos a month that are posted to social media, including YouTube and Facebook. Thailand has a technology crime suppression police division, which handles inappropriate content and computer crimes that are insulting to the monarchy. The country’s strict lese majeste law makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent. Each offence is punishable with a jail term of up to 15 years. Thailand has increased its use of the law since the royalist military seized power in 2014. "
2017-05-03,-4,"Facebook’s shares fell 2.4 percent in after-hours trading to $148.12. They had closed at an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday.  Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on a conference call after the company’s earnings announcement that ad revenue growth is expected to come down significantly over the rest of 2017, repeating prior company warnings that it is hitting a limit in “ad load,” or the number of ads it can squeeze onto users’ pages before upsetting them.  Wehner gave similar warnings about ad load in November and in February, although a slowdown has not materialized.  New products, such as ads that play in the middle of videos or appear on Facebook’s Messenger app, could fuel growth, but Wehner and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday those plans were still in early stages.  At the same time, the company said expenses would continue at a high level, growing 40 percent to 50 percent this year over 2016 levels and putting a squeeze on future profits. “As we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going to be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable to the community and to the company in the long term that are going to be net negative on our operating margin,” Wehner said.  Facebook’s spending contributed to the drop in share price after hours, said Josh Olson, an Edward Jones analyst.  “Investors were hoping for some indication that we would see some relief as the year progressed, and we still could. I think that expense guidance range, left unchanged, is probably what is weighing on shares,” Olson said.  The company caused brief confusion on Wall Street by only issuing numbers conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) without warning. Previously it also issued non-GAAP numbers, which it had said provided greater transparency and were closely watched by investors and analysts.   The company is expected to generate $31.94 billion in mobile ad revenue globally in 2017, up 42.1 percent from a year earlier, according to research firm eMarketer. That would give Facebook a 22.6 percent share of the worldwide mobile ad market, with archrival Google of Alphabet Inc projected to be the leader with a 35.1 percent share, according to eMarketer. Facebook continued its march toward the 2 billion user threshold, saying it had some 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31. That was up 17 percent from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected monthly active users of 1.91 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter from $1.73 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 85 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue of $7.86 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with about 82 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $7.68 billion, according to FactSet.  Earlier in the day, Zuckerberg said the company would add 3,000 people over the next year to monitor and remove murders, suicides and other inappropriate material from its network, which have become a threat to Facebook’s valuable public image.

2017-04-26,-19,"By Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Panarat Thepgumpanat BANGKOK, April 26 (Reuters) - Police in Thailand on Wednesday said they would discuss how to speed up taking down “inappropriate online content” after a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in a live video on Facebook. Two videos, which were available for nearly 24 hours before they were taken down, show Wuttisan Wongtalay hanging his daughter from a building on the southern Thai island of Phuket on Monday before he turned off the camera and killed himself. “In the future we will discuss inappropriate online content, whether on Facebook or YouTube or Instagram, and how we can speed up taking this content down,” deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phatanacharoen told reporters. It was not immediately clear how authorities plan to speed things up. Police had asked the Ministry of Digital Economy to contact Facebook about removing the videos. The ministry in turn contacted Facebook on Tuesday and the videos were taken down at around 5 p.m. in Bangkok that day, nearly a day after they had been uploaded. The videos, which drew nearly half a million views before they were taken down, sparked outrage among netizens and prompted questions about how Facebook’s reporting system works and how violent content can be flagged faster. The case is the latest in a string of violent crimes that have plagued Facebook despite making up a small percentage of videos. On Tuesday a Swedish court jailed three men for the rape of a woman that was broadcast live on Facebook. Last week, Facebook said it was reviewing how it monitored violent footage and other objectionable material after a posting of the fatal shooting of a man in Cleveland, Ohio was visible for two hours before being taken down. Kissana blamed the delay partly on the time difference between the United States, where Facebook is headquartered, and Thailand. “We did the best we could but there’s the time difference issue because Facebook is headquartered in San Francisco,” Kissana said, without elaborating. He said Thai police currently have two ways of being alerted about disturbing content: monitoring by a dedicated technology crime suppression division or a tip-off from the public using police hotlines. A cousin of the baby’s mother told Reuters the family was too traumatised to think about removing the video from Facebook. “We didn’t think about removing the video because all we wanted to do at the time was find them [the father and baby] first,” said Suksan Buachanit, 29. Thailand’s digital ministry said it would review how it handles similar cases in the future. “We will take this as a lesson and come up with a solution ... but this is not something we can do immediately,” ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters. Police said the killing was the first in Thailand known to have been broadcast on Facebook. They said the crime was driven by jealousy because Wuttisan was afraid his wife would leave him for another man. Thailand’s health ministry said it records on average 1-2 suicide videos a month that are posted to social media, including YouTube and Facebook. Thailand has a technology crime suppression police division which handles inappropriate content and computer crimes that are insulting to the monarchy. The country’s strict lese-majeste law makes it a crime to defame, insult or threaten the king, queen, heir to the throne or regent. Each offence is punishable with a jail term of up to 15 years. Thailand has increased its use of the law since the royalist military seized power in 2014.

2017-02-27,-21,"A decision is likely a few months away, but intellectual property lawyers said ZeniMax has a decent chance of getting the order, which would mean Facebook faces a tough choice between paying a possibly hefty settlement or fighting on at risk of jeopardizing its position in the sector. For now, Facebook is fighting on. Oculus spokeswoman Tera Randall said last Thursday the company would challenge a $500 million jury verdict on Feb. 1 against Oculus and its co-founders Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe for infringing ZeniMax’s copyrighted code and violating a non-disclosure agreement. Randall said Oculus would possibly file an appeal that would “allow us to put this litigation behind us.” She did not respond to a request for comment for this article. An injunction would require Oculus, which Facebook acquired  for $3 billion in 2014, to stop distributing the code to developers or selling those games that use it. Such a court order “would put a huge stumbling block in front” of Oculus, said Stephanie Llamas, an analyst with gaming market research firm SuperData. It would offer the company’s rivals in the new market, which include HTC, Sony Corp, Alphabet Inc and others an “important opportunity for them to become first movers.” Sales of the Rift itself would not be barred, but Llamas, said a lack of available titles could hinder Facebook’s offering relative to HTC’s Vive headset and Sony’s Playstation VR.  That market is relatively small at the moment - sales of VR hardware and software totaled $2.7 billion in 2016 - and mainly limited to gaming. But Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has predicted the technology “will become a part of daily life for billions of people,” revolutionizing social media, entertainment and medicine. SuperData says the VR market will be worth $37 billion by 2020. Likewise, investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald last year issued a report predicting VR would account for 10 percent of Facebook revenue in four years’ time.   ZeniMax’s lawsuit arose from 2012 correspondence between Luckey and famed video game developer John Carmack, creator of the Doom and Quake series and then a ZeniMax employee. Luckey signed a non-disclosure agreement with ZeniMax covering his  communications with Carmack.  Carmack joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer. ZeniMax sued in 2014, claiming Carmack’s work while its employee was crucial to the Rift. At trial, Facebook said ZeniMax concocted its claims because of “sour grapes” over missing the VR trend.  Zuckerberg testified that “the idea that Oculus products are based on someone else’s technology is just wrong.” The jury decided Oculus had not stolen trade secrets but had infringed ZeniMax’s intellectual property. It also said Oculus breached the non-disclosure agreement. IP lawyers said the judge would consider factors such as  whether ZeniMax continues to be harmed and whether money is sufficient compensation.   Edward Naughton, a Boston-based copyright lawyer with Brown Rudnick, said ZeniMax has a strong argument because its technology continues to be used without its permission and the jury’s verdict does not compensate for that. “I think they have a pretty good shot here,” Naughton said. Mitchell Shelowitz, a copyright lawyer in New York, noted that the non-disclosure agreement explicitly stated ZeniMax would be entitled to an injunction in the event its terms were violated.  Not all lawyers agree ZeniMax has the stronger position. Chicago-based IP lawyer Joshua Rich said he thinks Facebook has a good chance to repel the injunction by arguing that ZeniMax is not being harmed by the sale of the Oculus products because it is not direct competitor.  If Facebook can get past the injunction fight, the calculus could change, said Naughton. Facebook may believe it has strong arguments on appeal or, because it has so much cash on hand, it may hope to wear ZeniMax down to the point where it settles on favorable terms. “Facebook has deep pockets,” said Naughton. “That allows them to put their opponent into litigation fatigue.” "

2017-05-04,-4,"Facebook’s shares fell 2.4 percent in after-hours trading to $148.12. They had closed at an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday.  Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on a conference call after the company’s earnings announcement that ad revenue growth is expected to come down significantly over the rest of 2017, repeating prior company warnings that it is hitting a limit in “ad load,” or the number of ads it can squeeze onto users’ pages before upsetting them.  Wehner gave similar warnings about ad load in November and in February, although a slowdown has not materialized.  New products, such as ads that play in the middle of videos or appear on Facebook’s Messenger app, could fuel growth, but Wehner and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday those plans were still in early stages.  At the same time, the company said expenses would continue at a high level, growing 40 percent to 50 percent this year over 2016 levels and putting a squeeze on future profits. “As we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going to be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable to the community and to the company in the long term that are going to be net negative on our operating margin,” Wehner said.  Facebook’s spending contributed to the drop in share price after hours, said Josh Olson, an Edward Jones analyst.  “Investors were hoping for some indication that we would see some relief as the year progressed, and we still could. I think that expense guidance range, left unchanged, is probably what is weighing on shares,” Olson said.  The company caused brief confusion on Wall Street by only issuing numbers conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) without warning. Previously it also issued non-GAAP numbers, which it had said provided greater transparency and were closely watched by investors and analysts.   The company is expected to generate $31.94 billion in mobile ad revenue globally in 2017, up 42.1 percent from a year earlier, according to research firm eMarketer. That would give Facebook a 22.6 percent share of the worldwide mobile ad market, with archrival Google of Alphabet Inc projected to be the leader with a 35.1 percent share, according to eMarketer. Facebook continued its march toward the 2 billion user threshold, saying it had some 1.94 billion people using its service monthly as of March 31. That was up 17 percent from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected monthly active users of 1.91 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter from $1.73 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 85 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue of $7.86 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with about 82 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected total ad revenue of $7.68 billion, according to FactSet.  Earlier in the day, Zuckerberg said the company would add 3,000 people over the next year to monitor and remove murders, suicides and other inappropriate material from its network, which have become a threat to Facebook’s valuable public image.

2017-02-23,-20,"ZeniMax made its request for an injunction in papers filed on Thursday in federal court in Dallas. It was the same court where jurors on Feb. 1 issued the verdict against Oculus and its founders Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe. Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company was continuing with its plan to ask the judge to set aside the verdict, which she called “legally flawed and factually unwarranted.” Lawyers for ZeniMax declined to comment. If granted, the injunction could limit the number of games available for sale for Oculus’ Rift VR headset. Such a move would be a blow to a product still in its infancy and on which Facebook has made a big bet for the future. Oculus has already made the disputed code available to companies that develop games, and it is embedded in many of the games available for use on the Rift, as well as Samsung Electronics Co’s Gear VR, a smartphone-compatible device developed through a partnership with Oculus. Mark Romeo, an Irvine, California-based intellectual property lawyer not involved in the case, said the potential disruption from an injunction, if granted, would put an “incredible amount of pressure on Facebook to enter into some sort of settlement.” The litigation stemmed from Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey’s 2012 correspondence with video game designer John Carmack, well-known for creating the Doom series. Carmack, who at the time was employed by a ZeniMax subsidiary, subsequently agreed to help develop software for the Rift. In 2013 he left ZeniMax and joined Oculus as its chief technology officer. ZeniMax sued Oculus in 2014, less than two months after Facebook paid $3 billion for the start-up, claiming Carmack  developed crucial Rift technology while he was a ZeniMax employee. ZeniMax also argued that Luckey breached a non-disclosure agreement. The case culminated in a three-week trial in which ZeniMax sought $6 billion in damages. Jurors rejected a claim by ZeniMax that its trade secrets were stolen, but it found that Oculus used the copyrighted code without permission and violated the non-disclosure agreement."

2017-01-24,-5,"“This rape was broadcasted live in a Facebook group,” police said in a statement.  Several viewers of the live broadcast reported the rape, according to the statement. Police swooped on an apartment in the city and detained three men born between 1992 and 1998. They also found a woman. The alleged victim was born in 1986, police said. The broadcast is the latest graphic video to bring into focus the complex ethical and policy issues faced by Facebook Live and others. Facebook live allows anyone to broadcast a video directly from their smartphone. But while traditional TV broadcasters are subject to regulations, internet streaming services do not face the same restrictions and enforce their own terms of service. Local media reported that the video had been removed and police were appealing for anyone who has a copy of the film to hand it over. On its website, Facebook says it will “remove content, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.”  (corrects year of birth of victim to 1986) "

2017-02-06,-7,"SAN FRANCISCO/ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Among Silicon Valley’s top tech employers, Facebook Inc (FB.O) could be the most vulnerable to U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected crackdown on guest-worker visas, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. More than 15 percent of Facebook’s U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, giving the social media leader a legal classification as a H-1B “dependent” company. That is a higher proportion than Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) or Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  That could cause problems for Facebook if Trump or Congress decide to make the H-1B program more restrictive, as the president and some Republican lawmakers have threatened to do. Both Trump and Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions have opposed the program in its current form. They have also indicated that they are open to reforming it to “ensure the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest,” according to a draft executive order seen by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft.  The Trump administration has not proposed any new rules that would target companies with the H-1B “dependent” classification. But the fact that Facebook alone among major tech companies falls into that category suggests it is the most exposed in the industry to any changes in H-1B visa policy. Facebook declined to comment on the matter. Trump administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday that Trump would target H-1B visas as part of a larger immigration reform effort through executive orders and Congressional action, but gave no details. H-1B visas are intended for foreign nationals in “specialty” occupations that generally require higher education, which according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) includes, but is not limited to, scientists, engineers or computer programmers. The government awards 85,000 every year, chiefly through a lottery system. Companies say they use them to recruit top talent. But a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics that those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications. H-1B dependent status is mostly held by these outsourcing firms such as India’s Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys. The status was introduced in the late 1990s in an effort to ensure that companies did not use the visas to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The status requires companies to prove they cannot find U.S. workers for the jobs. Facebook listed itself as a dependent company in its applications for H-1B visas with the Labor Department last year. Before he took office as president, Trump discussed changes to the H-1B visa program with top technology executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Those changes included possibly ending the lottery and replacing it with a system that would award the visas to the highest-paying jobs first, a move designed to reduce their issuance to outsourcing firms. Such a move could soften the blow from any H-1B changes for Facebook and other major technology companies. The average salary offered for Facebook H-1B jobs was $145,550, according to its application filings last year. Tata, a traditional outsourcing firm, offered $67,950 on average. The draft executive order did not mention specifics about the lottery. It did require the U.S. secretary of labor to provide the president with a report on “the actual or potential injury to U.S. workers caused, directly or indirectly, by work performed by nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B” visa program. “We are hoping that the final draft will have more details,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, a group that represents U.S. engineers and favors that  H-1B reform.

2017-01-19,4,"Facebook already has a data center in Lulea, Sweden and another in Clonee in Ireland. The new facility will be built on the outskirts of Denmark’s third largest city, best known as the birthplace of fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen. It will be powered exclusively by renewable energy, McEntegart said, adding that the cold climate could help to cool servers instead of relying on air conditioners.    McEntegart told local newspaper Fyens.dk that the center would cost more than $100 million but would not be more specific. It would provide 150 jobs when operational, he said.     Facebook bought a 0.5 square kilometer plot of land on the outskirts of Odense in October last year, but had not disclosed the purpose of the site. Danish Energy Minister Lars Lilleholt said Facebook’s decision was a recognition of Denmark’s strengths. ”We have one of the world’s greatest energy systems with large quantities of green energy, high security of supply, good fiber connections and competitive power prices,’ Lilleholt said in a statement.  Apple also invested in a data center in northern Denmark in 2015.  The Facebook center, expected to be operational in 2020, will consist of two large data buildings, a building for administration and logistics as well as several other technical facilities, according to Fyens.dk.

2017-02-16,-15,"The issue of data privacy came to the fore after revelations in 2013 from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance caused political outrage in Europe  Facebook says the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3 percent. Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook as its European headquarters are in Dublin, found in May that a complaint about privacy protections in mechanisms Facebook uses to transfer data were “well-founded.” It is asking the Irish High Court to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which would then decide whether to ban the use of “model contracts” - common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the 28-nation bloc.  A lawyer representing Facebook told the High Court that the case by the Irish regulator was flawed because it did not take into account the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement that came into force last August to address earlier concerns about U.S. surveillance.  Under the agreement, the replacement for the Safe Harbour agreement struck down by the CJEU in 2015, the United States agreed to limit the collection of and access to Europeans’ data stored on U.S. servers.  “How could you have a well founded concern about the protections that are available without having looked at it (privacy shield),” Paul Gallagher, representing Facebook, told the High Court.  “There should be no reference because the (Data Protection Commisioner‘s) decision has been overtaken by events,” he said. “The decision is deeply flawed.” Gallagher said that the level of transparency and the variety of protections in the United states “match anything in Europe” and said the court had not heard expert arguments on the quality of U.S. privacy protections.  The Irish commissioner’s office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook’s handling of his data in the United States.  Schrems and other privacy campaigners contend that alternative arrangements such as model clauses don’t offer Europeans any means of redress either. A lawyer representing Schrems, James Doherty, told the court that a referral to the European Court was “unnecessary or at least premature” as the Irish regulator had not fully investigated the complaint and had not used all tools in its power to restrict data flows where consumers’ rights were threatened.

2017-01-16,-15,"* ‘Fake news’, ‘hate speech’ issues heat up in election year * COO Sandberg in Berlin for talks with officials By Caroline Copley and Eric Auchard BERLIN/MUNICH, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Facebook is stepping up efforts to head off tougher regulation by Germany, a fierce critic of the social media network operator, saying on Monday it would do more to combat fake news as its chief operating officer met with officials in Berlin. Top German lawmakers are planning legislation this year to force Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its web pages within 24 hours or face fines, a push that could force the social media giant to bear more responsibility for content posted by users. Chancellor Angel Merkel, who is running for a fourth term this year, has warned that the Internet is not “a space that is free from the law”. Germany’s strict libel and slander laws are meant to protect citizens by making it a crime to defame others. More than 218,000 cases involving insults were filed with prosecutors in 2015. But few Internet based cases were prosecuted. Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg visited Berlin on Sunday to meet with German government officials considering new regulations on Facebook, according to a Berlin-based source at a rival Internet company. Dan Rose, who is in charge of partnerships for Facebook, on Monday acknowledged that it was no longer a simple communications platform. “There is no question we play an important role in the media landscape,” Rose told the DLD technology conference in Munich. “There are people who are discovering their news and consuming their video and other media types on Facebook ... We take that role seriously.” The issue has taken on more urgency amid concern by Germany’s political establishment that a proliferation of fake news and racist content, particularly about the 900,000 refugees that arrived here last year, could sway public opinion in the election campaign. Facebook on Sunday announced a partnership with German third-party fact-checking organisation Correctiv, promising to update its social media platforms in Germany “within weeks” to reduce the dissemination of fake news. Rose said it aimed to expand that model to other countries. Analysts expect Facebook to have generated $27.3 billion in revenue last year, more than 43 percent of which is set to fall to the bottom line as net profit. But measures that would legally oblige such social media platforms to set up “complaints offices” and plough more resources into deleting hate posts or fake news would chip away at that profit. A year ago Germany got Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube to sign up to a code of conduct, which included a pledge to delete hate speech from their websites within 24 hours. A similar voluntary code was adopted by the European Union in May. A September report by a group that monitors hate speech said it found Facebook deleted about 46 percent of illegal content reported by users in Germany within 24 hours, more than the 10 percent and 1 percent removed by YouTube and Twitter respectively. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas wants that rate to be increased to 70 percent. “A company that earns billions from the Internet also has a social responsibility,” he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper last month. Social networks such as Facebook are concerned that if they actively search for illegal content such as child pornography or incitement to terrorism, they could be deemed legally liable for such content. To combat that disincentive, the European Union is considering adopting a so-called ‘good Samaritan’ principle from the United States that would exempt platforms from liability in such cases, according to an EU Comission official. Senior conservative lawmaker Volker Kauder has said platforms should also provide information when requested about the identities of those posting fake news and hate speech. “They say there is too much (hate speech),” he said. “But a big auto manufacturer that produces millions of cars can’t say: ‘I produce so many cars that I can’t guarantee they are all secure.’ No, that is not on. I expect and demand from Facebook that laws are upheld.”   (Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg visited Berlin on Sunday to meet with German government officials considering new regulations on Facebook, according to a Berlin-based source at a rival Internet company. In an interview with Germany’s top-selling daily paper Bild published on Tuesday, she said Facebook could not single-handedly deal with hate speech and fake news posted on the network but had to work with third parties. Facebook on Sunday announced a partnership with German third-party fact-checking organization Correctiv, promising to update its social media platforms in Germany “within weeks” to reduce the dissemination of fake news. “We don’t want to decide what the truth is, and I don’t believe anyone wants us to do that,” said Sandberg, Facebook’s second-most powerful executive after founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. “When we say that we can’t take it on ourselves, that doesn’t mean that we don’t want to take any responsibility.

2017-01-17,0,"“Paris has always been a city of new ideas where people come together to break new ground, to do new things,” Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told reporters at the vast, listed former railway depot still under renovation. The 34,000-square meter site, a stone’s throw away from the river Seine, plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades, as well as 3-D printing labs and bars and restaurants open 24 hours a day. Niel, who founded France’s Iliad telecom company, invested 250 million euros ($268 million) in the project and expects to break even within three years. It is Facebook’s second major investment in Paris after it opened its only European artificial intelligence research lab in the city in 2015. A vibrant French technology scene - with emerging global champions such as BlaBlaCar and Sigfox - is one of the ruling Socialist government’s rare success stories on the economic front.  A generous research and development tax credit, an active public investment bank and a large pool of engineers have helped boost the French tech sector, keeping Paris hot on the heels of other major European tech hubs such as London and Berlin. French start-ups, however, have so far struggled to reach a critical size or remain independent. Some such as online advertising firm Criteo have decided to list in the United States while others were snapped up by large multinationals, connected objects maker Withings’s acquisition by Nokia being the latest example.

Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon has formed the view that some of the complaints against the model contracts are “well founded,” Michael Collins, a lawyer for the commissioner told Ireland’s High Court on Tuesday. “If you share her doubts - it doesn’t mean you have to be finally satisfied - then you must make a reference to the European Court... The Commissioner’s concern is simply to get it right, not to advocate for any particular result.” Collins said only the CJEU and not a national court or the Data Protection Commissioner has the jurisdiction to rule a European Commission decision invalid. He said that under EU law, a transfer of data can only be made to a country outside the EU if that country ensures an adequate level of protection.

2017-02-01,-11,"The jury in federal court in Dallas found Oculus, which Facebook acquired for about $2 billion in 2014, used ZeniMax’s computer code to launch the Rift virtual-reality headset. ZeniMax alleges that video game designer John Carmack developed core parts of the Rift’s technology while working at a ZeniMax subsidiary. Oculus hired Carmack in 2013. Facebook’s stock was not impacted by the verdict. The company’s shares were up 3 percent in after-hours trading following the release of a fourth-quarter earnings report that beat expectations. ZeniMax Chief Executive Robert Altman hailed the verdict and said in a statement the company was considering seeking an order blocking Oculus and Facebook from using its code. It is unclear what impact that would have on the Rift’s market availability. Though the jury ruled that none of the defendants misappropriated ZeniMax’s trade secrets, it found Oculus’ use of computer code directly infringed on ZeniMax’s copyright. The jurors held Carmack and different Oculus co-founders Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe liable for forms of infringement. The jury also found Oculus liable for breaching a non-disclosure agreement Luckey signed with ZeniMax in 2012, when he began corresponding about virtual reality with Carmack. The two met on an online forum. Well-known for helping to conceive games such as “Quake” and “Doom,” Carmack worked for id Software LLC before that company was acquired by ZeniMax. He is now the chief technology officer at Oculus. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified last month during the three-week trial that none of ZeniMax’s proprietary code was incorporated into the Rift. Though the jury did not find Facebook directly liable, it would likely be on the hook for damages owed by its subsidiary, absent an agreement stating otherwise. In a statement, Oculus spokeswoman Emily Bauer noted the jury’s finding on trade secrets theft and said the company would appeal. “We’re obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today’s verdict, but we are undeterred,” she said. “Oculus products are built with Oculus technology.”"

2017-02-02,-4,"The company had warned in November that ad growth would likely slow “meaningfully” due to limits on ad load - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user. But there was little sign of that in the fourth quarter as total revenue soared to $8.81 billion from $5.84 billion a year ago. “I think the rate of growth will decline, but it will remain very high,” said analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. “They grew 57 percent in 2016, and our current model has ‘only’ 38 percent revenue growth in 2017. That’s still pretty impressive.”  Facebook suffered a slight setback just before the market close when a jury in Texas ordered Facebook, its virtual reality unit Oculus, and other defendants to pay a combined $500 million to ZeniMax Media Inc, a video game publisher, for violating a non-disclosure agreement. [nL1N1FM20U] But the company’s core business continued to power ahead as mobile advertising accelerated; it now accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, up from 80 percent a year ago. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a call on Wednesday that the company expects a major ramp-up in hiring and other spending during 2017 as it invests in video and other priorities. Zuckerberg said the focus would be on generating short-form, original videos, especially professionally created “episodic content” produced week-to-week. Users should come to Facebook “when they want to keep up-to-date on what’s going on with their favorite show or what’s going on with a public figure,” he said.  U.S. President Donald Trump used the service for that on Tuesday, when he broadcast his announcement of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Facebook Live.  Facebook’s strong performance could also throw a shadow on the expected Snap Inc initial public offering. Facebook competes with Snap chiefly through its Messenger service, and also with WhatsApp and Instagram.  Facebook has also been building new tools to stem the spread of fake news and partisan propaganda on the network, which emerged as a major issue in last year’s U.S. presidential election.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg played down the impact of U.S. election spending on the company’s finances. She compared it to the soccer World Cup or the Super Bowl and said it was not a “top 10 vertical” for the fourth quarter. “No one event is that big for our business,” she said. China apparently will not contribute to that growth any time soon, as Zuckerberg all but ruled out an imminent expansion in the world’s most populous country. “We’re only going to do this in a way that we’re comfortable with in the long term,” he told analysts, adding that there would be “no news at all in the near term.”  Mobile daily active users rose 23 percent to 1.15 billion, the company said. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s users access the network through mobile devices. Facebook is expected to generate about $29.71 billion in  mobile ad revenue in 2017, according to research firm eMarketer, up about 35.2 percent from 2016. Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders for the quarter rose to $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $1.56 billion, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  "

2017-02-21,-1,"For social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, live streaming sports is key to attracting people since sports is one of the few types of content that people still watch live.     “Facebook is aggressively going after sports content and they are now one of a number of competitors to traditional media outlets that are going after sports programming,” said sports media consultant Lee Berke. “It makes perfect sense that they would be going after name brand properties like the MLB.”      The companies were in advanced talks, according to one source. It was unclear which games MLB would live stream on Facebook. A representative for Facebook and MLB declined to comment.      The size of Facebook’s reach was a big reason Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] decided to use Facebook Live to live stream Mexican soccer matches in English, said Tonia O’Connor, chief commercial officer and president of content distribution at Univision.      Under that deal, Facebook will live stream 46 matches by Mexican soccer league Liga MX in 2017. Terms were not disclosed. Over the past few months, Facebook has live streamed global basketball and soccer matches and table tennis.     While Facebook is aggressively pursuing sports deals, Twitter has established a coveted relationship with the National Football League. But Facebook does not need the NFL to claim victory in live sports, Berke said.      “The scope of their audience is worldwide,” Berke said. “They have a range of audiences and sports loyalties they can appeal to.”  "
2017-01-23,-5,"“This rape was broadcasted live in a Facebook group,” police said in a statement.  Several viewers of the live broadcast reported the rape, according to the statement. Police swooped on an apartment in the city and detained three men born between 1992 and 1998. They also found a woman. The alleged victim was born in 1986, police said. The broadcast is the latest graphic video to bring into focus the complex ethical and policy issues faced by Facebook Live and others. Facebook live allows anyone to broadcast a video directly from their smartphone. But while traditional TV broadcasters are subject to regulations, internet streaming services do not face the same restrictions and enforce their own terms of service. Local media reported that the video had been removed and police were appealing for anyone who has a copy of the film to hand it over. On its website, Facebook says it will “remove content, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.”  (corrects year of birth of victim to 1986) "

The new facility will be built on the outskirts of Denmark’s third largest city, best known as the birthplace of fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen. It will be powered exclusively by renewable energy, McEntegart said, adding that the cold climate could help to cool servers instead of relying on air conditioners.    McEntegart told local newspaper Fyens.dk that the center would cost more than $100 million but would not be more specific. It would provide 150 jobs when operational, he said.     Facebook bought a 0.5 square kilometer plot of land on the outskirts of Odense in October last year, but had not disclosed the purpose of the site. Danish Energy Minister Lars Lilleholt said Facebook’s decision was a recognition of Denmark’s strengths. ”We have one of the world’s greatest energy systems with large quantities of green energy, high security of supply, good fiber connections and competitive power prices,’ Lilleholt said in a statement.  Apple also invested in a data center in northern Denmark in 2015.  The Facebook center, expected to be operational in 2020, will consist of two large data buildings, a building for administration and logistics as well as several other technical facilities, according to Fyens.dk.

They also recommended giving users a written justification when a post is removed, producing a public report that would include figures on content removals and the number of takedown requests submitted by law enforcement, and additional training on racial discrimination for content reviewers.

2017-01-18,-5,"A jury is hearing evidence in a civil lawsuit brought by videogame publisher ZeniMax Media Inc against Oculus in 2014, in the middle of the Facebook-Oculus deal. ZeniMax said that Oculus unlawfully used its intellectual property to develop the virtual-reality system that includes the Rift headset. During one heated exchange with ZeniMax lawyer Tony Sammi, Zuckerberg told a jury in the crowded courtroom that the technology was not even fully formed when Facebook bought it.  “Improving on that technology doesn’t make it yours,” Sammi countered. “If you steal my bike, paint it and put a bell on it, does that make it your bike?” Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit and striped tie rather than his typical T-shirt and jeans, answered, “no,” but then added: “The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else’s is just wrong.” The 32-year-old Facebook founder has spoken about virtual reality as an important part of the company’s future business, especially as the technology becomes less expensive and its uses clearer.  The Oculus acquisition was more expensive than the $2 billion price tag indicated, Zuckerberg said in court, describing $700 million spent to retain employees and $300 million in payouts for reaching milestones. Oculus originally wanted $4 billion, he said.  Sammi questioned whether Facebook knew what it was doing when it made the acquisition. Zuckerberg said the Oculus deal was done over a weekend in 2014, which Sammi said did not show sufficient due diligence. Zuckerberg said, though, in later testimony that Facebook researched Oculus for months. At the time, Zuckerberg testified, he was not aware of any theft claims against Oculus.  “It’s pretty common when you announce a big deal that people just come out of the woodwork and claim they own some part of the deal,” Zuckerberg said.  On the stand, he also gave details about Facebook’s $22 billion purchase of messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. While the deal was in progress, another company he did not identify made a last-minute bid that was higher, Zuckerberg said, but WhatsApp declined because of its good relationship with Facebook. The Oculus lawsuit, in the sixth day of a jury trial, relates in part to programmer John Carmack.  Well-known for helping to conceive games such as “Quake” and “Doom,” Carmack worked for id Software LLC before that company was acquired by ZeniMax. He is now the chief technology officer at Oculus.  Zuckerberg denied that Carmack has unfairly used computer code from his previous position. “There is no shared code in what we do,” he said.  Zuckerberg said he has been interested in virtual reality since he was a student, but thought it was decades away from happening before he encountered Oculus. He told jurors how he used virtual reality to capture his daughter’s first steps, so her grandparents could experience it later.  “We want to get closer to this kind of perfect representation, so you can capture a moment you had,” he said.  The case is ZeniMax Media Inc et al v. Oculus VR Inc et al, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, No. 3:14-cv-1849."

2017-02-23,-16,"Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company was continuing with its plan to ask the judge to set aside the verdict, which she called “legally flawed and factually unwarranted.” Lawyers for ZeniMax declined to comment. If granted, the injunction could limit the number of games available for sale for Oculus’ Rift VR headset. Such a move would be a blow to a product still in its infancy and on which Facebook has made a big bet for the future.  Mark Romeo, an Irvine, California-based intellectual property lawyer not involved in the case, said the potential disruption from an injunction, if granted, would put an “incredible amount of pressure on Facebook to enter into some sort of settlement.”  The litigation stemmed from Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey’s 2012 correspondence with video game designer John Carmack, well-known for creating the Doom series. Carmack, who at the time was employed by a ZeniMax subsidiary, subsequently agreed to help develop software for the Rift. In 2013 he left ZeniMax and joined Oculus as its chief technology officer.   ZeniMax sued Oculus in 2014, less than two months after Facebook paid $3 billion for the start-up, claiming Carmack  developed crucial Rift technology while he was a ZeniMax employee. ZeniMax also argued that Luckey breached a non-disclosure agreement.  The case culminated in a three-week trial in which ZeniMax sought $6 billion in damages. Jurors rejected a claim by ZeniMax that its trade secrets were stolen, but it found that Oculus used the copyrighted code without permission and violated the non-disclosure agreement. "

2017-01-17,-8,"Chancellor Angel Merkel, who is running for a fourth term this year, has warned that the Internet is not “a space that is free from the law”. Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg visited Berlin on Sunday to meet with German government officials considering new regulations on Facebook, according to a Berlin-based source at a rival Internet company. In an interview with Germany’s top-selling daily paper Bild published on Tuesday, she said Facebook could not single-handedly deal with hate speech and fake news posted on the network but had to work with third parties. Facebook on Sunday announced a partnership with German third-party fact-checking organization Correctiv, promising to update its social media platforms in Germany “within weeks” to reduce the dissemination of fake news. “We don’t want to decide what the truth is, and I don’t believe anyone wants us to do that,” said Sandberg, Facebook’s second-most powerful executive after founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. “When we say that we can’t take it on ourselves, that doesn’t mean that we don’t want to take any responsibility. We do take responsibility.” The issue has taken on more urgency amid concern by Germany’s political establishment that a proliferation of fake news and racist content, particularly about the 900,000 refugees that arrived here last year, could sway public opinion in the election campaign. Dan Rose, who is in charge of partnerships for Facebook, onMonday acknowledged that it was no longer a simple communications platform. “There is no question we play an important role in the media landscape,” Rose told the DLD technology conference in Munich. “There are people who are discovering their news and consuming their video and other media types on Facebook ... We take that role seriously.” Analysts expect Facebook to have generated $27.3 billion in revenue last year, more than 43 percent of which is set to fall to the bottom line as net profit. But measures that would legally oblige such social media platforms to set up “complaints offices” and plough more resources into deleting hate posts or fake news would chip away at that profit. A year ago Germany got Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube to sign up to a code of conduct, which included a pledge to delete hate speech from their websites within 24 hours. A similar voluntary code was adopted by the European Union in May.     A September report by a group that monitors hate speech said it found Facebook deleted about 46 percent of illegal content reported by users in Germany within 24 hours, more than the 10 percent and 1 percent removed by YouTube and Twitter respectively. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas wants that rate to be increased to 70 percent. “A company that earns billions from the Internet also has a social responsibility,” he told the Bild amSonntag newspaper last month.         Social networks such as Facebook are concerned that if they actively search for illegal content such as child pornography or incitement to terrorism, they could be deemed legally liable for such content.     To combat that disincentive, the European Union is considering adopting a so-called ‘good Samaritan’ principle from the United States that would exempt platforms from liability in such cases, according to an EU Commission official.     Senior conservative lawmaker Volker Kauder has said platforms should also provide information when requested about the identities of those posting fake news and hate speech.     “They say there is too much (hate speech),” he said. “But a big auto manufacturer that produces millions of cars can’t say: ‘I produce so many cars that I can’t guarantee they are all secure.’ No, that is not on. I expect and demand from Facebook that laws are upheld.” "

2016-12-21,0,"The agreement between Facebook’s Building 8 and the universities comes as the social media company seeks to find new revenue streams in virtual reality and artificial intelligence, after the company signaled last month it had begun to hit some advertising growth limits on its network of 1.8 billion monthly active users. Research partnerships between universities and companies typically take nine to 12 months to facilitate, but the new agreement will allow for collaboration on new ideas within weeks, said Regina Dugan, who joined the company in April to run the new Building 8 unit. Dugan did not provide specifics to explain how the partnership will promote a quicker pace of research, but traditional negotiations between universities and companies can often take several months. “When curiosity strikes, with this new agreement in place, Harvard researchers can initiate new projects with scientific colleagues at Facebook almost immediately,” Isaac Kohlberg, chief technology development officer at Harvard, said in a statement. “This agreement with Facebook recognizes that the most significant, transformative solutions will be informed by university science.” Participating universities will receive payment from Facebook, a company spokesman said, declining to specify how much Facebook would pay. Facebook has increasingly sought to find new revenue streams outside its traditional advertising model, but products such as its WhatsApp messaging app and Oculus Rift virtual reality headset currently generate little. Other participating universities include Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Johns Hopkins University, Northeastern University, Rice, University of California-Berkeley, University of California-San Francisco,  Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Arizona State University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Waterloo in Canada.

2016-12-20,-10,"However, the statement of objections sent to Facebook will not affect the EC’s approval of the $22 billion merger in 2014, the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Facebook becomes the latest Silicon Valley target of EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has demanded Apple pay back $14 billion in taxes to Ireland and hit Google with two market abuse investigations. The issue regards a WhatsApp privacy policy change in August when it said it would share some users’ phone numbers with parent company Facebook, triggering investigations by a number of EU data protection authorities. The Commission said Facebook had indicated in its notification of the planned acquisition that it would be unable reliably to match the two companies’ user accounts. “The Commission’s preliminary view is that Facebook gave us incorrect or misleading information during the investigation into its acquisition of WhatsApp,” said Vestager. The EU executive said it took the preliminary view that the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook users’ IDs with those of WhatsApp already existed in 2014 when Facebook sought EU approval for the merger. The Commission - which approved the transaction without conditions - said it did not only rely on the information about the possibility of matching user accounts when reviewing the deal. Facebook has until Jan. 31 to respond. If the Commission’s concerns are confirmed it can impose a fine on the U.S. company of up to 1 percent of turnover, or about $179 million based on 2015 revenues. Companies fined can appeal to the European Court of Justice, which has overturned some penalties in the past. ”We respect the Commission’s process and are confident that a full review of the facts will confirm Facebook has acted in good faith, a Facebook spokeswoman said. “We’ve consistently provided accurate information about our technical capabilities and plans, including in submissions about the WhatsApp acquisition and in voluntary briefings before WhatsApp’s privacy policy update this year,” she added. The company will continue to cooperate and give the information officials need to resolve their questions, she said. Facebook informed the Commission of the planned change in January.

2017-01-17,0,"“Paris has always been a city of new ideas where people come together to break new ground, to do new things,” Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told reporters at the vast, listed former railway depot still under renovation. The 34,000-square meter site, a stone’s throw away from the river Seine, plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades, as well as 3-D printing labs and bars and restaurants open 24 hours a day. Niel, who founded France’s Iliad telecom company, invested 250 million euros ($268 million) in the project and expects to break even within three years. It is Facebook’s second major investment in Paris after it opened its only European artificial intelligence research lab in the city in 2015. A vibrant French technology scene - with emerging global champions such as BlaBlaCar and Sigfox - is one of the ruling Socialist government’s rare success stories on the economic front.  A generous research and development tax credit, an active public investment bank and a large pool of engineers have helped boost the French tech sector, keeping Paris hot on the heels of other major European tech hubs such as London and Berlin. French start-ups, however, have so far struggled to reach a critical size or remain independent. Some such as online advertising firm Criteo have decided to list in the United States while others were snapped up by large multinationals, connected objects maker Withings’s acquisition by Nokia being the latest example.

2016-12-20,-9,"Facebook becomes the latest Silicon Valley target of EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has demanded Apple (AAPL.O) pay back $14 billion in taxes to Ireland and hit Google (GOOGL.O) with two market abuse investigations. The issue regards a WhatsApp privacy policy change in August when it said it would share some users’ phone numbers with parent company Facebook, triggering investigations by a number of EU data protection authorities. The Commission said Facebook had indicated in its notification of the planned acquisition that it would be unable reliably to match the two companies’ user accounts. “The Commission’s preliminary view is that Facebook gave us incorrect or misleading information during the investigation into its acquisition of WhatsApp,” said Vestager. The EU executive said it took the preliminary view that the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook users’ IDs with those of WhatsApp already existed in 2014 when Facebook sought EU approval for the merger. Facebook has until Jan. 31 to respond. If the Commission’s concerns are confirmed it can impose a fine on the U.S. company of up to 1 percent of turnover, or about $179 million based on 2015 revenues. Companies fined can appeal to the European Court of Justice, which has overturned some penalties in the past. ”We respect the Commission’s process and are confident that a full review of the facts will confirm Facebook has acted in good faith, a Facebook spokeswoman said. “We’ve consistently provided accurate information about our technical capabilities and plans, including in submissions about the WhatsApp acquisition and in voluntary briefings before WhatsApp’s privacy policy update this year,” she added. The company will continue to cooperate and give the information officials need to resolve their questions, she said. Facebook informed the Commission of the planned change in January. In response to separate concerns from EU data protection watchdogs Facebook has agreed to stop sharing WhatsApp users’ information with Facebook for the purposes of improving Facebook products and advertising experiences.

2017-04-18,5,"Wells Fargo’s chatbot will use artificial intelligence to respond to natural language messages from users, such as how much money they have in their accounts, and where the nearest bank ATM is. Chatbots have risen in popularity in finance and other industries over the past few months because recent improvements in artificial intelligence have made them better at interacting and interpreting human language. Banks and other financial firms are hopeful chatbots can be used to provide better and continuous customer service at the fraction of the cost of large call centers populated by humans. French bank Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), for example, recently revealed that it was working with startup Personetics Technologies to develop chatbots that could answer queries about equity funds in its Romanian banking unit.  Money transfer startup TransferWise in February launched a Facebook chatbot that enables customers to send money to friends and family internationally from Facebook Messenger. In March U.S. bank Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) launched a chatbot named “Eno”, which can answer questions on their recent account balances or help pay off credit card bills. Wells Fargo’s chatbot, which does not yet have a name, comes as the bank ramps up its development of artificial intelligence-based technology. In February it created a dedicated AI team to create technology, such as the new chatbot, that can help the bank provide more personalized customer service through its bankers and online.  “AI technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website, and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment,” said Steve Ellis, head of Wells Fargo’s Innovation Group, where the company’s AI team is based. Facebook opened up its Messenger app to developers to create chatbots in April 2016 in a bid to expand its reach in customer service and enterprise transactions. "

2017-02-12,-10,"“Two months after our meeting, they have done nothing. They have not even written to me about what I said. Good manners would have expected at least a reply,” Boldrini told Reuters in a gilded, art-filled room in the parliament building. She said she would write an open letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week reiterating her call for a more effective and timely policing of his site. “His platform risks becoming home to dangerous predators ... the company has to take responsibility for this,” she said.  In a statement, Facebook said it was committed to battling hate speech and fake news, and was working closely with various institutions in Italy to deal with cyber bullying. Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft agreed last May to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech,  pledging to review the majority of valid requests for removal of illegal abuse within 24 hours in Europe. However, in a report released in December, the European Commission said only 40 percent of hate speech was being reviewed within 24 hours, with wide variations from country to country. In Italy, just four percent of hate posts were being removed within a day, the report said. “Boldrini, you are a handicapped whore,” says one. “Why has no one killed this terrorist,” says another. Despite flagging such insults to senior Facebook managers, many still remained on her homepage, she said.  One of her requests was for Facebook to open a full office in Italy to deal with its 28 million users in the country. At present, Italian complaints are handled at the company’s European headquarters in Ireland, but Boldrini said the firm had not told her how many of its employees there spoke Italian. Boldrini, a former spokesperson for the United Nations Refugee Agency, said many of those who abused her on Facebook had been spurred on by malicious, fake news articles about her. These included stories about her saying migrants should get housing before locals, that Italian women should wear the veil or that her long-dead sister was making money from migration. “Fake news and hate go together. It is not being done as a joke. They are looking to discredit their adversaries. It is short-circuiting democracy,” she said. Boldrini last week launched a campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of false information, saying they raised a threat to ordinary people - such as lies spread deliberately about vaccinations for children or health scares. “Fake news is harming people and spreading hate. Hate is poisoning the well,” she said. "

Facebook said it would test a feature using Instant Articles to allow readers to see multiple stories at a time, as a package, from their preferred news organizations.     The company said it would work with third-party organizations to promote “news literacy” and help users decide which sources are trustworthy and would also continue to work on curbing hoaxes. Facebook faced criticism in the last couple of months that it did not do enough to tackle the problem of fake news stories on its platform during the U.S. presidential campaign. ""We care a great deal about making sure that a healthy news ecosystem and journalism can thrive,"" Fidji Simo, director of product at Facebook, said in a blog post.

2017-02-01,-4,"The company had warned in November that ad growth would likely slow “meaningfully” due to limits on ad load - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user. But there was little sign of that in the fourth quarter as total revenue soared to $8.81 billion from $5.84 billion a year ago. “I think the rate of growth will decline, but it will remain very high,” said analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. “They grew 57 percent in 2016, and our current model has ‘only’ 38 percent revenue growth in 2017. That’s still pretty impressive.”  Facebook suffered a slight setback just before the market close when a jury in Texas ordered Facebook, its virtual reality unit Oculus, and other defendants to pay a combined $500 million to ZeniMax Media Inc, a video game publisher, for violating a non-disclosure agreement. [nL1N1FM20U] But the company’s core business continued to power ahead as mobile advertising accelerated; it now accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, up from 80 percent a year ago. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a call on Wednesday that the company expects a major ramp-up in hiring and other spending during 2017 as it invests in video and other priorities. Zuckerberg said the focus would be on generating short-form, original videos, especially professionally created “episodic content” produced week-to-week. Users should come to Facebook “when they want to keep up-to-date on what’s going on with their favorite show or what’s going on with a public figure,” he said.  U.S. President Donald Trump used the service for that on Tuesday, when he broadcast his announcement of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Facebook Live.  Facebook’s strong performance could also throw a shadow on the expected Snap Inc initial public offering. Facebook competes with Snap chiefly through its Messenger service, and also with WhatsApp and Instagram.  Facebook has also been building new tools to stem the spread of fake news and partisan propaganda on the network, which emerged as a major issue in last year’s U.S. presidential election.  Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg played down the impact of U.S. election spending on the company’s finances. She compared it to the soccer World Cup or the Super Bowl and said it was not a “top 10 vertical” for the fourth quarter. “No one event is that big for our business,” she said. China apparently will not contribute to that growth any time soon, as Zuckerberg all but ruled out an imminent expansion in the world’s most populous country. “We’re only going to do this in a way that we’re comfortable with in the long term,” he told analysts, adding that there would be “no news at all in the near term.”  Mobile daily active users rose 23 percent to 1.15 billion, the company said. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s users access the network through mobile devices. Facebook is expected to generate about $29.71 billion in  mobile ad revenue in 2017, according to research firm eMarketer, up about 35.2 percent from 2016. Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders for the quarter rose to $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $1.56 billion, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  "

2017-09-26,-1,"“It is the museum’s own choice and they have their full right to do it, but I think it’s a shame,” said Inger Stojberg, minister for immigration and integration, in her Facebook post.  The Facebook post is accompanied by a screen shot of the minister’s iPad background screen, which shows a cartoon of a bearded man with a bomb in his turban. Stojberg said in the post she uses the cartoon as her background screen because it reminds her that Denmark is a country with freedom of speech, which includes the right to criticize religions. “Honestly, I think we should be proud of the Mohammad cartoons,” Stojberg said. Three Danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in 2006 in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, after drawings of the Prophet Mohammed, images many Muslims consider blasphemous, were published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.   The picture posted on Monday by the minister was one of those cartoons. "
2017-09-28,-12,"The leaders of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said the panel would hold an open hearing next month with representatives from unnamed technology companies in an effort to “better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.” Representatives for Facebook and Google confirmed they had received invitations from the Senate committee but did not say whether the companies would attend. Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The House panel did not immediately identify any companies, but a committee source said lawmakers expected to hear from the same three firms the Senate had asked to testify. The requests are the latest move by congressional investigators to gain information from internet companies as they probe the extent of Moscow’s alleged efforts to disrupt last year’s U.S. election. Lawmakers in both parties have grown increasingly concerned that social networks may have played a key role in Russia’s influence operation. Facebook revealed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that has prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads. On Wednesday, Trump attacked Facebook in a tweet and suggested the world’s largest social network had colluded with other media outlets that opposed him. The president has been skeptical of the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election and has denied his campaign colluded with Moscow. “That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page. Republican Senator James Lankford, who has received classified information about Russia’s interference as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the country’s attempts to sow discord in U.S. domestic affairs had not abated. Russian internet trolls over the weekend fueled the debate ignited by Trump over whether NFL players should have the right to kneel during the national anthem,  Lankford said. Also on Wednesday, the Daily Beast, citing unnamed sources, reported that a Facebook group named “United Muslims of America” was a fake account linked to the Russian government and that it was used to push false claims about U.S. politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  The group bought Facebook ads to reach targeted audiences, promoting political rallies aimed at Muslims, the website reported. The Senate and House intelligence committees are two of the main congressional panels probing allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the U.S. election to boost Trump’s chances at winning the White House, and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

2017-10-31,-8,"“In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,” Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads “reprehensible” for their political divisiveness. The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.  Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.  Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.  “I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.  Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.  The Russian government has denied it intended to influence  the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.   Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.  Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.  Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.  Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers. Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.  “You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.  The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.  Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”   Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.  The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a “patchwork” of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.  "

But taming the internet in a young, fast-growing country is not easy, especially when the companies providing the platform are global. China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. Vietnam is among Facebook’s top 10 countries, by number of members. It now reports more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, according to research provided to Reuters by social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Google’s YouTube and Twitter are popular too. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, social media underpins business and communications as well as government critics. Some dissidents posting on social media have been caught in a major crackdown that has followed changes in the ruling party hierarchy. At least 15 people have been arrested this year. High profile bloggers Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as “Mother Mushroom”, and Tran Thi Nga have been jailed for 10 and nine years respectively. Government critics also complain of beatings by unidentified assailants and intimidation. Several have more than 100,000 followers and at least one has over 400,000 - more than double that for the government’s own Facebook page and nearly a 10th the size of the Communist Party’s national membership. “We use any chance we have to raise our voice: environmental issues, territorial issues, land issues,” said ‘Anh Chi’, 43, a Vietnamese teacher, translator and publisher whose real name is Nguyen Chi Tuyen. Vietnam tried to pressure Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) to take down thousands items of anti-government content in March by leaning on advertisers, but the continued prevalence suggests limited success. One reason it is hard to take tougher action is business: From brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing Vietnam’s streets, social media is a key marketing route to young and increasingly affluent consumers in an economy growing at more than 6 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Asia. “You’ve got kids that are building businesses on these platforms and generating significant success,” said Simon Kemp, founder of the Kepios marketing consultancy. While it accounts for only a tiny part of Facebook or Google parent Alphabet’s revenue, Vietnam is a hot target for global consumer brands. Asia-Pacific was Facebook’s fastest growing region by revenue last year, up nearly 60 percent. Tighter Internet controls could dampen innovation and impact the growth of Vietnam’s digital economy and its competitiveness, said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. “China has had remarkable success controlling discussion,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.

Activist Pham Doan Trang noted on Facebook that some campaigners appeared to have withdrawn from the scene in the face of the crackdown, but said she would not be discouraged. “Freedom has a very funny rule,” she told Reuters “Once people know the limit of freedom they will never go back.” "

2017-11-08,-2,"Getting revenge on throngs of short-sellers can’t have been the only reason. It’s also helpful for Snap to let rivals like Facebook know it has a new deep-pocketed backer. Worth some $469 billion, Tencent is a more formidable force than Snap, whose shares are trading below the price at which they debuted in March. Snap also said it “looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences” with the Shenzhen-based company, which has found creative ways with payments and games to keep nearly one billion users glued to WeChat. Tencent has been slowly striking U.S. allegiances, including with Tesla, as it plots global expansion. It also has a vested interest in making sure that Facebook, which freely copies Snapchat features and rolls them out on its own apps, has some stiff competition on its home turf. And while there are no clear signs that Beijing intends to give Mark Zuckerberg’s powerhouse an entry visa, if it happened it would pose a competitive threat. Facebook is trying to crack China’s massive market, where it has been banned for years. It quietly released a photo-sharing app in the People’s Republic called Colorful Balloons, according to the New York Times, and has been scouting for office space in Shanghai. Zuckerberg, who has been studying Mandarin, was in the country just last month. And if Facebook isn’t going away, Tencent has incentives to make sure Snap doesn’t either."

He is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, which each carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and identity theft, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years. The alleged scheme is an example of a growing type of fraud called “business email compromise,” in which fraudsters ask for money using emails targeted at companies that work with foreign suppliers or regularly make wire transfers.

2017-06-02,-10,"On June 3, 2015, Sandberg published on Facebook an account of the emotional aftermath. Over more than 1,700 words, she wrestled with her sorrow and her young children’s pain, while admitting her own mother stayed with her each night as she sobbed herself to sleep. “I have learned that I never really knew what to say to others in need,” she wrote. “Option B” is an expansion of the original post that draws upon Sandberg’s personal diaries of her loss. Co-written with Adam Grant, a psychologist and Wharton professor, it’s also peppered with anecdotes of others’ experiences of war, rape and illness, and how each person dealt with the adversity. There are important data points, too. The death of a partner can be particularly harsh for women who can suddenly find themselves strapped financially. The wage gap, a big theme in Sandberg’s prior book, makes that even worse. Bereavement leave is meager for most people in the workforce. In one concrete response, Facebook has increased the time off it allows to 20 days, sparking interest from other companies. The most surprising aspect of the book, however, is Sandberg’s openness. This is a woman who graduated from Harvard and its business school, worked at the World Bank, served as chief of staff to U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, became an executive at Google, and now heads operations for a company that rakes in $28 billion in annual revenue. To read that she “worried incessantly that I was a huge burden to everyone and yet depended on their support,” or that her biggest fear is that her son and daughter will never have a happy childhood, is startling in its honesty. Few in the top echelons of corporate America would expose themselves in this way. Then again, Sandberg works at the world’s largest social-media company, where sharing is encouraged because it is the source of profit. “Option B” and the networks born out of the book serve as a model for how Facebook might want its 2 billion users to see it as a platform to build “collective resilience.” This is not to say that “Option B” is an exercise in corporate boosterism. Far from it. Sandberg was both praised and faulted for “Lean In.” Many pointed out that her affluence allowed her to assert herself in her jobs while also being a mother, a luxury not available to most people. There is much less room to criticize the message in her latest book. Grief is a great equalizer. All the same, this is a pivotal moment for Facebook. Its success relies on the network effect, the idea that the more people who use it, the stronger it becomes. The company’s news feed is already among the top destinations for digital advertisers because of the size of its audience and the fact people linger. Facebook and Alphabet’s Google hold almost 50 percent of the world market. Since September, though, the firm founded by Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed five different errors in the metrics reported to advertisers. Slow responses to complaints about violent content that included a brutal murder and a suicide are worrisome, too. Zuckerberg has never been skilled at engaging emotionally. It took him months to acknowledge Facebook’s powerful role sifting U.S. election news. His current tour across America, complete with postcard-like posts, is baffling. Sandberg, however, brings real heart to her own loss and in the process lends some empathy to Facebook, too. It’s surely not what “Option B” was meant to achieve, but the book has set her up as the company’s No. 1 diplomat."
2017-07-09,2,"The Sunday Times reported that American investment firm Iconiq Capital had held talks with a number of buyout firms about a possible move for the club known as Spurs. It said the San Francisco fund manages the wealth of several Silicon Valley billionaires, including the founder of Facebook. In 2001 Bahamas-based Joe Lewis bought Tottenham through investment vehicle ENIC, which owns 85.55 percent of the club. Tottenham finished second in the Premier League last season behind London rivals Chelsea to again qualify for the lucrative Champions League, European soccer’s elite club competition. Spurs are building a 61,500-seat stadium on their existing White Hart Lane site for 800 million pounds and will use the national stadium at Wembley this season while the new ground is constructed for the club to use from the 2018-19 campaign. Tottenham said on their website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com) on Sunday: ”The club engaged Rothschild to secure the funding for the new stadium. As expected many proposals came forward including bank debt and equity investment. ”The club announced on 31 May 2017 the completion of the bank debt financing for the new stadium with a consortium of banks involving Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and HSBC Bank plc. “The Board believes this was the optimum solution in the interests of fans, employees and shareholders and for the continued development of the club. The Board is not in any discussions relating to a takeover offer for the club.” Tottenham announced on May 31 that the club had signed a 400 million pounds, five-year loan to help finance the cost of building the new stadium, which is being purpose-built to also stage National Football League (NFL) games.

2017-06-09,-9,"“They are spreading lies, they are spreading misinformation and they are creating more problems in our fight against the terrorists,” spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera told a news conference in Marawi City, where at least 200 militants are still holed up 18 days after their attempt to capture the town. Officials said an estimated 500-1,000 civilians were trapped in the built-up area occupied by the fighters, which came under heavy aerial bombardment on Friday.  Some civilians were being held as human shields, while others hiding in their homes fear capture by the militants and have no running water, electricity or food, said Zia Alonto Adiong, a politician involved in evacuation efforts. Fake accounts are not permitted under Facebook, and in recent months the company has launched several initiatives against fake news. “Our Community Standards do not allow groups or people that engage in terrorist activity, or posts that express support for terrorism,” a Facebook representative said in an email response to a request for comment. “Fake accounts are also prohibited. We will remove accounts and content that violate these policies when we are made aware of them.” One of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer on the insurgency-plagued island of Mindanao that analysts say is more sophisticated and media-savvy than more established groups. “Part of what we are looking at is radicalization in social media. This is used to radicalize the youth,” Herrera said. “We see massive misinformation and use of social media to facilitate propaganda activities.” About 40 foreigners have fought alongside the Philippine militants in Marawi City, most of them from Indonesia and Malaysia though some came from the Middle East. Maute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia “emir”. Military officials said they believed Hapilon and the two founding brothers of the Maute group were still in the town. Officials said the army was chipping away at the territory held by the militants. The volume of fire coming from the rebel side had dropped and their sniper firing had become more selective. However, the army had to proceed carefully because civilians were being held in mosques and madrasas, or religious schools, and the fighters had prepared for a long siege, stockpiling arms and food in tunnels and basements. According to the latest official figures, 138 militants had been killed, with the death tolls for security personnel and civilians at 40 and 20, respectively. Military spokesman Restituto Padilla said the aim was to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines’ independence day. “The chief of staff made an announcement, hoping, that by Monday we can freely wave our flags in every corner of Marawi and we are working feverishly to do that,” he said.

2016-12-28,0,"By Tim Baysinger NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Presidential politics and celebrity interviews helped The New York Times Co  surpass 100 million views for its Facebook Live videos, the company said on Wednesday. Facebook launched its livestreaming platform in August of 2015 and it is in its infancy. The New York Times has used Facebook Live to showcase its journalism, hoping to reach potential subscribers as the newspaper publisher relies more heavily on digital to grow its revenue. It was not clear how much revenue The New York Times has derived from producing these videos. Multiple media outlets reported that Facebook was paying certain media companies to produce Live videos through a one-year period from March 2016 to March 2017. The Wall Street Journal also reported that The New York Times was being paid around $3 million for the one-year period. A New York Times spokeswoman declined to comment on any financials or the Wall Street Journal report. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company has been offering “temporary financial support” to a “relatively small number of companies” to produce videos. The Times said it reached the 100 million views benchmark earlier this month. Comparative figures were not available for how the New York Times ranks against similar publishers, including The Washington Post. The Times got more 5 million views on its livestream of the first presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. There were 3.9 million views for a concert by Erykah Badu and another popular Times livestream featured singer-actress Kristin Chenoweth. Digital is becoming more important for many major U.S. media companies, particularly the New York Times, where print advertising revenue has been in freefall. During its most recent quarter, ad revenue from print slid 18.5 percent from the previous year, accounting for just 22 percent of its total revenue, said chief executive Mark Thompson during the Nov. 2 earnings call. Digital ad revenue, which saw a 21.4 percent rise, now accounts for 35.5 percent of revenue at the New York Times. During that same earnings call, chief revenue officer Meredith Kopit Levien said video was becoming more of a factor in growing digital ad revenue.

2017-11-21,5,"The move pits Shenzhen-based Tencent against rival Alibaba Group as they scramble for new growth opportunities outside China. Tencent this week became the first Asian firm to enter the club of companies worth more than $500 billion, and on Tuesday surpassed Facebook in market value.  “Malaysia is actually quite large in the sense that we have 20 million WeChat users, huge potential, and the market is quite warm towards internet products from China,” Lau said. Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and some of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has been a key battleground for China’s tech titans fighting for deals. Ethnic Chinese make up more than a fifth of Malaysia’s population. WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay, which dominate China’s digital payment market, have sought to expand their global footprint, although that push has so far been limited to payment services for Chinese outbound tourists. They can scan-and-pay for purchases in 34 countries or regions via Alipay and 13 via WeChat Pay, according to the companies. Alipay’s parent company Ant Financial has joint ventures in seven markets for local digital payments services, which operate independently under the partnerships’ brand names. Alibaba is looking to build a global payment system, while Tencent is more interested in generating traffic for WeChat - two different strategies, some bankers and investors say. WeChat has more users, but Alipay’s aggregate transaction volume is higher, according to JP Morgan’s John Hall, though other investors note that WeChat Pay can also process large transactions if it’s used on e-commerce platforms. Tencent is “not in a hurry” to speed up its overseas expansion or increase the monetization rate of its digital assets, Lau said. “We walk our own path at our own pace ... and, to be honest, there is really quite a lot to do in China,” he said. WeChat, which has ballooned from a messaging app to an all-in-one platform with 980 million monthly active users, could be the “killer product” to spearhead expansion abroad, Lau said, as its embedded payment function draws more services. “Honour of Kings”, Tencent’s top-grossing battle game that led an 84 percent increase in quarterly smartphone gaming revenue, also owes its success to the network help of WeChat, and is expected to find it tougher to crack Western markets, analysts say. Tencent this month delayed the launch of the game’s U.S. edition, “Arena of Valor”, to next year to “further polish additional gameplay and social features”. After games and social media, most of Tencent’s other businesses are in digital content, including Spotify equivalent Tencent Music and YouTube equivalent Tencent Video, which also makes its own dramas. “What we’re aiming to create is ‘super IPs’ (intellectual property) that leverage our different businesses from upstream to downstream,” Lau said, citing Disneyland and the James Bond movies as successful practices in the West. A big business for Tencent’s recently listed publishing arm, China Literature, is to sell its popular novels and have them turned into dramas and video games by Tencent’s other business lines. Tencent this month announced a plan involving 10 billion yuan ($1.51 billion) of investment to boost its creative content ecosystem, though it gave no time frame for the investment. Company president Martin Lau - no relation to S.Y. - said on an earnings call last week that Tencent would keep investing in digital content, especially online video, to draw more time from more paying customers. Overseas acquisitions will remain a key way of enhancing Tencent’s global access and competitiveness, S.Y. Lau said. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor said Tencent’s 2016 acquisition of Supercell gave it a strong position in gaming, while the move to buy a stake in social media firm Snapchat is another piece in the jigsaw. “It increasingly looks as if Tencent is embarking on a circumnavigation of the digital life pie in order to build an ecosystem to challenge the Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook dominance of consumer digital services,” he said, noting it’s at a “super early stage” in that process. Tencent will likely seek more overseas acquisitions, Windsor added, which, beyond being expensive, could challenge Tencent in integrating all its digital assets at home and abroad. Tencent has struggled to monetize its dominance over the Chinese digital life, he said, adding that’s why he sees more upside in Tencent’s market valuation, and prefers it to Alibaba. "
2017-06-14,-22,"The conviction of Taimoor Raza, 30, follows a high-profile crackdown against blasphemy on social media by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive topic in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where insulting the Prophet Mohammad is a capital crime for which dozens are sitting on death row. Even mere accusations are enough to spark mass uproar and mob justice. Shafiq Qureshi, public prosecutor in Bahawalpur, about 500km (300 miles) south of provincial capital Lahore, said Raza was convicted for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad, his wives and companions. “An anti terrorism court of Bahawalpur has awarded him the death sentence,” Qureshi told Reuters.“	It is the first ever death sentence in a case that involves social media.” It is rare for a counter-terrorism court to hear blasphemy cases but Raza’s trial fell under this category because his charge sheet included counter-terrorism offences linked to hate speech. Qureshi said Raza was arrested after playing blasphemous and hate speech material on his phone on a bus stop in Bahawalpur, where a counter-terrorism officer arrested him and confiscated his phone. The material obtained from the phone led to Raza’s conviction, he added. “The trial was conducted in Bahawapur jail in tight security,” Qureshi said Qureshi added that Raza belongs to the minority Shia community and in court he accused of spreading “hate speech” against the Deobani sect, which adheres to a strict school of Sunni Islam. Relations between Shia and majority Sunni communities have flared up at times in Pakistan, with some extremist Sunni groups such as Lashkhar-e-Janghvi trying to exploit sectarian tensions. Several other violent incidents linked to blasphemy accusations have alarmed human rights groups and activists in recent months. Police are currently investigating over 20 students and some faculty members in connection with the killing of Mashal Khan, a student who was beaten to death on April following a dorm debate about religion -- an attack that shocked the country. Since then, parliament has discussed adding safeguards to the blasphemy laws, a move seen as groundbreaking in Pakistan where political leaders have been assassinated for even discussing changes. As Raza’s blasphemy conviction was under the counter-terrorism court, he will be able to appeal his sentence in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court. There have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters. "

2017-04-17,-12,"Somewhat surprisingly, Facebook’s share price rose 1 percent on Monday, adding $3 billion of market value. But investors may reconsider, as they did when a paying passenger was dragged off a United Airlines flight. United’s stock rose at first, then declined when the scope of the incident – captured on a video that went viral - and the company’s bungled apology took its toll. Advertisers, however, have been quick to mete out punishment for shoddy content. The $400 billion social network’s value is ascribed to its dominance in digital advertising. Nomura analysts estimate that over the past three years, nearly 70 cents of every dollar of growth in the global ad market was captured by Google and Facebook.  But as evidenced by Google in recent weeks, brands will punch back. AT&T, Pepsi and a host of others boycotted the search giant’s YouTube on the grounds their ads could run next to questionable videos. Even traditional broadcast can get caught in the crosshairs. Fox News star Bill O’Reilly’s highly rated prime-time program lost more than 60 advertisers after sexual-harassment allegations involving the anchor came to light. In an earnings call in February, Zuckerberg highlighted the ability of artificial intelligence to weed out “problematic” and “violent content” because his company is grappling with its power to disseminate information to its some two billion users. Google and Twitter lean too heavily on machines, too. This weekend’s tragedy is another sign that makes clear Silicon Valley’s content stewards need more costly humans in the mix. "

The company will continue to cooperate and give the information officials need to resolve their questions, she said. Facebook informed the Commission of the planned change in January. In response to separate concerns from EU data protection watchdogs Facebook has agreed to stop sharing WhatsApp users’ information with Facebook for the purposes of improving Facebook products and advertising experiences.

2017-04-18,-9,"“Our reach now is basically all over this country,” Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told a news conference in Ohio’s second-largest city. The shooting marked the latest video clip of a violent crime to turn up on Facebook, raising questions about how the world’s biggest social media network moderates content. The company on Monday said it would begin reviewing how it monitors violent footage and other objectionable material in response to the killing. Meanwhile, a reward of $50,000 was being offered for information regarding Stephens’ location, officials said.  Police said Stephens used Facebook Inc’s service to post video of him killing Robert Godwin Sr., 74, who is seen standing on a sidewalk carrying a plastic shopping bag as the suspect gets out of his car and approaches him from the street. “Hi, can you do me a favor? Can you say, ‘Joy Lane?'” the suspect asks Godwin, referring to a woman authorities have identified as Stephen’s former girlfriend. The elderly man, looking bewildered, asks, “Joy Lane?” and the suspect is heard replying, “Yeah. She’s the reason why this is about to happen to you.” He then asks Godwin his age before gunning him down.  Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed. Lane, in a text message to CBS News commenting on the shooting, said she was “sorry that all of this has happened.” She went on to describe Stephens as having been “kind and loving to me and my children,” adding, “This is a very difficult time for me and my family.” Reuters was not able to reach Lane by phone or email for comment. “As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible,” Justin Osofsky, a Facebook vice president, said in a blog post.  Stephens, who has no prior criminal record, is not suspected in any other murders, despite a claim he made in the video of having killed more than a dozen other people, police said. “To be honest, we’ve interviewed several people involved in this and I don’t think there is any rhyme or reason for it happening,” Williams said.  The last confirmed sighting of Stephens was at the scene of the homicide. Police said he might be driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion, and asked anyone who spots him or his car to call police or a special FBI hotline (800-CALLFBI). Stephens had worked since 2008 as a vocational specialist and youth mentor at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency located outside Cleveland. Beech Brook’s offices were closed on Monday. "

But Stephens remains at large as the hunt for him expands in Ohio and neighboring states, they said. “Obviously, this individual is armed and dangerous, and quite frankly at this point he could be in a lot of places,” Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Stephen Anthony told a news conference in Cleveland. Police said Stephens used Facebook to post video of him killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed on camera in the street. Stephens, who has no prior criminal record, is not suspected in any other murders, despite a claim he made in the video of having killed more than a dozen other people, police said. “We know that Steve is still out there,” said Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams. “We’re asking the public to remain vigilant. We’re asking you to go about your day, but be careful.” The last confirmed sighting of Stephens was at the scene of the homicide. Police said he might be driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion, and asked anyone who spots him or his car to call police or a special FBI hotline (800-CALLFBI). “We’re still asking Steve to turn himself in,” said Williams. “But if he doesn‘t, we’ll find him.” Late Sunday night Cleveland police issued an aggravated murder warrant for Stephens and warned he could have crossed into Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana or Michigan. It is not the first time a serious crime has been posted on Facebook. In January, four black people in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled white man and broadcasting the assault on the social media site while making anti-white racial taunts. A month later, the suspects pleaded not guilty to assaulting the man. (Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Bernard Orr)"

German government officials have expressed concern that fake news could influence the parliamentary election expected in September, in which Merkel will run for a fourth term.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company would begin treating political ads differently from other ads, including by making it possible for anyone to see political ads, no matter whom they target. U.S. lawmakers had begun calling for regulations.  Disclosures by Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google that their products were battlegrounds for Russian election meddling last year have turned into a crisis for Silicon Valley. Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in Washington this week meeting U.S. lawmakers.  Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election.  Implementing changes is tricky, Schroepfer said, because Facebook does not want to stifle legitimate speech and because of the volume of material on Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2 billion users and 5 million advertisers.  “We’re investing very heavily in technical solutions, because we’re operating at an unprecedented scale,” he said.  Facebook is also using humans. The company said this month it would hire 1,000 more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms. Schroepfer, 42, has been Facebook’s CTO since 2013 and previously was director of engineering. He also sits on Facebook’s board of directors.  Facebook has dealt with problematic user-generated content in the past, he said.  “We don’t want misuse of the platform, whether that’s a foreign government trying to intercede in a democracy - that’s obviously not OK - or whether it’s an individual spewing hate or uploading pornography,” he said.

2016-12-19,2,"Zuckerberg announced results of the project, a personal challenge he set for himself this year, as digital home assistants by Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc compete for holiday sales and are expected to outsell popular emerging gadgets such as virtual reality headsets and drones.  Creating Jarvis proved humanity is “both closer and farther off” from an AI breakthrough than we imagine, Zuckerberg wrote. Computers are getting very good at pick out patterns, such as face recognition, but it is difficult to teach them new things, he wrote. “Everything I did this year -- natural language, face recognition, speech recognition and so on -- are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques,” he wrote. “But even if I spent 1,000 more hours, I probably wouldn’t be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own.” By the end of the year, Jarvis was able to respond to text and voice commands and it could run music, air conditioning, doors, and other systems. It could recognize visitors, start a toaster and even shoot t-shirts from a cannon in his closet. With more effort to broaden Jarvis’ use beyond Zuckerberg’s own house, the experiment “could be a great foundation to build a new product,” he wrote. A dearth of internet-connected devices, lack of common standards for connected devices to communicate and challenges related to speech recognition and machine learning were all obstacles, he said. At the same time, he said challenges lead to eureka moments.  Adjustments made to help Jarvis recognize context in commands ultimately helped the system respond to less specific requests in a better fashion, such as asking the system to “play me some music”.  “I’ve found we use these more open-ended requests more frequently than more specific asks. No commercial products I know of do this today, and this seems like a big opportunity,” he wrote. "
2016-11-19,-11,"Zuckerberg then said last Saturday that more than 99 percent of what people see on Facebook is authentic, calling “only a very small amount” fake news and hoaxes. But in his Friday posting Zuckerberg struck a decidedly different tone. He said Facebook has been working on the issue of misinformation for a long time, calling the problem complex both technically and philosophically. “While the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap,” Zuckerberg said. He also said Facebook would make it easier to report false content, work with third-party verification organizations and journalists on fact-checking efforts, and explore posting warning labels on content that has been flagged as false. The company will also try to prevent fake-news providers from making money through its advertising system, as it had previously announced. Facebook historically has relied on users to report links as false and share links to myth-busting sites, including Snopes, to determine if it can confidently classify stories as misinformation, Zuckerberg said. The service has extensive “community standards” on what kinds of content are acceptable. Facebook faced international outcry earlier this year after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook, and there have been extensive internal conversations at the company in recent months over content controversies, people familiar with the discussions say. Among the fake news reports that circulated ahead of the U.S. election were reports erroneously alleging Pope Francis had endorsed Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. "
2016-11-03,-31,"Facebook has challenged the constitutionality of the TCPA in a trio of class actions in California federal court that accuse the social media site of sending consumers unwanted text messages. In all three – Duguid v. Facebook, Brickman v. Facebook and Holt v. Facebook – Facebook contends that under the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the TCPA’s exceptions mean the law’s restrictions are based on the content of that speech. Those restrictions, Facebook argued most recently in a brief filed this week in the Holt case, cannot survive under the strict scrutiny standard for government prohibitions on free speech.  “However admirable the government interest behind the law, the TCPA’s exceptions render it a content-based restriction of speech that triggers strict scrutiny, and the court should strike it down,” Facebook said in the Holt brief.  One big obstacle for Facebook, as the Justice Department pointed out when it intervened in the Brickman and Holt class actions to defend the constitutionality of the TCPA, is that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already deemed the law to be compatible with the First Amendment, in two different decisions, 1995’s Moser v. Federal Communications Commission and 2016’s Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez. “Each time, the 9th Circuit reasoned that the Act is a permissible content-neutral, time, place, and manner restriction,” the government’s brief said. (Class action lawyers from Edelson also relied heavily on 9th Circuit precedent from Moser and Campbell-Ewald in their response to Facebook’s constitutional argument.)  Facebook countered that the Supreme Court’s Reed decision changed the analysis for what constitutes a content-based restriction on free speech – and that no appeals court has decided a First Amendment challenge to the TCPA since the Reed opinion. That case, as you may recall, involved signage restrictions in the town of Gilbert, Arizona. For aesthetic and traffic-control reasons, the town banned all outdoor public signs, with a few exceptions for (among other things) political, ideological and temporary signs providing directions to certain sorts of events. A church that holds services in different locations sued the town after it received citations for violating the time limit for directional signs.  The Supreme Court majority ruled the town’s ordinance was an unconstitutional content-based restriction on free speech, overturning a 9th Circuit ruling to the contrary. “A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government’s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of ‘animus toward the ideas contained’ in the regulated speech,” wrote Justice Clarence Thomas for the majority. “An innocuous justification cannot transform a facially content-based law into one that is content neutral.”  According to Facebook, the Reed decision compels a finding that the TCPA is unconstitutional because, on its face, the statute “allows some calls but bans others based on the subject matter and purpose of the message.” The government (and the TCPA plaintiffs in the Holt case) argue in response that the Reed opinion was not a really a shift in First Amendment doctrine. And even if it were, the Justice Department brief said, Facebook’s text messages were commercial speech, which is entitled to a lesser standard of First Amendment protection.  Clearly, defendants all over America would be thrilled if Facebook managed to persuade the courts that the TCPA is unconstitutional – a feat no previous TCPA defendant has managed to pull off, despite a fair number of First Amendment challenges to the law. But as even Facebook acknowledges, the trial judges overseeing the three class actions have to consider the social network’s more prosaic arguments for dismissal for before they can reach the constitutional dispute.  Indeed, the Duguid case was already tossed once by U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar of San Francisco because he found the texts at issue didn’t fall under the parameters of the TCPA. After plaintiffs’ lawyers at Lemberg Law filed an amended complaint, they agreed with Facebook defense counsel from Kirkland to wait for a decision on all other dismissal arguments before briefing the First Amendment arguments. Judge Tigar is also overseeing the Holt class action. U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco is presiding over the Brickman case. It’s likely that one of those, which are running on similar timetables, will produce a First Amendment decision before Duguid."

Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.  Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.  “I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.  Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.  The Russian government has denied it intended to influence  the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.   Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.  Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.  Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.  Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers. Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.  “You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.  The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.  Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”   Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.  The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a “patchwork” of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.  "
2017-10-12,-3,"By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on Thursday that the company was fully committed to helping U.S. congressional investigators publicly release Russia-backed political ads that ran during the 2016 U.S. election. Sandberg said during an interview with the Axios news website that “things happened on our platform in this election that shouldn’t have happened.” Facebook recently gave congressional panels investigating allegations of Russian meddling during the election more than 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia. The social media company found them on its network and said the ads appeared in the months before and after the election. Sandberg said she was supportive of those ads being released in addition to the pages they were connected to. “We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg said. She added that in many cases, accounts were taken down because they were fake, but that if those accounts were run by real people, the social media network would have not removed them.

2016-11-16,-4,"“We want to ensure our clients trust and believe in the metrics that we are providing,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global market solutions told Reuters. Getting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook’s continued revenue growth, as they fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads. Facebook, along with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and other large digital companies, has been criticized for a lack of transparency in how it measures the performance of videos.  Particularly, the lack of a universally agreed method of calculating how much time people are watching online video has been a sore spot for advertisers. Shares of Facebook were down 2.5 percent at $114.30 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In September, Facebook told advertisers that the average time users spent viewing online ads was artificially inflated, because it was only counting videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a “view.” Facebook left out those who watched for less than three seconds, or who did not watch the video at all, which gave advertisers the impression their videos were performing better than they really were. Since the admission and ensuing criticism from advertisers, Everson said Facebook has been in contact with clients and ad community trade groups, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Facebook also said on Wednesday it is in the process of forming what it called a ‘Measurement Council,’ which will include measurement experts from clients and ad agencies.  One of Facebook’s prominent advertisers, Swiss food and drink company Nestle SA (NESN.S), is already on board, Everson said, and the council should be up and running by early 2017.  The ANA, which represents Procter & Gamble Co, AT&T Inc and other major advertisers, has called on Facebook to get its metrics accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent media measurement audit group.  While Facebook’s internal metrics are not accredited by that group, it does use MRC-accredited third-party vendors, such as Nielsen and comScore, to help advertisers verify certain data. (This version of the story corrects spelling of Procter & Gamble in paragraph 13) "
2017-10-12,-17,"Axios asked Sandberg what the world’s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia’s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.  The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.  Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.  She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of  revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election. Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumors around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review. Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said. Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was “free from abuse” during any election in any country. “We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg said.  She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users. Sandberg said it was important to protect “free expression” on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site. She criticized Twitter’s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. “In that ad, there are a lot of things that people don’t like, that I don’t like. ... But the question is, ‘Should divisive political or issue ads run?’ Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,” she said. Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work toward making ad purchases more transparent, and she said  Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue. Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1. "

2017-09-27,-12,"The leaders of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said the panel would hold an open hearing next month with representatives from unnamed technology companies in an effort to “better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.” Representatives for Facebook and Google confirmed they had received invitations from the Senate committee but did not say whether the companies would attend. Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The House panel did not immediately identify any companies, but a committee source said lawmakers expected to hear from the same three firms the Senate had asked to testify. The requests are the latest move by congressional investigators to gain information from internet companies as they probe the extent of Moscow’s alleged efforts to disrupt last year’s U.S. election. Lawmakers in both parties have grown increasingly concerned that social networks may have played a key role in Russia’s influence operation. Facebook revealed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that has prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads. On Wednesday, Trump attacked Facebook in a tweet and suggested the world’s largest social network had colluded with other media outlets that opposed him. The president has been skeptical of the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election and has denied his campaign colluded with Moscow. “That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page. Republican Senator James Lankford, who has received classified information about Russia’s interference as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the country’s attempts to sow discord in U.S. domestic affairs had not abated. Russian internet trolls over the weekend fueled the debate ignited by Trump over whether NFL players should have the right to kneel during the national anthem,  Lankford said. Also on Wednesday, the Daily Beast, citing unnamed sources, reported that a Facebook group named “United Muslims of America” was a fake account linked to the Russian government and that it was used to push false claims about U.S. politicians, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  The group bought Facebook ads to reach targeted audiences, promoting political rallies aimed at Muslims, the website reported. The Senate and House intelligence committees are two of the main congressional panels probing allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the U.S. election to boost Trump’s chances at winning the White House, and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

2017-03-17,-7,"The companies proposed some ways to resolve the issues and discussed them with the authorities on Thursday, the person said, adding that the meeting was constructive. The source was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity. U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy to how quickly they remove illegal or hateful content. The authorities sent letters to the companies in December saying that some of service terms broke European Union consumer protection law and that they needed to do more to tackle fraud and scams on their websites. According to the letters seen by Reuters, some of those terms include requiring users to seek redress in court in California, where the companies are based, instead of their country of residence. Other issues include not identifying sponsored content clearly, requiring consumers to waive mandatory rights such as the right to cancel a contract, and an excessive power for the companies to determine the suitability of content generated by users, according to the letters. In the case of Alphabet’s Google unit, the concerns were about its social network Google+. Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment. The authorities are being supported by the European Commission and could impose fines if they are not satisfied. The authorities also proposed setting up a standard communication channel to notify the companies of content deemed illegal and the action requested, according to the letters."

2017-11-01,-15,"The Senate Intelligence Committee questioned lawyers for Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google as part of a broader investigation into possible Russian interference in last year’s election. Facebook again received the bulk of scrutiny from lawmakers who expressed frustration with the world’s largest social network because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet. Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch told the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on its picture-sharing service Instagram beginning in October 2016. An additional four million may have seen such material on Instagram prior to October, though that data was less complete, Stretch said. The Instagram figures were in addition to the 126 million Americans who may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, a number the company disclosed earlier this week. Democrats and Republicans both said the tech companies need to do more to police against foreign government abuse on their platforms. Some Republicans, however, sought to distance the scrutiny of the companies from questions about the legitimacy of U.S. President Donald Trump’s election victory. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said it was impossible to measure the impact or know the motivation of the Russian operation to spread political material on social media. Any conclusions that Trump benefited from Russia, perhaps in a decisive way, to secure a victory ignored the complexity of the issue, Burr said. “I’m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily,” he said. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he believed that Twitter was “vastly underestimating” the amount of fake and automated accounts on its platform. He cited independent research that has estimated around 15 percent of Twitter accounts or fake or automated. Sean Edgett, Twitter’s acting general counsel, said less than 5 percent of its accounts were automated. Some senators criticized the companies for sending lawyers, not chief executives, to testify. “If we go through this exercise again, we would appreciate seeing the top people who are making the decision,” said Senator Angus King, an independent. The companies were also scheduled to testify before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee later on Wednesday. "

Trump and the Russian administration deny interference or collusion. The investigations include looking into how Russian entities may have used social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to promote events and spread false news stories attacking Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Facebook said on Tuesday that some ads bought by Russians last year promoted events during the U.S. presidential campaign. The company said its takedown of what it last week called Russian-affiliated pages included shutting down “several promoted events.” [nL2N1LT2IT] “It certainly appears that the Russians were engaged in a multi-pronged approach in using social media, through paid advertising, through paid event organizing, through dissemination and amplification of false and negative stories,” Schiff said. He said the committee needed to hear from the companies in either classified or public settings, to assess how the Russians had used social media, how the companies had investigated on their own and what else needed to be done.

One from an account called “Army of Jesus” said Clinton was supported by evil forces. “Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,” the post read. It added that Republican candidate Donald Trump was “an honest man” who “cares deeply for this country.” Other ads appeared to be aimed at setting up clashes over hot-button issues.

Another ad from a separate Facebook page promoted a pro-Islam rally at the same time and venue.

Shares of Facebook and Apple both hit record highs on Tuesday, up 0.53 percent and 0.75 percent respectively. Surges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year.  And planned measures by President Donald Trump for steep corporate tax cuts and the easing of tax restrictions on profits made abroad would help Apple and other technology companies return more cash to shareholders.

2017-05-10,1,"While Facebook’s shares recovered from the drubbing within two quarters and trade at nearly four times their $38 IPO price, Twitter’s shares never completely regained lost ground and currently trade down nearly a third from their $26 IPO price.  The options market is already positioned for a double-digit swing in Snap shares by the end of this week.  One key to Snap, the owner of the wildly popular Snapchat messaging app, dodging a similar reception from the market rests on whether its user growth and engagement measures meet investors’ expectations as Facebook aggressively copies its most successful features.  The earnings report and subsequent conference call after the bell “will be make it or break it” for Snap, said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital.  The stock, which started trading in March in the largest tech IPO since Facebook’s in 2012, jumped 44 percent on its debut, but has since fallen 5.5 percent from that day’s closing price. On Wednesday, the shares were down 1.11 percent to $23.06.  But investors will focus on Snapchat’s user numbers and how the service is holding up against encroachments by rivals.  In recent months, Facebook has launched Facebook Stories, a near-identical clone of Snapchat’s most popular feature, also called Stories. The feature lets users post a string of videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours and is also available on other Facebook services, including Instagram and WhatsApp.  “Much of the call should be around Stories as it represents the bulk of Snap’s future value given the importance of video advertising to the company’s relatively nascent business model,” Goodwater’s Kim said.  Facebook recently announced that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users (DAU), eclipsing Snapchat’s year-end overall DAU count of around 161 million.  JPMorgan expects Snap’s first-quarter DAU to grow to 169 million, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc is targeting 173 million.  Snap still may have an edge over Facebook with its active user base aged between 18 and 34, many of whom visit more than 18 times a day and are a highly coveted group for advertisers.  ""Our favorable outlook on Snap stems not only from the company's ability to innovate and cater to millennials in high value markets, but also capture publisher content and consumer mindshare as video consumption grows on digital,"" said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi.  “We saw $100 million worth of short selling in this past week, ahead of the earnings and Snap short interest stands at $946 million, which is the highest level since the IPO,” he said.

2017-05-02,3,"“If we look at the lion’s share of the numbers, they’re performing above expectations,” said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares of Apple worth about $41 million and shares of Facebook worth $68 million.  “It gives validity to my position, which is that tech is, by far, the most exciting sector,” Morgan said. Shares of Facebook and Apple both hit record highs on Tuesday, up 0.53 percent and 0.75 percent respectively. Surges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year.  And planned measures by President Donald Trump for steep corporate tax cuts and the easing of tax restrictions on profits made abroad would help Apple and other technology companies return more cash to shareholders.   The largest five Silicon Valley companies for years have been increasing their share of revenue and profits generated in the technology sector at the expense of smaller competitors.  Those five players boosted their share of revenue among technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to 46 percent in 2016, from 38 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data. Their share of net income increased to 46 percent from 42 percent during the same time.  Facebook and Google, which is owned by Alphabet, received 77 percent of gross spending on digital advertising in 2016, compared to 72 percent the year before, according to industry data analyzed by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.  Technology company earnings are expected to have grown 17.7 percent in the latest three months, the strongest quarterly expansion since 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple is expected by analysts to have boosted its revenue by 4.8 percent when it reports on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to post a 45.6-percent leap in revenue and a similar increase in earnings per share, according to analysts’ estimates. "
2017-09-27,-13,"Smith and the Republicans on the committee that oversees U.S. scientific agencies have targeted mainstream climate change scientists, questioning their integrity and calling for eliminating federal funding for climate research. They have also accused environmental groups of colluding with Russians to push for regulations to curb fossil fuel extraction. “The committee is concerned that divisive social media and political messages conveyed through social media have negatively affected certain energy sectors, which can depress research and development in the fossil fuel sector and expanding potential for natural gas,” Smith wrote in letters to the CEOs. The committee, which oversees U.S. scientific agencies, believes such anti-fracking ads reflect “the Russian government’s concern about the impact of fracking ... on the global energy market and potential challenges to profitability” of Russian energy companies, the letter said. The letter says Russia’s meddling in the U.S. energy market has been “well documented in the public domain” and seeks information similar to what Facebook is providing to the U.S. Senate about anti-immigration propaganda and advertising. Both parties in Washington have been stepping up scrutiny of major internet firms, and considering whether to create new disclosure rules for online political ads after Facebook revealed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations is probing whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Trump and officials from the campaign have said there was no collusion. Smith is dismissive of local and national protests that have emerged around the country objecting to the process of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas because of its affect on water quality, as well as the construction of pipelines to transport fracked oil and gas.

2017-10-18,-18,"Kriti Bharti, founder of Saarthi Trust, has helped nullify more than 30 child marriages in the western state of Rajasthan, and recently used Facebook posts as evidence in court in a state where these marriages are often held secretly at night.  “We have a law against child marriage in the country, but that law is not being implemented properly,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  “For the first time in my career, I used evidence from Facebook, and for the first time, I think, the court admitted such evidence and annulled a marriage.” India accounts for a third of the global total of more than 700 million women married as children, according to UNICEF, the United Nations children’s agency. Despite a law banning girls from marrying before they turn 18, the practice is deeply rooted in tradition and widely accepted in Indian society. It is rarely reported as a crime and the police are often reluctant to prosecute offenders. While boys also marry before the legal age of 21, girls are disproportionately affected. Early marriage makes it more likely that girls will drop out of school, and campaigners say it also increases risks of sexual violence, domestic abuse and death in childbirth. In Bharti’s recent annulment case, Sushila, who was married at 12, had no photographs or registration to prove her marriage, which was denied by her young husband and his family. Bharti scoured the boy’s Facebook profile and found evidence, including posts congratulating him on his marriage, which the court accepted. While other activists are using mobile apps and cash incentives to deter child marriage, Bharti believes rescuing underage brides is also critical. “Taking action to prevent child marriage is important,” she said. “But annulments and voiding of marriages that have already taken place can do more to discourage other families from even thinking about it.” States are also acting to strengthen the law: southern Karnataka state this year amended its child marriage act to make any such marriage automatically invalid. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court struck down a decades-old clause in the country’s rape laws permitting a man to have sex with his wife if she is aged between 15 to 18 - ruling that it was rape, and therefore a criminal offense. The landmark verdict will help curb child marriage, campaigners said. "

2016-12-06,0,"Everything from old ski clothes to cars are bought and sold on Schibsted’s sites while the company is recruiting heavily to deepen its offering in categories like real estate and jobs. Schibsted faces a test of whether it can fend off the likes of Facebook and Google, exploiting its local character in a $21 billion industry which McKinsey & Co sees growing at 10 percent annually. Facebook, which is searching for new ways to engage users, launched its “Marketplace” in October where people can buy and sell items locally, in what was seen as a step into the classified advertising market. Facebook must be taken “very seriously”, Schibsted Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal told Reuters in an interview. “So far, we think they are enlarging the total market, but we are watching very closely what they are doing,” he said. The classified ads business accounted for 38 percent of Schibsted’s revenues last year and 81 percent of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which amounted to 2 billion crowns ($239 million). The launch of Facebook’s Marketplace has weighed heavily on Schibsted shares, which have fallen 22 percent since October to trade around 177.6 crowns on Tuesday, a near 40 percent drop this year. Schibsted has been cutting costs in its newspaper division while spending more on its technology operations and recruiting in its five European technology hubs of London, Barcelona, Stockholm, Oslo and Krakow. In the past two years Schibsted has recruited a team of 100 in London. Facebook announced last month it would hire 500 new staff in Britain next year, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs there. Schibsted is investing in its mobile “boot sale” app Shpock which is available in six countries. It is also working to boost its professional content, aimed at commercial sellers, in real estate, jobs and cars - areas which it believes can generate greater revenues.  Developers are working on products like messaging, automatic picture recognition and pricing tools for professionals. One Nordic fund manager with a position in Schibsted felt the Facebook threat had been overplayed as it looked like the social media giant was not planning much in the “professional” market. Ryssdal said it would require something very special to disrupt the markets that Schibsted dominates today. “Traditionally what Facebook and Google are good at is making big and scalable solutions while what we are good at is focusing on exactly what are we doing and then adapting to local markets both product-wise but also with boots on the ground,” he said.

2017-05-10,-1,"By Angela Moon and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Snap Inc has many similarities with archrivals Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc , but shareholders are eager to avoid one in particular when the social media company reports earnings on Wednesday for the first time since its initial public offering: a plunging stock price. Investors delivered a stern message of disappointment to Facebook and Twitter when they posted debut quarterly scorecards following their IPOs. Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the following day, while Facebook’s tumbled 11 percent, drops that stand to this day as the biggest one-day losses for both. The options market is already positioned for a double-digit swing in Snap shares by the end of this week. One key to Snap, the owner of the wildly popular Snapchat messaging app, dodging a similar reception from the market rests on whether its user growth and engagement measures meet investors’ expectations as Facebook aggressively copies its most successful features. The earnings report and subsequent conference call after the bell “will be make it or break it” for Snap, said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital. The stock, which started trading in March in the largest tech IPO since Facebook’s in 2012, jumped 44 percent on its debut, but has since fallen 5.5 percent from that day’s closing price. But investors will focus on Snapchat’s user numbers and how the service is holding up against encroachments by rivals. In recent months, Facebook has launched Facebook Stories, a near-identical clone of Snapchat’s most popular feature, also called Stories. The feature lets users post a string of videos and photos that disappear after 24 hours and is also available on other Facebook services, including Instagram and WhatsApp. “Much of the call should be around Stories as it represents the bulk of Snap’s future value given the importance of video advertising to the company’s relatively nascent business model,” Goodwater’s Kim said. Facebook recently announced that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users (DAU), eclipsing Snapchat’s year-end overall DAU count of around 161 million. JPMorgan expects Snap’s first-quarter DAU to grow to 166 million, while Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co Inc is targeting 173 million. Snap still may have an edge over Facebook with its active user base aged between 18 and 34, many of whom visit more than 18 times a day and are a highly coveted group for advertisers. “Our favorable outlook on Snap stems not only from the company’s ability to innovate and cater to millennials in high value markets, but also capture publisher content and consumer mindshare as video consumption grows on digital,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi. “We saw $100 million worth of short selling in this past week, ahead of the earnings and Snap short interest stands at $946 million, which is the highest level since the IPO,” he said. Meanwhile, options market activity suggests a swing of about 13.5 percent in either direction by Friday, based on the price of certain options expiring this week. “Snap’s option activity was bullish last week, but the bears came out in greater force just two days before earnings,” said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade in Chicago.

2017-09-10,-19,"They both deny any wrongdoing. The young Netanyahu is widely seen in Israel as being groomed by his parents as a future political leader and the Facebook posts have attracted particular public interest. On Saturday, he posted a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father’s critics. It included a depiction of U.S. billionaire George Soros at the top of a food chain, dangling the world in front of both a reptile and former prime minister Ehud Barak, a frequent critic of Netanyahu. Jewish financiers controlling the world is a well-known anti-Semitic theme. Soros supports left-wing and human rights organizations that have been highly critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians. The Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League denounced the cartoon on Twitter, writing: “The caricature posted by Yair Netanyahu includes explicit anti-Semitic elements. One cannot belittle the danger inherent in an anti-Semitic discourse.” In further Facebook posts following criticism for posting  the cartoon, Yair Netanyahu, who is a university student, condemned the Israeli left for being two-faced in trying to silence him. A family spokesman said Yair Netanyahu would not be making any other comment. The prime minister refused to ask questions from reporters about the post on Sunday morning at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting. Last month, the son made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia.  It appeared to suggest that hard-left organizations now pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups, which he wrote are a dying breed. In July, Netanyahu junior found himself in a bizarre social media row over dog poo. A neighbor of the family said on Facebook that Yair, who lives with his parents, responded with an obscene gesture and walked away after she had asked him to clean up the mess left by the dog he was walking in a park. The post went viral. A family spokesman said at the time that the woman had behaved aggressively and “Yair does not know if Kaiya (the dog) did defecate as (she) alleges”. Some critics in Israel suggested Netanyahu’s online activities were meant to deflect attention from his parent’s legal troubles.      On Friday, Israel’s attorney-general said he was considering indicting Sara Netanyahu on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served as prime minister for 11 years, spread over four terms, is being investigated by police in two corruption cases. "

2017-07-27,3,"* Twitter falls on weaker-than-expected user growth * Verizon up after posting subscriber growth * Durable goods order for June rises * Indexes up: Dow 0.30 pct, S&P 0.12 pct, Nasdaq 0.37 pct (Updates to open) By Tanya Agrawal July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to their record levels at the open on Thursday, driven by gains in Facebook and Verizon. Facebook jumped 4.23 percent, lifting both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes, after the social network’s results beat Wall Street estimates. Verizon surged 6 percent to $47 after its quarterly subscriber additions topped estimates. The stock was the second-biggest gainer on both the S&P and the Dow. Earnings of S&P 500 companies are now expected to have climbed 9.9 percent in the second quarter, up from a projection of an 8 percent rise at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. With equity markets at record levels, investors have been counting on strong earnings to justify the relatively expensive stock valuations. “The earnings season has arguably taken on additional importance this quarter due to the inability of Donald Trump to, so far, deliver on the growth agenda that won him the White House back in November,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda. “Even in the absence of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus, corporate America has continued to perform well, with companies exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line.” Investor sentiment also got a boost after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. The central bank noted that both overall inflation and a measure of underlying price gains had declined. The statement was perceived as dovish by investors, with rate futures pricing in a 38 percent chance of an interest rate hike by December, compared with a little over 50 percent chance priced in before the meeting. At 9:43 a.m. ET (1343 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.76 points, or 0.3 percent, at 21,775.77 and the S&P 500 was up 3.18 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,481.01. The Nasdaq Composite was up 23.83 points, or 0.37 percent, at 6,446.57. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the telecommunication index’s 2.39 percent rise leading the advancers. Twitter was down 13.46 percent after the company’s quarterly results showed it failed to add users on a monthly basis in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter. PayPal Holdings rose 2.53 percent, while Dunkin’ Brands was up 2.60 percent after their quarterly reports. United Parcel Service fell 2.25 percent despite the U.S. domestic package service posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Online giant Amazon, Intel, Starbucks and Mattel are among those reporting results after the bell.

2016-12-08,-19,"The data these companies collect, for example, could have told us in real-time whether fake news was having an impact on voters. Information garnered from social media platforms could have boosted voter turnout as citizens realized the race was closer than the polls showed – and that their votes really would matter. Instead, these companies let the United States and UK tumble into a democratic deficit, with political institutions starved of quality data on public opinion.  Legally, social media companies aren’t obligated to share data in the public interest. And what they can share is always shaped by users’ privacy settings, country-specific rules about selling personal information, and the particular deals companies like Facebook and Twitter make with third party businesses. But they are now the primary platforms for political conversation. As such, they should act in ways that support democratic practices, especially around sensitive political moments like elections.  Facebook and Twitter have the ability to reach, and target, millions of voters. From the minute you sign up on one of these platforms, the companies use data about your behavior, interests, family and friends to recommend news and new social connections. And they sell this data to other companies for even deeper analysis on what you might buy and what you think about important social issues.  By examining data about the connections you make and content you share, social media companies can make powerful inferences about whether you are likely to vote, how you are likely to vote, and what kinds of news or advertisements might encourage or discourage you to engage as a citizen.  Social media firms regularly study the news consumption habits of users, producing fine-grained analysis of the causes and consequences of political polarization on its platform. To that end, only Facebook and Twitter know how pervasive fabricated news stories and misinformation campaigns have become during referendums and elections. They know who clicked on what links, how much time each user spent reading an “article,” and where the user was physically located.  If the companies merged user data with other datasets – say, from credit card records or voter registration files – they may even know the user’s voting history and which political groups the user has donated to. These companies know enough about voter attitudes to serve up liberal news to liberals and conservative news to conservatives, or fake news to undecided voters.  During the recent U.S. presidential election, there was a worrying amount of false information on both Facebook and Twitter, and research suggests that many users can’t distinguish between real and fabricated news. My own research on this “computational propaganda” shows that Facebook and Twitter can be easily used to poison political conversations. Trump campaigners were particularly good at using bots – basic software programs with communication skills – to propagate lies. Bogus news sites were started just to make money for their founders, but undoubtedly influenced some voters' view when manipulated images and false reports went viral.  Several major U.S. tech companies have since announced steps to reign in fabricated news. In response to criticism about the spread of misinformation on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg described in a post some of the projects the company already has underway, including making it easier for users to report fake news. Facebook has also updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to this type of content. Google has said it is working to prevent websites that spread bogus news from using its advertising platform. But more can be done.  While social media use has been on the rise, our systems for measuring public opinion have been breaking down. Telephone- and internet-based surveys are increasingly inaccurate. With so many people on mobile phones, consuming political content that comes to them through friends, family and Facebook, traditional polling companies no longer get a full picture of what the public knows and wants.  For modern democracies to work, three kinds of polling systems need to be up and running. First, nationwide exit polls, which identify mistakes in how elections are run, helping to confirm or refute claims of fraud. For several decades exit polling was coordinated by major news outlets, but the coalition broke down in the United States in 2002 and 2005 in the UK. Today, exit polls are run haphazardly, and are more about predicting winners and outcomes than systematically checking the results.  Second, democracies need a regular supply of public policy polls so that journalists, public policy makers, civic groups and elected officials can understand public opinion before and after voting day.  Third, democracies need “deliberative polls” that put complex policy questions to representative groups of voters who are given time to evaluate the possible solutions. These kinds of polls engage citizens about public policy options through extended conversations with experts and each other. They lead to more informed decision-making.  Companies like Facebook and Twitter manage the platforms over which most citizens in advanced democracies now talk about politics, and they could be the critical new platforms for these polling systems. They could never completely replace existing techniques for measuring public opinion. But our existing polling systems are weakening, and social media platforms have an obvious role to play.  With the data at their disposal and the platforms they maintain, social media companies could raise standards for civility by refusing to accept ad revenue for placing fake news. They could let others audit and understand the algorithms that determine who sees what on a platform. Just as important, they could be the platforms for doing better opinion, exit and deliberative polling.  This year, Facebook and Twitter watched as ways of measuring public opinion collapsed. Allowing fake news and computational propaganda to target specific voters is an act against democratic values. But withholding data about public opinion is the major crime against democracy.

Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

But Stephens remained at large as the search for him expanded nationwide, police said. The shooting marked the latest video clip of a violent crime to turn up on Facebook, raising questions about how the world’s biggest social media network moderates content. The company on Monday said it would begin reviewing how it monitors violent footage and other objectionable material in response to the killing. Police said Stephens used Facebook Inc’s service to post video of him killing Robert Godwin Sr., 74. Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed. Facebook vice president Justin Osofsky said the company was reviewing the procedure that users go through to report videos and other material that violates the social media platform’s standards. The shooting video was visible on Facebook for nearly two hours before it was reported, the company said. Stephens, who has no prior criminal record, is not suspected in any other murders, police said. The last confirmed sighting of Stephens was at the scene of the homicide. Police said he might be driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion, and asked anyone who spots him or his car to call police or a special FBI hotline (800-CALLFBI).

2017-07-25,-7,"Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the rules. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet. The outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved. Other chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Several companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify. Comcast said it welcomed the hearing and “believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.” ”A strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it’s time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet,” said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. “The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.” Democrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the “largest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion,” said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation. A group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid “fast lanes.” Major internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place. More than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.” "

Late Sunday night Cleveland police issued a aggravated murder warrant for Stephens, and warned that he could have crossed state lines into Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana or Michigan.

Since then, more than 26,000 people have been detained, including many opposition activists, according to an April parliamentary report. A state of emergency has been partially lifted, but many restrictions are still in place.  Yonatan’s charges were brought under a 2009 law that prescribes jail terms of 10 to 20 years for anyone convicted of publishing information that could induce readers to commit acts of terrorism. His lawyer Shibiru Belete said Thursday’s sentence handed down by a high court in the capital Addis Ababa took into account the 17 months Yonatan has already spent behind bars. “That is unless it is reversed by appeal (by prosecutors),” he told Reuters. Thursday’s sentencing comes a day after Ethiopia convicted a journalist of inciting violence against the state. Reporter Getachew Shiferaw will be sentenced on Friday. Critics say Ethiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, regularly uses security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and clamp down on media freedoms.

It will also update its policies to more explicitly require advertisers to not engage in discriminatory advertising. The changes come two weeks after ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news organization, published an article showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude groups on the basis of ethnic affinities, a practice it said may violate federal housing and civil rights laws passed in the 1960s. A group of Facebook users filed a lawsuit against the company after the ProPublica report, claiming such ad targeting violated the Fair Housing Act and Civil Rights Act.

Facebook’s 1.1 percent fall weighed the most on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The social media giant reported surging quarterly profit and revenue, but investors showed some nervousness about future earnings. Energy stocks were dragged lower as crude oil prices dropped more than 2.5 percent to their lowest since late November on concerns over rising global supply. The energy sector fell 1.57 percent, leading the laggards among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors. At the other end of the spectrum were financials, which gained 0.65 after a hawkish statement from the Federal Reserve indicated the central bank was on track to raise interest rates in June. The Fed emphasized the strength of the labor market and said consumer spending continued to be solid, business investment had firmed and inflation has been “running close” to its target. Futures traders are now pricing in a 72 percent chance of June rate hike, up from 63 percent before the Fed’s statement on Wednesday, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. “The Fed wrote off the first quarter as being a temporary slowdown and I don’t think that’s really any surprise as the focus really should be on the jobs report,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida, referring to the April U.S. non-farm payrolls data due Friday. At 9:49 a.m. ET (1349 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,936.85.

2017-05-25,-19,"Yonatan Tesfaye, a former spokesperson for the opposition Semayawi Party, was arrested in 2015 and charged in May last year over remarks he made about anti-government protests on the social media site. Hundreds of people died in anti-government demonstrations in 20015 and 2016 in the Horn of Africa nation. Since then, more than 26,000 people have been detained, including many opposition activists, according to an April parliamentary report. A state of emergency has been partially lifted, but many restrictions are still in place.  Yonatan’s charges were brought under a 2009 law that prescribes jail terms of 10 to 20 years for anyone convicted of publishing information that could induce readers to commit acts of terrorism. His lawyer Shibiru Belete said Thursday’s sentence handed down by a high court in the capital Addis Ababa took into account the 17 months Yonatan has already spent behind bars. “That is unless it is reversed by appeal (by prosecutors),” he told Reuters. Thursday’s sentencing comes a day after Ethiopia convicted a journalist of inciting violence against the state. Reporter Getachew Shiferaw will be sentenced on Friday. Critics say Ethiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, regularly uses security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and clamp down on media freedoms. Ethiopia’s 547-seat parliament does not have a single opposition politician in it. Opposition groups accuse the government of constant harassment and intimidation. "
2017-04-18,-8,"Pennsylvania State Police officers found Stephens in Erie County, Pennsylvania, after getting a tip around 11 a.m. local time from a “concerned citizen” who saw Stephens at a McDonald‘s, Major William Teper Jr. of the Pennsylvania State Police told a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. Local media said an employee at the restaurant’s drive-through window called police. Stephens had left the restaurant but stopped briefly when officers located his car nearby. He sped away, and police then hit his car with their vehicle, causing him to lose control and spin out, at which point Stephens shot himself, Teper said. Stephens, who had no prior criminal record, was not suspected in any other killings, Cleveland officials said. Stephens said in a separate video on Facebook on Sunday that he had already killed a dozen others.  The shooting marked the latest video clip of a violent crime to turn up on Facebook, raising questions about how the world’s biggest social media network moderates content.  The company will do all it can to prevent content like Stephens’ post, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Facebook’s annual conference for software developers on Tuesday in San Jose, California. Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed. In interviews, some of Godwin’s relatives forgave his killer. “I forgive him because we are all sinners,” Robby Miller, Godwin’s son, said in an interview with CNN.  Others were less sympathetic.  “All I can say is that I wish he had gone down in a hail of 100 bullets,” Godwin’s daughter, Brenda Haymon, told CNN. “I wish it had gone down like that instead of him shooting himself.” "
2017-04-17,-17,"“Everybody is out there looking for Steve,” Calvin Williams, the Cleveland police chief, told a news conference, where he joined Mayor Frank Jackson in asking Stephens to turn himself in. They said Stephens might be driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion, and that he was armed and dangerous.   “We want this to end with as much peace as we can bring to this right now,” Williams said, adding police knew of no other victims. Late Sunday night Cleveland police issued a aggravated murder warrant for Stephens, and warned that he could have crossed state lines into Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana or Michigan. The world’s largest online social network, used by more than 1.2 billion people every day, condemned the accused killer’s action. “This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,” said a spokesperson for the company. “We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.” It is not the first time a serious crime has been posted on Facebook. In January, four black people in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled white man and broadcasting the assault on the service while making anti-white racial taunts.  A month later, the suspects pleaded not guilty to assaulting the man. "

2017-11-21,5,"The move pits Shenzhen-based Tencent against rival Alibaba Group as they scramble for new growth opportunities outside China. Tencent this week became the first Asian firm to enter the club of companies worth more than $500 billion, and on Tuesday surpassed Facebook in market value.  “Malaysia is actually quite large in the sense that we have 20 million WeChat users, huge potential, and the market is quite warm towards internet products from China,” Lau said. Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and some of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has been a key battleground for China’s tech titans fighting for deals. Ethnic Chinese make up more than a fifth of Malaysia’s population. WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay, which dominate China’s digital payment market, have sought to expand their global footprint, although that push has so far been limited to payment services for Chinese outbound tourists. They can scan-and-pay for purchases in 34 countries or regions via Alipay and 13 via WeChat Pay, according to the companies. Alipay’s parent company Ant Financial has joint ventures in seven markets for local digital payments services, which operate independently under the partnerships’ brand names. Alibaba is looking to build a global payment system, while Tencent is more interested in generating traffic for WeChat - two different strategies, some bankers and investors say. WeChat has more users, but Alipay’s aggregate transaction volume is higher, according to JP Morgan’s John Hall, though other investors note that WeChat Pay can also process large transactions if it’s used on e-commerce platforms. Tencent is “not in a hurry” to speed up its overseas expansion or increase the monetization rate of its digital assets, Lau said. “We walk our own path at our own pace ... and, to be honest, there is really quite a lot to do in China,” he said. WeChat, which has ballooned from a messaging app to an all-in-one platform with 980 million monthly active users, could be the “killer product” to spearhead expansion abroad, Lau said, as its embedded payment function draws more services. “Honour of Kings”, Tencent’s top-grossing battle game that led an 84 percent increase in quarterly smartphone gaming revenue, also owes its success to the network help of WeChat, and is expected to find it tougher to crack Western markets, analysts say. Tencent this month delayed the launch of the game’s U.S. edition, “Arena of Valor”, to next year to “further polish additional gameplay and social features”. After games and social media, most of Tencent’s other businesses are in digital content, including Spotify equivalent Tencent Music and YouTube equivalent Tencent Video, which also makes its own dramas. “What we’re aiming to create is ‘super IPs’ (intellectual property) that leverage our different businesses from upstream to downstream,” Lau said, citing Disneyland and the James Bond movies as successful practices in the West. A big business for Tencent’s recently listed publishing arm, China Literature, is to sell its popular novels and have them turned into dramas and video games by Tencent’s other business lines. Tencent this month announced a plan involving 10 billion yuan ($1.51 billion) of investment to boost its creative content ecosystem, though it gave no time frame for the investment. Company president Martin Lau - no relation to S.Y. - said on an earnings call last week that Tencent would keep investing in digital content, especially online video, to draw more time from more paying customers. Overseas acquisitions will remain a key way of enhancing Tencent’s global access and competitiveness, S.Y. Lau said. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor said Tencent’s 2016 acquisition of Supercell gave it a strong position in gaming, while the move to buy a stake in social media firm Snapchat is another piece in the jigsaw. “It increasingly looks as if Tencent is embarking on a circumnavigation of the digital life pie in order to build an ecosystem to challenge the Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook dominance of consumer digital services,” he said, noting it’s at a “super early stage” in that process. Tencent will likely seek more overseas acquisitions, Windsor added, which, beyond being expensive, could challenge Tencent in integrating all its digital assets at home and abroad. Tencent has struggled to monetize its dominance over the Chinese digital life, he said, adding that’s why he sees more upside in Tencent’s market valuation, and prefers it to Alibaba. "

2017-04-17,-9,"“Our reach now is basically all over this country,” Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told a news conference in Ohio’s second-largest city. The shooting marked the latest video clip of a violent crime to turn up on Facebook, raising questions about how the world’s biggest social media network moderates content. The company on Monday said it would begin reviewing how it monitors violent footage and other objectionable material in response to the killing. Meanwhile, a reward of $50,000 was being offered for information regarding Stephens’ location, officials said.  Police said Stephens used Facebook Inc’s service to post video of him killing Robert Godwin Sr., 74, who is seen standing on a sidewalk carrying a plastic shopping bag as the suspect gets out of his car and approaches him from the street. “Hi, can you do me a favor? Can you say, ‘Joy Lane?'” the suspect asks Godwin, referring to a woman authorities have identified as Stephen’s former girlfriend. The elderly man, looking bewildered, asks, “Joy Lane?” and the suspect is heard replying, “Yeah. She’s the reason why this is about to happen to you.” He then asks Godwin his age before gunning him down.  Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin, a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed. Lane, in a text message to CBS News commenting on the shooting, said she was “sorry that all of this has happened.” She went on to describe Stephens as having been “kind and loving to me and my children,” adding, “This is a very difficult time for me and my family.” Reuters was not able to reach Lane by phone or email for comment. “As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible,” Justin Osofsky, a Facebook vice president, said in a blog post.  Stephens, who has no prior criminal record, is not suspected in any other murders, despite a claim he made in the video of having killed more than a dozen other people, police said. “To be honest, we’ve interviewed several people involved in this and I don’t think there is any rhyme or reason for it happening,” Williams said.  The last confirmed sighting of Stephens was at the scene of the homicide. Police said he might be driving a white or cream-colored Ford Fusion, and asked anyone who spots him or his car to call police or a special FBI hotline (800-CALLFBI). Stephens had worked since 2008 as a vocational specialist and youth mentor at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency located outside Cleveland. Beech Brook’s offices were closed on Monday. "

Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” Foreign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country’s military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against “Western anti-China forces.” China, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. Though Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, NYT said. Facebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. There is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said.

However, he said investment in the business should benefit Facebook in the longer term. “We have been down this road before with Facebook, they have invested something like this in mobile and we have seen it pay off. So we are looking at it as an opportunity,” said Olson.  Facebook shares were down 7 percent in after-hours trading, at $118.21. Mobile ads accounted for 84 percent of Facebook’s total advertising revenue of $6.82 billion in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared with 78 percent a year earlier. The company said it surpassed one billion mobile-only monthly users last quarter. The company is also reaping the benefits of a big push into video, both on Facebook itself and on the Instagram photo app. Founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts that the company was pursuing a video-first strategy across its entire family of apps, touting rapid expansion in Facebook’s live video feature. The company’s quarterly earnings announced on Wednesday marked the sixth straight time it posted revenue numbers that beat expectations.  Facebook reported quarterly revenue of $7.01 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $6.92 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected 97 cents per share. Facebook said about 1.79 billion people were using the service monthly as of Sept. 30, up 16 percent, or 243 million, from a year earlier. By comparison, the 10-year-old Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) last week reported it had 317 million monthly users in total. But Facebook still has numerous avenues for developing new revenue streams. Its WhatsApp messaging app, with more than a billion users, currently generates little revenue, as do newer products such as the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Facebook also aims to continue to grow its massive user base, especially in developing nations where the service currently has smaller penetration rates. Wehner pointed to the Asia-Pacific region as an area that continued to be promising for future user growth, echoing comments he made to Reuters in July. Zuckerberg said that 40 million people now used Internet.org, the company’s free mobile internet service, to get online, up from 15 million last year. The company said it hired 1,200 employees in the last quarter, boosting its total workforce to 15,700. "

2017-02-20,-3,"These efforts, which are aimed at developing hardware and so-called augmented reality technologies, are central to the strategy of a company that is seeking a valuation of up to $22 billion in its early March IPO despite heavy losses and the specter of stiff competition for advertising dollars with a far-larger Facebook. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2kXZxA7) It is a big gamble and the odds against Snap are long. There is little precedent for a company with its roots in software and social networking succeeding in the notoriously difficult consumer hardware business. Few U.S. firms aside from Apple (AAPL.O)  have made big profits on hardware, and camera and wearable gadget makers have much lower valuations than Snap is seeking. Once-hot camera start-up GoPro (GPRO.O) is a cautionary tale: its stock sits 61 percent below its 2014 IPO price.  More broadly, creating new products and features that have mass-market appeal and cannot be readily mimicked is a huge challenge, analysts say. ”It’s worrisome,” said Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at Sloy, Dahl & Holst, which manages more than $1 billion in assets. “Snapchat is going to have to continue to be really innovative and distinctive. It’s going to be very tough to trump Facebook.” Snap declined to comment for this story. Snap first signaled its new focus with the September reveal of Spectacles, funky sunglasses with an embedded video camera for posting to the Snapchat app. The company spent $184 million on research and development last year, nearly half its revenue. Augmented reality, which refers to computer-generated images overlaid on real surroundings and viewed through a smartphone or special glasses, is a big part of the plan. Snap’s “lenses” image-overlay feature has been a hit, and gives Snap an advertising format that’s unique, at least for now.  “If you’re going to make the bet longer-term on Snap, you are betting they are going to come up with innovative products that Facebook can’t copy,” said Nabil Elsheshai, senior equity analyst at Thrivent Financial, who is considering whether to recommend that his firm buy Snap’s IPO. Facebook-owned Instagram last year rolled out a feature called Stories, modeled after Snapchat’s feature by the same name. Snapchat had about 100 million fewer downloads than Instagram in 2016, according to market research firm App Annie.  “Ultimately, that’s what advertisers are going to be looking at,” said Douglas Melsheimer, managing director at investment bank and consulting firm Bulger Partners. Snap, along with Facebook and host of online rivals ranging from Google to BuzzFeed, is capitalizing on the shift of video advertising dollars from traditional television to the internet. Hardware is part of the answer. Snap has recruited hardware experts from Apple, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Nest and Motorola, according to an analysis of LinkedIn profiles. One former employee described ample resources and support from management for the hand-picked hardware teams. Last spring, Snap set out to hire up to 300 hardware, augmented reality and virtual reality specialists in a single month, according to another former employee. It also set up Snap Labs, a group dedicated to working on secretive projects. Its members have reviewed acquisition targets in areas including wearable cameras, facial recognition and 3D scanning technology, according to people close to the discussions. Spectacles itself came from Snap’s acquisition of startup Vergence Labs in 2014. The sunglasses surprised even Snap’s earliest investors, who say hardware was not in Snap’s initial pitch to them.  “It was a disappearing messaging product, and that’s it,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, who made the initial venture investment into Snap. Like most Snap backers he lauded the Spectacles rollout. Snap has acquired at least 10 startups since 2014 according to firms tracking such deals, and M&A deal makers say Snap is one of the most active shoppers they have heard from. “AMAZON PASS” Snap’s R&D investment as a percentage of revenue is far higher than what Facebook or Twitter were spending before they went public. One result of that investment has been a wave of patent filings - about 46 total, according to research firm CB Insights.  They include eye-wear patents for Spectacles, as well as patents for photo and video-capture devices, and object and facial recognition, which is key to developing augmented reality technology. One former employee said Snap is working to figure out ways to turn the warehouse of data it collects from Memories, a feature for users to save photos on Snap’s server, into augmented reality or facial recognition applications. Spectacles “opens the doors for augmented reality,” Elsheshai said. “That’s a different direction for the company than just adding more social media capabilities.”  The quirky popularity of Spectacles further endears users to Snapchat, he said, but doubted that such niche products can propel the user growth Snap needs in the long term. The greatest impediment to Snap’s innovation efforts, however, may be its hefty losses: the company lost $515 million last year on $404 million in sales. Revenue from Spectacles. was “not material,” according to Snap’s IPO filing. Snap, like Amazon.com, is expecting public investors to allow the company to lose money for years on the promise that more investment in innovation will pay off later. “They are going to have to get the Amazon pass - investors that don’t care in the short run,” Elsheshai said.

2016-11-21,2,"Social network firm Facebook said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as it gears up to open a new headquarters in London next year. Before the Brexit referendum in June, pro-Remain campaigners had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as withdrawing from the EU would make it a less attractive place to invest. But Facebook said on Monday that was not the case. “The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook’s story,” Europe, Middle East and Africa vice-president Nicola Mendelsohn will say at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, later on Monday. Facebook’s expansion comes after Google, owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest in thousands of extra engineers as part of its move to a new London building. Britain is also benefiting from the growth of online retailer Amazon, which expects to create 3,500 UK jobs in 2016, including at its head office, research and development centres, customer service centres and distribution depots. It plans a further 2,300 at three new distribution centres in 2017. Facebook said many of its new jobs would be in the high-skilled engineering sector. "

With Stories, Snap users string together photos and videos, embellish them and then post them to their feeds. Apple’s new Clips lets users post their video to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and more. But if users post them to Apple’s own Messages app, Apple will recommend whom to share it with based on which friends are in the videos and whom the user frequently contacts - the kind of predictive social features Facebook excels at. Apple has a huge number of users for Messages, the flagship app for short notes that is built into the iPhone’s iOS 10 software. Apple does not say how many people use the app, but it does say that there more than 1 billion iOS devices on the market and that 79 percent of them run iOS 10. Apple also says that Messages is the most commonly used app on iOS devices, giving the company potentially up to 800 million users for its latest messaging platform. Snap, by contrast, has 161 million daily active users. While Apple’s Clips competitor will technically be a separate app from Messages, it will be tied closely to it for the ability share Clips videos with other Apple users. Facebook has more than 1 billion users for both Messenger, which was split off from the main Facebook service in 2014, and for WhatsApp, which it acquired for $19 billion the same year.  Apple has been steadily matching the features of Facebook’s Messenger. But Apple is also walking a fine line with other messaging players, cooperating with them often as it competes with them.

2016-10-28,-31,"Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.  The social network has taken great pains to craft rules that can be applied uniformly with minimal discretion. The reversal on the war photo, however, shows how Facebook’s top executives sometimes overrule company policy and its legions of low- and mid-level content monitors. Facebook has often insisted that it is a technology company - not a media company - but an elite group of at least five senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls, particularly in high-profile controversies, eight current and former Facebook executives told Reuters. One of those key decision-makers - Justin Osofsky, who runs the community operations division - wrote a Facebook post acknowledging that the removal of the war photo was a ”mistake.” “Sometimes,” he wrote, “the global and historical significance of a photo like ‘Terror of War’ outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook.” Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen declined to comment on the company’s use of the photo in training sessions. Facebook has long resisted calls to publicly detail its policies and practices on censoring postings. That approach has drawn criticism from users who have had content removed and free-speech advocates, who cite a lack of transparency and a lack of an appeals process for many content decisions. At the same time, some governments and anti-terror groups are pressuring the company to remove more posts they consider offensive or dangerous. Another of the key decision-makers is Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert, who helped rule on the fracas over the war photo. “That was one we took a hard look at, and we decided it definitely belonged on the site,” said Bickert, a former federal prosecutor. She declined to elaborate on the decision-making process. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg followed up with an apology to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who had posted the photo on her own account after Facebook removed it from others in her country. In addition to Sandberg, Osofsky and Bickert, executives involved in sensitive content issues include Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s Washington-based government relations chief; and Elliot Schrage, the vice president for public policy and communications. All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard drop-out, occasionally gets involved with content controversies, Bickert said. These executives also weigh in on content policy changes meant to reflect shifting social context and political sensitivities around the world, current and former executives said. Facebook officials said the five people identified by Reuters were not the only ones involved in high-level content decisions. “Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand,” Chen said. Chen declined to name any other executives who were involved in content policy. Last month, Facebook disabled the accounts of editors at two of the most widely read Palestinian online publications, Shehab News Agency and Quds. In keeping with standard company practice, Facebook didn’t publicly offer a reason for the action or pinpoint any content it considered inappropriate. The company told Reuters that the removal was simply an error. Some Palestinian advocacy groups and media outlets condemned the shutdowns as censorship stemming from what they described as Facebook’s improper alliance with the Israeli government. Israel’s government has pushed Facebook to block hundreds of pages it believes incite violence against Jews, said Noam Sela, spokesman for Israeli cabinet Minister Gilad Erdan.  Sela said the Israeli government “had a connection” at Facebook to handle complaints but declined to elaborate on the relationship. “It’s not working as well as we would like,” Sela said. “We have more work to do to get Facebook to remove these pages.” Ezz al-Din al-Akhras, a Quds supervisor, said that Facebook’s head of policy in the Middle East had gotten in touch after the uproar over the shutdowns and that three of four suspended accounts were restored.  Facebook said the restoration of the accounts was not a response to complaints. It declined to comment on whether top executives were involved.  The company has cited technological glitches in other recent cases where content was removed, then restored, including the takedown of a video that showed the aftermath of a Minneapolis police shooting. Chen declined to explain the glitch. She said the company was reviewing its appeals process in response to public feedback. Facebook currently allows appeals of company actions involving entire profiles set up by people or institutions, or full pages on those profiles, but not for individual posts. These low-level staffers and contractors consult a thick rulebook that interprets the comparatively spare “community standards” that Facebook customers are asked to follow. The company trains front-line monitors to follow rules and use as little discretion as possible. When a removal sparks more complaints, regional managers function as a mid-level appeals court. Continuing controversy could then push the issue to top U.S. executives. Senior executives also weigh in on policy updates. Osofsky and Kaplan, for instance, wrote a blog post last week, in response to “continued feedback” on content removals, explaining that the company would start weighing news value more heavily in deciding whether to block content. In an earlier post, responding to the Napalm-girl controversy, Osofsky said Facebook’s policies usually work well, but not always. “In many cases, there’s no clear line between an image of nudity or violence that carries global and historic significance and one that doesn‘t,” Osofsky wrote. The Vietnam war photo - depicting horrors suffered by a girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc - was first removed from an account in Norway by a front-line monitor. In protest, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten printed the image on its front page and posted it on Facebook, which removed it. That prompted the prime minister to post the photo - only to have Facebook remove it again. Facebook then issued a statement defending the action, saying it was “difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.”  The next day, executives reversed the call, with Sandberg telling the prime minister: “Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging.” "

2016-11-21,1,"Before the Brexit referendum in June, campaigners in favor of remaining in the EU had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as a withdrawal from the bloc would make it a less attractive place to invest. Some big banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Citi (C.N), which employ many thousands in London’s financial center, are said to be considering shifting some jobs elsewhere in Europe as a result of Brexit, a worry for the British economy where financial services account for around 10 percent of output and provide some of the best paying jobs. Facebook’s UK expansion comes after Google (GOOGL.O), owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest an estimated 1 billion pounds, and make 3,000 new hires in the Britain. “The UK is definitely one of the very best places to be a technology company,” Facebook vice-president of Europe, Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn said at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, adding that it was too early to say what Brexit would mean for the movement of labor. “The movement of talent is something...that matters to us.” she said, adding that Facebook employs people of 65 different nationalities in Britain. Facebook opened its first engineering office outside the U.S. in London in 2012 and has been growing rapidly in the UK since. Its main UK operating unit’s staffing increased by 90 percent in 2015 from 2014, according to its latest accounts, with more than half of those hired engineers. It also employs hundreds of sales and marketing staff who tend to focus on larger clients or running regional teams, according to Facebook job ads and linkedIN profiles of staff. Amazon (AMZN.O), which created 3,500 UK jobs in 2016 at its head office, research and development centers, customer service centers and distribution depots, plans a further 2,300 jobs at three new distribution centers in 2017. A recent survey showed that three out of four companies with sales between 100 million pounds and 1 billion pounds have considered moving operations to the European continent in the wake of the vote. Mendelsohn said that Britain needed to work hard to keep its position as a global hub for technology.  “We need to make sure that we continue to look outwards and not inwards; we need to stay competitive, and we need to remain a welcome home to tech,” she said.  London ranked no.1 for start-ups in the 2016 European Digital City Index, and Google said the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation helped it decide to invest more in Britain, sentiments echoed by Mendelsohn.  “It’s a place that our engineers want to come and work at, it’s a place that we see this amazing ecosystem, not of just tech companies but also of creative companies coming together inspiring, fuelling one another,” she said. Facebook has a complex corporate structure for tax purposes and declared Dublin as its European headquarters which means almost no taxable profits are reported in the UK. It also has significant historic tax losses on its books, which means any cut in corporation tax would have little impact on its finances. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is reported to be considering cutting corporation tax from the 20 percent headline rate in a move to attract companies away from other parts of the EU to Britain. "

This claim/rumor is absolutely false,” Donnell Preskey, a spokeswoman for the department, said in an email.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other opponents say the pipeline threatens sacred sites and local water supplies. Supporters say it would be safer and more cost-effective than transporting oil by road or rail. The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline is being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP. The vast majority of new check-ins at the site in rural southwestern North Dakota appear to have been made remotely.  Ironically, using social media from the protest camp is hard due to poor cellphone reception. To get a signal, people walk up a small mound that has been dubbed “Facebook Hill.”  Variations on the search term “check in at Standing Rock” were among the most popular searches on Facebook on Monday afternoon, with more than 10,000 people talking about them. Mekasi Camp Horinek, a protest leader from Bold Oklahoma, an environmental advocacy group, said he did not know who started the online movement, but he welcomed it. “It is a lot of people showing their support for Standing Rock,” Horinek said on Monday by telephone from North Dakota. “They can’t be with us here physically, but they are with us in spirit and prayer.”  Horinek was among the 142 protesters arrested by police last week at an encampment set up on private land.

2016-10-28,-33,"By Kristina Cooke, Dan Levine and Dustin Volz SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - After Facebook’s removal of an iconic Vietnam war photo stirred an international uproar last month, the social network’s executives quickly backtracked and cleared its publication. But the image - showing a naked Vietnamese girl burned by napalm - had previously been used in training sessions as an example of a post that should be removed, two former Facebook employees told Reuters. Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.

Another of the key decision-makers is Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert, who helped rule on the fracas over the war photo. “That was one we took a hard look at, and we decided it definitely belonged on the site,” said Bickert, a former federal prosecutor. She declined to elaborate on the decision-making process. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg followed up with an apology to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who had posted the photo on her own account after Facebook removed it from others in her country. In addition to Sandberg, Osofsky and Bickert, executives involved in sensitive content issues include Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s Washington-based government relations chief; and Elliot Schrage, the vice president for public policy and communications. All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard drop-out, occasionally gets involved with content controversies, Bickert said. These executives also weigh in on content policy changes meant to reflect shifting social context and political sensitivities around the world, current and former executives said. Facebook officials said the five people identified by Reuters were not the only ones involved in high-level content decisions. “Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand,” Chen said. Chen declined to name any other executives who were involved in content policy. Last month, Facebook disabled the accounts of editors at two of the most widely read Palestinian online publications, Shehab News Agency and Quds. In keeping with standard company practice, Facebook didn’t publicly offer a reason for the action or pinpoint any content it considered inappropriate. The company told Reuters that the removal was simply an error. Some Palestinian advocacy groups and media outlets condemned the shutdowns as censorship stemming from what they described as Facebook’s improper alliance with the Israeli government. Israel’s government has pushed Facebook to block hundreds of pages it believes incite violence against Jews, said Noam Sela, spokesman for Israeli cabinet Minister Gilad Erdan. Sela said the Israeli government “had a connection” at Facebook to handle complaints but declined to elaborate on the relationship. “It’s not working as well as we would like,” Sela said. “We have more work to do to get Facebook to remove these pages.” Ezz al-Din al-Akhras, a Quds supervisor, said that Facebook’s head of policy in the Middle East had gotten in touch after the uproar over the shutdowns and that three of four suspended accounts were restored. “We hope the Facebook campaign of suspending and removing Palestinian accounts will stop,” he said. “We do not practice incitement; we are only conveying news from Palestine to the world.” Facebook said the restoration of the accounts was not a response to complaints. It declined to comment on whether top executives were involved. The company has cited technological glitches in other recent cases where content was removed, then restored, including the takedown of a video that showed the aftermath of a Minneapolis police shooting. Chen declined to explain the glitch. She said the company was reviewing its appeals process in response to public feedback. Facebook currently allows appeals of company actions involving entire profiles set up by people or institutions, or full pages on those profiles, but not for individual posts. These low-level staffers and contractors consult a thick rulebook that interprets the comparatively spare “community standards” that Facebook customers are asked to follow. The company trains front-line monitors to follow rules and use as little discretion as possible. When a removal sparks more complaints, regional managers function as a mid-level appeals court. Continuing controversy could then push the issue to top U.S. executives. Senior executives also weigh in on policy updates. Osofsky and Kaplan, for instance, wrote a blog post last week, in response to “continued feedback” on content removals, explaining that the company would start weighing news value more heavily in deciding whether to block content. In an earlier post, responding to the Napalm-girl controversy, Osofsky said Facebook’s policies usually work well, but not always. “In many cases, there’s no clear line between an image of nudity or violence that carries global and historic significance and one that doesn‘t,” Osofsky wrote. The Vietnam war photo - depicting horrors suffered by a girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc - was first removed from an account in Norway by a front-line monitor. In protest, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten printed the image on its front page and posted it on Facebook, which removed it. That prompted the prime minister to post the photo - only to have Facebook remove it again. Facebook then issued a statement defending the action, saying it was “difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.” The next day, executives reversed the call, with Sandberg telling the prime minister: “Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging.”   (Additional reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Joseph Menn in San Francisco, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Terje Solsvik in Oslo; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Brian Thevenot)"
2016-11-16,-4,"“We want to ensure our clients trust and believe in the metrics that we are providing,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global market solutions told Reuters. Getting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook’s continued revenue growth, as they fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads. Facebook, along with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and other large digital companies, has been criticized for a lack of transparency in how it measures the performance of videos.  Particularly, the lack of a universally agreed method of calculating how much time people are watching online video has been a sore spot for advertisers. Shares of Facebook were down 2.5 percent at $114.30 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In September, Facebook told advertisers that the average time users spent viewing online ads was artificially inflated, because it was only counting videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a “view.” Facebook left out those who watched for less than three seconds, or who did not watch the video at all, which gave advertisers the impression their videos were performing better than they really were. Since the admission and ensuing criticism from advertisers, Everson said Facebook has been in contact with clients and ad community trade groups, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Facebook also said on Wednesday it is in the process of forming what it called a ‘Measurement Council,’ which will include measurement experts from clients and ad agencies.  One of Facebook’s prominent advertisers, Swiss food and drink company Nestle SA (NESN.S), is already on board, Everson said, and the council should be up and running by early 2017.  The ANA, which represents Procter & Gamble Co, AT&T Inc and other major advertisers, has called on Facebook to get its metrics accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent media measurement audit group.  While Facebook’s internal metrics are not accredited by that group, it does use MRC-accredited third-party vendors, such as Nielsen and comScore, to help advertisers verify certain data.

2016-11-21,1,"Before the Brexit referendum in June, campaigners in favor of remaining in the EU had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as a withdrawal from the bloc would make it a less attractive place to invest. Some big banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Citi (C.N), which employ many thousands in London’s financial center, are said to be considering shifting some jobs elsewhere in Europe as a result of Brexit, a worry for the British economy where financial services account for around 10 percent of output and provide some of the best paying jobs. Facebook’s UK expansion comes after Google (GOOGL.O), owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest an estimated 1 billion pounds, and make 3,000 new hires in the Britain. “The UK is definitely one of the very best places to be a technology company,” Facebook vice-president of Europe, Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn said at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, adding that it was too early to say what Brexit would mean for the movement of labor. “The movement of talent is something...that matters to us.” she said, adding that Facebook employs people of 65 different nationalities in Britain. Facebook opened its first engineering office outside the U.S. in London in 2012 and has been growing rapidly in the UK since. Its main UK operating unit’s staffing increased by 90 percent in 2015 from 2014, according to its latest accounts, with more than half of those hired engineers. It also employs hundreds of sales and marketing staff who tend to focus on larger clients or running regional teams, according to Facebook job ads and linkedIN profiles of staff. Amazon (AMZN.O), which created 3,500 UK jobs in 2016 at its head office, research and development centers, customer service centers and distribution depots, plans a further 2,300 jobs at three new distribution centers in 2017. A recent survey showed that three out of four companies with sales between 100 million pounds and 1 billion pounds have considered moving operations to the European continent in the wake of the vote. Mendelsohn said that Britain needed to work hard to keep its position as a global hub for technology.  “We need to make sure that we continue to look outwards and not inwards; we need to stay competitive, and we need to remain a welcome home to tech,” she said.  London ranked no.1 for start-ups in the 2016 European Digital City Index, and Google said the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation helped it decide to invest more in Britain, sentiments echoed by Mendelsohn.  “It’s a place that our engineers want to come and work at, it’s a place that we see this amazing ecosystem, not of just tech companies but also of creative companies coming together inspiring, fuelling one another,” she said. Facebook has a complex corporate structure for tax purposes and declared Dublin as its European headquarters which means almost no taxable profits are reported in the UK. It also has significant historic tax losses on its books, which means any cut in corporation tax would have little impact on its finances. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is reported to be considering cutting corporation tax from the 20 percent headline rate in a move to attract companies away from other parts of the EU to Britain. "
2017-10-30,-6,"Facebook gave the details about the reach of Russian posts in written testimony the company provided to U.S. lawmakers which was seen by Reuters. Executives from Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google are scheduled to appear before three congressional committees this week on alleged Russian attempts to spread misinformation in the months before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said in the written testimony that the 80,000 posts from Russia’s Internet Research Agency were a tiny fraction of content on Facebook, equal to 1 out of 23,000 posts. The posts though violated Facebook’s terms of service and any amount of such activity using fake accounts is too much, Stretch wrote. “These actions run counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for.

2016-11-13,-14,"Zuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election  “crazy” at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news.  Such hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the election’s outcome, Zuckerberg said. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he said, noting the network’s goal is to “give every person a voice.” Still, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said. Facebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook.

2017-03-23,-52,"The Marines have a choice between two approaches to addressing the Marines United harassment. There’s a victim-centered approach – the model from tort law in which the injured party asserts a claim – or a risk-centered approach, which focuses on the larger-scale harms created. The victim-centered approach has been the traditional model of prosecuting sexual harassment; without the victim there is no prosecution. The choice of strategy will ultimately influence whether harassment in the military continues. Choosing the risk-centered approach will send a signal that the military is serious about combating the deliberate degradation of women in the armed forces.  READ MORE FROM REUTERS:Commentary: In legal battles against travel ban, Trump's own statements are his worst enemyCommentary: Trump wants to gut the State Department. Not everyone thinks that's a bad idea.Commentary: The futility of a Mexico-United States wall  In a victim-centered approach, the investigators and prosecutors would require the women in the photos to go through hours of questioning about their dating history and use of social media. The women would need to look at the pictures and read the sometimes violent comments directed against them. Investigators would use the women’s reports as the basis for the prosecution.  However, those who go through the reporting process will likely suffer a new round of harassment and injury – service-members who have reported sexual harassment in the past have described a culture of victim-blaming and shifting the investigation on to the person reporting, rather than keeping it focused on the perpetrator. They have found that little or no change has resulted from their efforts. And 62 percent of those who reported harassment experienced retaliation during their time in the service, through behaviors such as physical attack, lack of promotion and social isolation. This approach is unnecessarily burdensome and it's therefore not surprising that relatively few women have come forward in the Marines United case.  The Marines should instead use a risk-centered strategy that focuses on the national security risk created by the breakdown in military command and increased risk of blackmail. The Marines United group has violated military codes, undermined the authority of their commanders, and jeopardized the combat readiness of their units. And the Facebook group has created an entire network of blackmail targets. If the Marines are not already investigating it, then there’s a fair chance the Russians are.  Determining the extent of the national security risk will require investigators to identify the members of the Marines United group, which Marines were targeted by the photos, and where they fell in the chain of command. And it’s all there in the Facebook data: investigators can discover who shared the photos, created the pages, and cheered it on by using a “like” button or making explicit comments.  The military has already identified 850 active duty and Reserve Marines involved. It should be able to take on the bigger data problem of examining all nodes of the group. Social network analysis is not new; it’s what the NSA was doing a decade ago in its investigation of terrorist networks.  This strategy has an advantage over the victim-centered approach, in which investigators would only be able to ask Facebook for details in relation to those specific photos or that person. By framing the investigation as one of national security and military command, the burden moves away from the victim and on to the actions of the Marines United group.  Investigators would not need to base their actions on the undetermined injuries of the victims. Instead, recognizing national security interests, investigators could use court orders and subpoenas to compel Facebook and group members to disclose personal identifiers without a single victim coming forward. The scope and task is similar to a racketeering investigation in which the investigator’s first job is to identify those involved in the illegal activity.  Some will say that the sharing of explicit photos, taken or shared without consent does not justify national security concerns or threaten a breakdown of military command. After all, they would argue, this practice is no different from sharing Polaroids in Vietnam or viewing porn on the internet.  But what happened here is different – Marines shared photos of Marines, their fellow Marines and commanders. It is not acceptable to identify and single them out for acts of violence or to implicitly approve of the photo-sharing by failing to report it. If a private physically attacks a major, he knows he is going to be court-martialed. If a private subjects his major to public humiliation, he should know that real consequences will follow.    By using the risk-centered approach, the military will send a message about the seriousness of the threats and risks created by the photo-sharing group. Sanctions that might be commensurate with mere privacy violations are too weak for violations of national security and military command.

Twitter’s revised estimate of how many Russia-linked accounts were on its service comes a month after an influential Democratic senator, Mark Warner, slammed it for what he called an insufficient investigation.  Twitter has suspended all 2,752 accounts that it tracked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, and it has given U.S. congressional investigators the account names, the source familiar with the company’s testimony said.  “State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for us - and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter said in written testimony, according to the source.

2017-03-16,-4,"A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump’s first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc , Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump’s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson’s order “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump’s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the “friend-of-the-court” brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump’s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment.

2017-09-07,-16,"The world’s largest social network was already under fire for how little transparency it provides about digital political ads. Voters, researchers and journalists cannot see many of the ads politicians and interest groups run on Facebook to target certain groups, nor can they discover who paid for them. Senator Mark Warner said Congress may need to update laws in order to make them consistent with rules governing television advertising. “An American can still figure out what the content is being used in TV advertising. You can go look at the ad,” Warner, of Virginia, said at a security conference.  “But in social media there is no such requirement. So, you know, we may need a legislative solution,” he said. A second Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said on Thursday that he supported regulating social media ads like TV ads.  U.S. intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 election campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Watchdog group Common Cause on Thursday filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission alleging that unknown foreign nationals made expenditures during the election in violation of American election law.  Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he believed what Facebook disclosed was “the tip of the iceberg” and that Twitter Inc and other tech companies should also examine the issue. Twitter declined to comment. Google, the search engine which also owns video-sharing website YouTube, said on Thursday it had seen no evidence of an ad campaign like the one Facebook disclosed.  Warner’s committee is among those investigating alleged Russian meddling and whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Facebook’s disclosure about Russian advertising created more questions than it answered, such as which candidates the ads supported and how savvy the targeting was, said David Lazer, a Northeastern University political scientist.  U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, although non-citizens may advertise on issues. Other ads fall into a legal gray area.  Online advertising offered by Facebook and other platforms such as Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s Google, though, often targets narrow, carefully constructed audiences based on factors such as age, political preference or interests. Facebook is especially valued by advertisers due to its targeting capabilities. Facebook and Google have, so far, declined to make political ads more transparent. They said on Thursday they were both open to reviewing specific congressional proposals.  Facebook also said it was continuing its investigation into possible nefarious activity.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after the November election that it was a “pretty crazy idea” to think false news stories on the network tilted the election.  Since then, though, the company and other tech firms have taken a series of steps to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots. Facebook in April released a report on “information operations” on the site, including some aimed at influencing the French election this past spring. The report on Wednesday expands on that and, for the first time, shows how paid advertising may have played a role in Russian influence efforts in the United States.   Much of the advertising on Facebook and Google is self-serve and can be easily ordered up through their websites. “You can, from anywhere in the world, advertise to the entire world through the platform,” said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University law professor. “It’s incredibly empowering, but it doesn’t have all the regulatory trappings that a medium like television has.” "

2017-09-07,-26,"Senator Mark Warner said Congress may need to update laws in order to make them consistent with rules governing television advertising, which is subject to higher disclosure requirements. Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the social media site during a two-year-period through May 2017. “An American can still figure out what the content is being used in TV advertising. You can go look at the ad,” Warner said at a security conference. “But in social media there is no such requirement. So, you know, we may need a legislative solution.” Facebook’s disclosure renewed questions about the extent of foreign meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies say there was a multi-pronged cyber-influence operation that included theft and leaks of Democratic emails, the spread of political hoaxes on social media and hacking attempts on state election systems, all ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to help Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. On Thursday, liberal advocacy group Common Cause filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Election Commision alleging that unknown foreign nationals made expenditures during the election in violation of American election law. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the suspected Russian placement of ads may have gone far beyond what Facebook disclosed, and that Twitter Inc and other tech companies should also examine the issue. His committee is among those investigating alleged meddling and whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Television has been the backbone of political advertising for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of commercials. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets. Online advertising offered by Facebook and other platforms such as Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s Google, though, often targets narrow, more carefully constructed audiences based on factors such as age, political preference or interests. Facebook is especially valued by advertisers due to the level of data it collects on users, meaning ads can be targeted with high levels of detail. Google, the search engine which also owns video-sharing website YouTube, said on Thursday it always monitors for abuse and that it had seen no evidence of an ad campaign like the one Facebook disclosed. Warner said he was hopeful social media companies would not oppose legislation. “Americans, when it comes to elections, ought to be able to know there is foreign-sponsored content coming into their electoral process,” he said. ‘TIP OF THE ICEBERG’ Facebook briefed U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday and turned over information about the ads to Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading his own investigation into alleged Russian interference, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. That information included copies of the ads and data about the buyers, the source said. Twitter is expected to brief congressional investigators soon on whether Russia used its advertising platform during the election, Warner told reporters. Twitter declined to comment. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after the election last November that accusations his platform was manipulated to spread “fake news” to hurt Clinton’s candidacy was “a pretty crazy idea.” Since then, Facebook and other tech firms have attempted to do more to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots. “In the case of Facebook, they denied that they were being used in any way. They didn’t do anything,” Warner said at the security conference. “But by the time of the French elections, Facebook was working with the French” and shut down 50,000 accounts, he added. Facebook’s briefing to lawmakers on Wednesday “was the tip of the iceberg,” Warner said.

2017-10-13,-21,"Congressional sources said this week that Facebook Inc has been slow to cooperate. The company and others have said they are turning over information, but also that they are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. On visits to Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, met with leaders of the House Intelligence Committee and said the company wanted to help investigators and would turn over more information. “Things happened on our platform that shouldn’t have happened” in the lead-up to the election, Sandberg told the Axios website on Thursday. So far, however, the congressional sources said investigators have found it hard to extract all the relevant information from Silicon Valley about alleged Russian activity. But the committees have so far seen no need to issue subpoenas for the data, the sources added. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc have faced a stream of recent revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election in favor of the Republican White House candidate, Donald Trump. Facebook disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive advertisements believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. The company has now shared with congressional investigators the ads, information on how they were paid for, and how they were targeted, a Facebook spokesman said. Sandberg told congressional investigators on Thursday that in addition to the ads, the company would provide the rest of the information from accounts linked to Russia, the spokesman said. The sources said investigators were also pressing Twitter, Google and other companies for similar data, and urging Twitter to conduct a more comprehensive search of its data banks. “We have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion,” a Google spokeswoman said, asked about the issue. “We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.” A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to an email requesting comment. “Twitter has likely not released all potentially relevant data to congressional investigators in part because of their policy requiring a court order and their track record of defending user privacy by fighting such requests,” Adam Sharp, former head of news and government at Twitter, said in an interview. Twitter engineers are trying to regenerate some of the lost data, and may be able to retrieve some of it, said a person familiar with the company’s technology. The use of social media platforms was part of what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was a broader Russian effort to meddle in the election campaign, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Several congressional committees, as well as special counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating Russian interference, including any potential collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Trump has denied any such collusion. ‘TROLL FACTORY’ In September, Facebook disclosed that it had evidence that an operation based in Russia had spent $100,000 on thousands of sponsored posts promoting divisive social and political messages in a two-year period through May 2017. Facebook said it believed the messages were likely bought by people in Russia before and after the 2016 election. Sources familiar with Facebook’s contacts with Congress said that as recently as July this year, company officials were denying the existence of any paid Russian messaging, and only later acknowledged that the company had found $100,000 in sponsored traffic linked to 478 Facebook accounts. The sources said investigators think the paid messaging was generated by a group called the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg. U.S. officials have called it a “troll factory” that creates false identities or copies real ones to spread real, skewed, and fake information for the Kremlin. Congressional sources said some of the Facebook messaging went to groups with seemingly legitimate names such as Heart of Texas, Defend the Second, and United Muslims of America, which they said all had as many as 250,000 followers. These groups now appear to have been bogus, or set up to look like legitimate political organizations, and investigators want to learn more about the groups, their followers, and their origins, the sources said. They said Facebook lawyers have argued that turning over additional data could compromise its promise of privacy to its users. However, congressional investigators say that if Russian messengers used fake identities, they would have no legal claims to privacy.

2017-09-13,-12,"Schiff’s committee is one of the main congressional panels investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including allegations that associates of President Donald Trump colluded with Moscow as it sought to boost his chances of winning the White House. Trump and the Russian administration deny interference or collusion. The investigations include looking into how Russian entities may have used social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to promote events and spread false news stories attacking Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Facebook said on Tuesday that some ads bought by Russians last year promoted events during the U.S. presidential campaign. The company said its takedown of what it last week called Russian-affiliated pages included shutting down “several promoted events.” [nL2N1LT2IT] “It certainly appears that the Russians were engaged in a multi-pronged approach in using social media, through paid advertising, through paid event organizing, through dissemination and amplification of false and negative stories,” Schiff said. He said the committee needed to hear from the companies in either classified or public settings, to assess how the Russians had used social media, how the companies had investigated on their own and what else needed to be done.

2016-11-15,-1,"The new video calling service will thus provide another means for people to communicate without fear of eavesdropping though WhatsApp does retain other data such as an individual’s  list of contacts.  WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said in an interview that video calls will be rolled out to 180 countries within hours after the feature is introduced at an event in India.  “We obviously try to be in tune with what our users want,” Koum said at the company’s unmarked Mountain View, California headquarters building. “We’re obsessed with making sure that voice and video work well even on low-end phones.” Koum told Reuters that improvements in phone cameras, battery life and bandwidth had made the service viable for a significant proportion of WhatsApp users, even those using inexpensive smartphones. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) offers its FaceTime video calls to iPhone users, and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype offers video calls  on multiple platforms. But WhatsApp has built a massive installed base of mobile customers and has been steadily adding more features to what began as a simple chat applications. Koum said Facebook has allowed WhatsApp to use its servers and bandwidth around the world for voice and now video. That support will help spread the souped-up WhatsApp much farther and faster, he said. But the corporate allegiance also has a price. After years of pledging that it would not share information about users with Facebook, which already has digital dossiers on its own 1.7 billion users, WhatsApp revised its privacy statement in August to say it would do exactly that. That means Facebook knows whom WhatsApp users contact and their phone numbers. Some users complained, but Koum said that he had not seen a shift in behavior. “In terms of security and privacy, what people care about the most is the privacy of their messages,” he said. The video service is well integrated and adds a few twists. Users can move around the thumbnail video showing what their correspondent sees and flick a video call in progress to the side to minimize it while checking texts or email. Koum said WhatsApp remained committed to security after the U.S. election of Donald Trump as president last week heightened fears of increased surveillance. Trump, along with some leading congressional Republicans and FBI Director James Comey, has advocated requiring tech companies to turn over customer information in many circumstances, a position which, if put into law, could require companies including WhatsApp to completely redesign their services. Other countries including China and the United Kingdom also take a dim view of encryption. But Koum said he not see a major threat to his service, noting that diplomats and officials use WhatsApp in many countries. “It would be like them shooting themselves in the foot.” "

2016-11-11,-14,"The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election this week has prompted questions over how much voters were swayed by inaccurate or misleading news items shared on Facebook, mostly in favor of Trump. Facebook will disable use of the advertising tool, called ‘ethnic affinities,’ for ads that offer housing, employment and the extension of credit; areas where certain groups have historically faced discrimination, Facebook said in a blog post.  ""There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote. (bit.ly/2eZ8Eey) Facebook collects vast amounts of data on its users, including photographs, allowing it to demographically categorize them in ways that allow advertisers to precisely target content to those they want to reach. The company said it will now use tools that automatically detect and disable ads offering housing, employment or credit that rely on ethnic affinity marketing, Egan said. It will also update its policies to more explicitly require advertisers to not engage in discriminatory advertising. The changes come two weeks after ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news organization, published an article showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude groups on the basis of ethnic affinities, a practice it said may violate federal housing and civil rights laws passed in the 1960s. A group of Facebook users filed a lawsuit against the company after the ProPublica report, claiming such ad targeting violated the Fair Housing Act and Civil Rights Act.  Facebook has attracted criticism in recent months for how it polices several forms of content for its 1.8 billion users, including extremist propaganda, nudity and misleading or inaccurate political articles, which have become known as ‘fake news.’ The company has been accused by some reporters, political observers and some in Silicon Valley of helping Trump win Tuesday’s election by doing little to limit the spread of such items, many from dubious websites, on its service. On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg rejected those claims.

2016-11-07,-1,"Facebook warned last week that revenue growth would slow this quarter because of “ad load,” or the number of ads that Facebook can put in front of customers without alienating them, offsetting strong earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates. Each outlet partnering with Facebook will publish a 15-minute live video centered on the presidential election in one of the 50 states. The content will be featured on Facebook’s “Election 2016” site on Tuesday and include the hashtag #50states. While Facebook is not selling ads on the Election Day livestreams, it could generate more visits to the site, bolstering its reputation as a destination for live news and pushing back against Twitter, where users often “live-tweet” major events. Asked whether the Facebook Live initiative was a response to the popularity of “live-tweeting” events among social media users, Jason White, manager of U.S. news media partnerships at Facebook, said Facebook Live was something that “works really well on our platform.” “I think for us we really wanted to give the news media and especially local (outlets) something to raly around on Election day,” said White, regarding the 50 States project.  He said the company is exploring the possibility of including advertising breaks in live video in the future but said that no specific plans had been made yet. Frank Mungeam, vice president of digital content for broadcast and digital media firm TEGNA, told Reuters that six of his company’s local broadcast stations, one each from Colorado, Washington state, Minnesota, Idaho, Maine and South Carolina, were participating. Mungeam, who said Facebook was not paying his company for the content, added: “Facebook’s platform offers an extended reach.” Twitter said last week its government-focused handle, @gov, would provide election information to users via direct message, while Snapchat on Sunday featured a photo filter encouraging people to vote. Facebook launched Facebook Live for selected public figures in 2015 and made it available to all users in April 2016, allowing members to broadcast video live from their smartphones. Social media sites have been seizing on live video content to attract users. In September, Twitter broadcast its first National Football League game, attracting generally positive feedback.

2017-09-13,-4,"Digital multinationals “minimize the overall tax burden in the EU by routing all revenues to low-tax member states such as Ireland and Luxembourg,” said the report, prepared by EU socialist lawmaker Paul Tang. The document focuses on the social network Facebook (FB.O) and search engine Google (GOOGL.O), now part of Alphabet, because the two U.S. companies book most of their EU revenues in low tax-rate Ireland, a move that allows them to pay in the EU much lower taxes than those they face in the rest of the world. It says that Google pays taxes worth up to 9 percent of its revenues outside the EU, but this ratio goes down to no more than 0.82 percent inside the EU. “Facebook’s taxes as a share of their revenues recorded outside the EU is between 28 percent and 34 percent, whereas in the EU this is a remarkably low ratio of 0.03 percent to 0.10 percent,” the report adds. This resulted in estimated revenue losses for EU states, other than Ireland, of between 51 and 54 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, the report concluded.  Tang is in charge of steering through the EU assembly a tax reform, known as common corporate tax base, which aims at harmonizing national tax deductions on business profits.  He plans to introduce an amendment that would force online multinationals to pay taxes in the EU countries where they are present with a “digital platform” that generates at least 5 million euros of annual turnover. Existing rules require online companies to pay taxes only where they have a physical presence and a tax residence, regardless of where they generate their profits. Tang’s amendment is similar to a proposal made by the Estonian presidency of the EU, and that will be discussed by EU finance ministers this week. If EU states decided to tax the revenues of digital companies, rather than their profits, as proposed by France with the backing of Germany, Italy and Spain, that could have generated 4 billion euros in tax revenues from Google and Facebook between 2013 and 2015 if a 5 percent rate was applied, the report estimated.  That measure would also force Amazon (AMZN.O) to pay taxes. The U.S. online retailer, with an EU tax residence in Luxembourg, has been mostly exempted from taxes in the 2013-2015 period because it did not make profits, the report said. "

2017-07-25,-15,"The authorities have the power to issue fines if the companies fail to comply. Twitter did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment and a Google spokesman declined to make immediate comment. Facebook said it believes that the company is compliant with EU law but recognised that its terms could be made easier to understand and would work to meet the authorities’ concerns. The concerns centre mainly on procedures the social media companies proposed to set up for the removal of illegal content on their websites, terms limiting their liability and terms allowing them unilaterally to remove content posted by users. The U.S. trio were given until July 20 to submit new proposals, which need to be implemented by the end of September, the letters said. A person familiar with the matter said that two of the companies had submitted amended proposals, while a third had asked for more time, declining to specify which one. The companies had first proposed changes to their terms and conditions in March to assuage the regulators’ concerns in March. The sticking points were terms such as those that forced European consumers to seek redress in California, where the companies are based, instead of the consumer’s home country. U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy issues to how quickly they remove illegal or threatening content. The authorities and the Commission asked the companies to provide more detail on the timeframe and deadlines they would apply to dealing with notifications of content deemed illegal under consumer law, as well as dedicating a page or email address to notifications from consumer authorities. In addition, the bodies are pressing for a procedure whereby consumers would be notified before their content is removed or given an opportunity to challenge it. In the case of Alphabet’s Google unit, the concerns were about its social network Google+. "

Facebook fell 1.4 percent after the company said it expected expenses to jump between 45 percent and 60 percent next year. Tesla dipped 6.24 percent after the electric car maker pushed back its target for volume production on its new Model 3 sedan by about three months, and reported its biggest quarterly loss ever. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by losses in discretionary and technology stocks. After a one-day postponement, Republicans have made plans for a measure that will seek up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years but will likely not spell out completely how to offset them.

Trump is widely expected to nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell from a list that includes current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, Stanford University economist John Taylor, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. Powell has broadly supported Yellen’s monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concern that low inflation justified continuing with a cautious approach to raising interest rates. “I think a lot of it is priced in that Powell will be the choice. It’s the worst kept secret and it was done to not upset the market,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Trump will announce his choice at 3:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) at the White House, according to his public schedule.

2017-07-25,-8,"The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering tossing out 2015 Obama administration net neutrality rules that reclassified internet service like a public utility. The current rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for “fast lanes” over competitors. Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the rules. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet. The outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved. Other chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Several companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify. Comcast said it welcomed the hearing and “believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.” ”A strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it’s time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet,” said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. “The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.” Democrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the “largest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion,” said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation. A group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid “fast lanes.” Major internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place. More than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.”"
2016-11-03,0,"The social network may have forecast slowing revenue growth and higher investments next year, but it remains a strong long-term bet, according to an overwhelming majority of brokerages. Facebook’s third-quarter profit and revenue blew past analyst estimates on Wednesday. But that was not enough for some investors, who drove down the stock to around $120 on Thursday, its lowest since July. Investors appeared to be spooked by the company’s aggressive investment plans and a comment that limits on “ad load” would result in slower revenue growth in the current quarter. By “slower” Facebook means less than the 56 percent growth the company managed in the third quarter. Analysts also noted that Facebook’s comments on “ad load” and heavy investment in talent and data centers were not new and that there was nothing to suggest that the company’s spectacular run was coming to an end. Ad loads are the number of ads that can be displayed to customers without alienating them. The issue is particularly important for Facebook since 90 percent of its users access the social network through mobile devices. Facebook said aggressive investment would continue in 2017. “Clearly the market is spooked by FB’s 2017 commentary, but there was nothing new and certainly not anything that the market didn’t eventually expect to hear,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil said in a client note. Of 49 brokerages covering Facebook, 45 have a “buy” or higher rating on the stock. Facebook had said after its second-quarter results that it expected lower ad revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016 as ad load would grow only modestly. Facebook has beaten revenue estimates for all three quarters this year, propelled by strong ad sales growth. “There’s no doubt the business is performing much better than expected ... and we think FB is just trying to keep expectations in check as we head into 2017,” Patil said. Up to Wednesday’s close, Facebook’s shares had risen more than 21 percent since the start of the year. That has made the stock pricey. Facebook’s stock trades at nearly 34 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O),  23 times and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) 13.5. Google, whose advertising revenue increased 18 percent in the quarter, is Facebook’s chief rival for ad dollars. “There are several consumer and ad innovations that should keep advertiser demand high (for Facebook),” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham. “We believe Facebook’s operating momentum, high growth and reasonable valuation continue to suggest it should be a core tech holding.” "
2016-11-03,-11,"The lawsuit was one of dozens targeting Facebook, the banks and others after the Menlo Park, California-based company’s $16 billion IPO suffered from technical glitches and its stock price slid 54 percent within four months. Lowinger accused Facebook of concealing pessimistic internal growth projections from the public even as it quietly alerted the banks, who then passed the news to top clients and bet successfully against the stock. He sought to force the banks to turn their profits over to Facebook. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit in May 2014, saying the lock-up agreements restricting insiders from selling stock were standard in the industry. Upholding that ruling on Thursday, Circuit Judge Ralph Winter said subjecting bank underwriters to similar restrictions would “complicate” their role, add millions of dollars of legal exposure and reduce the number of companies going public. “IPOs contemplate the sharing of confidential financial information with underwriters, agreements between underwriters and large pre-IPO shareholders limiting disposal of their shares, and trading by underwriters in the course of the offering,” he wrote. “Far from being nefarious, these actions benefit existing shareholders and new public investors.” Jeffrey Abraham, a lawyer for Lowinger, declined to comment. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony, Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney and Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan declined to comment. Judge Sweet oversees separate class-action litigation against Facebook by retail and institutional investors who claim they overpaid for the company’s shares. Facebook’s share price has more than tripled from the $38 IPO price, despite the initial decline. The gains have made Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg the world’s fifth-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. The case is Lowinger v Morgan Stanley & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3800. "
2016-11-04,-20,"Facebook’s rules forbid bullying, harassment and threatening language, but critics say it does not do enough to enforce them and has failed to staunch a tide of racist and threatening posts on the social network during an influx of migrants into Europe. Prosecutors in Hamburg earlier this year rejected a similar complaint by Jun on the grounds that the regional court lacked jurisdiction because Facebook’s European operations are based in Ireland. “There is a different view in Bavaria,” his firm Jun Lawyers of Wuerzburg in Bavaria said in a statement. “Upon Jun’s request, Bavarian Justice Minister Winfried Bausback said that Hamburg’s view was wrong and German law does indeed apply to some of the offences,” it said. Jun’s complaint named Facebook founder and chief executive Zuckerberg and nine other managers at the company, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Facebook said it had not violated German law and was working on fighting hate speech online.  “We are not commenting on the status of a possible investigation but we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees,” a company spokesman said. Jun has compiled a list of 438 postings that were flagged as inappropriate but not deleted over the past year. They include  what some might consider merely angry political rants but also clear examples of racist hate speech and calls to violence laced with references to Nazi-era genocide. Following a public outcry and pressure from German politicians, Facebook this year hired Arvato, a business services unit of Bertelsmann, to monitor and delete racist posts. A rash of online abuse and violent attacks against newcomers to Germany accompanied the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants last year, which led to a rise in the popularity of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and has put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet. The outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved. Other chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Several companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify. Comcast said it welcomed the hearing and “believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.” ”A strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it’s time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet,” said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. “The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.” Democrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the “largest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion,” said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation. A group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid “fast lanes.” Major internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place. More than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.” "
2016-11-02,-3,"British newspapers said earlier on Wednesday the insurer would analyse Facebook accounts of new drivers for personality traits which show a cautious nature, such as writing lists and arranging a set time and place to meet friends. Insurers say examining social media could improve the pricing of policies, but critics say this could erode customers’ privacy. Admiral’s firstcarquote app was designed to allow new drivers to share social media data in order to get a discounted quote. “Following discussions with Facebook, the product is launching with reduced functionality, allowing first time drivers to log-in using Facebook and share some information to secure a faster, simpler and discounted quote,” the spokeswoman said by email. “Admiral does not have access to customers’ Facebook data and does not hold social media data to set prices for its customers.” Facebook bans the use of its data on apps to make decisions about “eligibility”, such as how much interest to charge on a loan. “Protecting the privacy of the people on Facebook is of utmost importance to us,” a Facebook spokesman said by email. “We have made sure anyone using this app is protected by our guidelines and that no Facebook user data is used to assess their eligibility. Facebook accounts will only be used for log-in and verification purposes.” Steep insurance premiums for young drivers in the UK have encouraged the use of technology to cut prices, such as telematics - black boxes installed in cars to monitor safe driving. Some UK insurers also monitor public social media data to help them identify fraudulent claims, industry sources say."
2016-11-03,0,"The social network may have forecast slowing revenue growth and higher investments next year, but it remains a strong long-term bet, according to an overwhelming majority of brokerages. Facebook’s third-quarter profit and revenue blew past analyst estimates on Wednesday. But that was not enough for some investors, who drove down the stock to around $120 on Thursday, its lowest since July. Investors appeared to be spooked by the company’s aggressive investment plans and a comment that limits on “ad load” would result in slower revenue growth in the current quarter. By “slower” Facebook means less than the 56 percent growth the company managed in the third quarter. Analysts also noted that Facebook’s comments on “ad load” and heavy investment in talent and data centers were not new and that there was nothing to suggest that the company’s spectacular run was coming to an end. Ad loads are the number of ads that can be displayed to customers without alienating them. The issue is particularly important for Facebook since 90 percent of its users access the social network through mobile devices. Facebook said aggressive investment would continue in 2017. “Clearly the market is spooked by FB’s 2017 commentary, but there was nothing new and certainly not anything that the market didn’t eventually expect to hear,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil said in a client note. Of 49 brokerages covering Facebook, 45 have a “buy” or higher rating on the stock. Facebook had said after its second-quarter results that it expected lower ad revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016 as ad load would grow only modestly. Facebook has beaten revenue estimates for all three quarters this year, propelled by strong ad sales growth. “There’s no doubt the business is performing much better than expected ... and we think FB is just trying to keep expectations in check as we head into 2017,” Patil said. Up to Wednesday’s close, Facebook’s shares had risen more than 21 percent since the start of the year. That has made the stock pricey. Facebook’s stock trades at nearly 34 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O),  23 times and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) 13.5. Google, whose advertising revenue increased 18 percent in the quarter, is Facebook’s chief rival for ad dollars. “There are several consumer and ad innovations that should keep advertiser demand high (for Facebook),” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham. “We believe Facebook’s operating momentum, high growth and reasonable valuation continue to suggest it should be a core tech holding.” "
2016-11-03,-12,"By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected a claim by Facebook shareholder Robert Lowinger that “lock-up” agreements forbade the sales because the banks and selling shareholders together formed a “group” owning more than 10 percent of the social media company’s stock. The lawsuit was one of dozens targeting Facebook, the banks and others after the Menlo Park, California-based company’s $16 billion IPO suffered from technical glitches and its stock price slid 54 percent within four months. Lowinger accused Facebook of concealing pessimistic internal growth projections from the public even as it quietly alerted the banks, who then passed the news to top clients and bet successfully against the stock. He sought to force the banks to turn their profits over to Facebook. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit in May 2014, saying the lock-up agreements restricting insiders from selling stock were standard in the industry. Upholding that ruling on Thursday, Circuit Judge Ralph Winter said subjecting bank underwriters to similar restrictions would “complicate” their role, add millions of dollars of legal exposure and reduce the number of companies going public. “IPOs contemplate the sharing of confidential financial information with underwriters, agreements between underwriters and large pre-IPO shareholders limiting disposal of their shares, and trading by underwriters in the course of the offering,” he wrote. “Far from being nefarious, these actions benefit existing shareholders and new public investors.” Jeffrey Abraham, a lawyer for Lowinger, declined to comment. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony, Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney and Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan declined to comment. Judge Sweet oversees separate class-action litigation against Facebook by retail and institutional investors who claim they overpaid for the company’s shares. Facebook’s share price has more than tripled from the $38 IPO price, despite the initial decline. The gains have made Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg the world’s fifth-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. The case is Lowinger v Morgan Stanley & Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3800."

2016-11-02,1,"Facebook reported a greater-than-expected 56 percent rise in quarterly revenue, to $7.01 billion, showing the company is claiming an ever-growing share of the online advertising pie.  Google’s parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) last week also announced strong revenue and profit growth, while traditional media companies like the New York Times Co (NYT.N) are struggling to stem ad revenue declines. However, in a call with analysts, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said ad growth would likely slow “meaningfully” due to limits on “ad load,” or the number of ads that Facebook can put in front of customers without alienating them.  He also said 2017 would be a year of aggressive investment with a substantial increase in expenses. “They have reached the limit of the ad frequency on news feed, so they are going to have to find revenue growth from other areas like pricing, user engagement, user base growth,” said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.  However, he said investment in the business should benefit Facebook in the longer term. “We have been down this road before with Facebook, they have invested something like this in mobile and we have seen it pay off. So we are looking at it as an opportunity,” said Olson.  Facebook shares were down 7 percent in after-hours trading, at $118.21. Mobile ads accounted for 84 percent of Facebook’s total advertising revenue of $6.82 billion in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared with 78 percent a year earlier. The company said it surpassed one billion mobile-only monthly users last quarter. The company is also reaping the benefits of a big push into video, both on Facebook itself and on the Instagram photo app. Founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts that the company was pursuing a video-first strategy across its entire family of apps, touting rapid expansion in Facebook’s live video feature. The company’s quarterly earnings announced on Wednesday marked the sixth straight time it posted revenue numbers that beat expectations.  Facebook reported quarterly revenue of $7.01 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $6.92 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected 97 cents per share. Facebook said about 1.79 billion people were using the service monthly as of Sept. 30, up 16 percent, or 243 million, from a year earlier. By comparison, the 10-year-old Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) last week reported it had 317 million monthly users in total. But Facebook still has numerous avenues for developing new revenue streams. Its WhatsApp messaging app, with more than a billion users, currently generates little revenue, as do newer products such as the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Facebook also aims to continue to grow its massive user base, especially in developing nations where the service currently has smaller penetration rates. Wehner pointed to the Asia-Pacific region as an area that continued to be promising for future user growth, echoing comments he made to Reuters in July. Zuckerberg said that 40 million people now used Internet.org, the company’s free mobile internet service, to get online, up from 15 million last year. The company said it hired 1,200 employees in the last quarter, boosting its total workforce to 15,700. "

2016-10-31,-18,"By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - More than 70 rights groups asked Facebook on Monday to clarify its policies for removing content, especially at the behest of governments, alleging the company has repeatedly censored postings that document human rights violations. In a letter sent to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, the organizations criticize the social media company for cases in recent months where it has deleted content involving police violence, removed iconic imagery from the Vietnam War and briefly suspended accounts belonging to two Palestinian journalists. “News is not just getting shared on Facebook: it’s getting broken there,” read the letter, whose signatories include the American Civil Liberties Union, Sierra Club, Center for Media Justice and SumOfUs. “When the most vulnerable members of society turn to your platform to document and share experiences of injustice, Facebook is morally obligated to protect that speech,” it continued.

2016-11-03,-17,"(Reuters Health) - Social media is an important source of news for many Americans, but the health stories that are most popular may also be the least accurate, suggests a study of Facebook posts about Zika virus. In May and June 2016, a period of heavy media coverage of the Zika virus epidemic spreading in the Americas, about four out of five popular posts on Facebook about Zika contained accurate information, researchers found. But the ones containing inaccurate information or conspiracy theories were far more popular on the social networking website. “What was most disturbing to me was the websites or videos that are giving this misinformation are trying to take the focus completely away from the issue,” said lead author Dr. Megha Sharma, a neonatal-perinatal medicine fellow at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Those inaccurate posts may lead people to disregard accurate information about Zika virus from organizations like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO), Sharma told Reuters Health. In February 2016, Zika virus was actively transmitted in 30 countries, most in the Americas, according to CDC, and WHO declared the outbreak to be “of international concern.” By late May, the tally of countries with Zika transmission was up to 48.  Zika infections in pregnant women have been shown to cause microcephaly - a severe birth defect in which the head and brain are undersized - as well as other brain abnormalities. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 2,000 cases of microcephaly. In adults, Zika infections have also been linked to a rare neurological syndrome known as Guillain-Barre, as well as other neurological disorders.  For the new study, Sharma and her colleagues searched Facebook over one week in late June for the words Zika and virus. They then selected the 200 most popular posts from the previous month and analyzed their content. Popularity was determined by various factors, including the number of views and shares, and number of supportive comments. The researchers report in the American Journal of Infection Control that 81 percent of the top-200 most popular posts and videos on Facebook contained useful or credible information about Zika virus. Most useful posts came from news agencies, and 22 useful videos were attributed to the CDC. About 12 percent of the posts were classified as misleading. Most of those posts suggested that Zika virus was a way to depopulate developing nations or called the entire disease a hoax. While most of the 200 posts contained useful and credible information, the researchers found that those spreading conspiracy theories or misinformation were most popular. The most shared credible and useful post, for example, was a video of a WHO press briefing that was viewed 43,000 times and shared by 964 Facebook accounts. The most popular post spreading misinformation claimed Zika virus is a “fraudulent medical hoax” and was viewed over 530,000 times. That post was also shared by more than 19,600 people. “A lot of this has to do with how information is presented,” Sharma said. Websites that create posts with misinformation are often more “in your face” than those posts from the CDC and WHO, she added. “I understand that this is a very hard issue to deal with because there has to be freedom of speech and impression on social media,” Sharma said. There may be a way for social media websites to display more relevant health information, she added. Deciding what information is and is not credible would be difficult for Facebook to scale to its entire network, said Ceren Budak, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information in Ann Arbor. Budak, who wasn’t involved in the new study, researched how to combat online misinformation. She approached it as a math problem, and found it’s possible if a person or organization targets the right people with the correct information. Timing is key, however. “If you’re too late, it’s hard for you to catch up and combat (misinformation),” Budak told Reuters Health. “The exact solution is very complex,” she said. Budak also said the new study may underestimate the spread of misinformation since it only evaluated popular posts. Some research suggests the spread of misinformation by people online is much greater than what the new study shows. “They just don’t really check the credibility of the information,” she said. “They receive and just share it right away.”  Sharma said about two-thirds of U.S. adults use Facebook and many get their news from the website. She suggests people follow reliable social media channels like the CDC and WHO, and be more skeptical of other kinds of videos posted online.

2016-10-31,-8,"Only a month ago, the company and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg came into conflict after Facebook deleted the photo of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack, called “The Terror of War”. Solberg posted the photograph on her Facebook page after the company had deleted it from the sites of a Norwegian author and the newspaper Aftenposten, which mounted a front-page campaign urging Facebook to permit publication. “We have made a number of policy changes after The Terror of War photo. We have improved our escalation process to ensure that controversial stories and images get surfaced more quickly,” said Patrick Walker, Facebook’s director of media partnership for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “(And) in the weeks ahead, we are going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if they might otherwise violate our standards,” Walker told a meeting of the Association of Norwegian Editors in Oslo, to which he was invited following the row. “Our intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them,” they wrote. On Monday, Walker told Reuters Facebook was at the beginning of the process of changing its guidelines and could not give further details.  To the audience of journalists, the Facebook executive said the company had to have global standards of content as it was mindful that content, such as nudity, that was acceptable in one country may not be acceptable in another. Many were left unconvinced after the debate. “Facebook is trying to isolate this as a question of rules about nudity, about being careful. But this is not the question I am raising,” Espen Egil Hansen, the editor-in-chief of Aftenposten, told Reuters.  “The question is whether they now have such a dominant role in distributing information and news that they are becoming a threat against important democratic processes.” "
2016-11-23,1,"Zuckerberg in March met China’s propaganda chief Liu Yunshan who said he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China’s internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  “However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” The Cybersecurity Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China’s foreign ministry declined to comment.   China, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. Facebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. There is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. Facebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates.

2017-01-13,-13,"Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old refugee from Damascus, was pictured in September 2015 taking a selfie with Merkel during her visit to a refugee shelter in Berlin’s Spandau district.  The image came to define Germany’s response to the refugee crisis, when Merkel opened the country’s borders to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers. But in the following months Modamani’s image was shared on Facebook on a series of anonymous accounts, alongside posts claiming he was responsible for militant attacks and murder, including the Brussels Airport bombing of March 2016. Facebook has repeatedly refused to take the posts down, saying they do not violate the company’s rules, Modamani’s lawyer said. “Whenever something happens in the news related to refugees, his picture reappears,” Modamani’s lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Facebook could not be reached immediately for comment by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  A Facebook spokesperson told Britain’s Guardian newspaper they had received a takedown request from Jun “alleging that a specific item of content on our platform violates Mr Modamani’s right of personality”.  “Access to that reported content was quickly disabled, so we do not believe there is any basis for him to seek an injunction,” the spokesperson said. One post falsely linked Modamani to an incident in Berlin last month, when a group set fire to a sleeping homeless man on a train station platform, Jun said. The post was shared 500 times and was likely to have been seen by at least 25,000 people, he said. Jun filed a preliminary injunction against Facebook Europe in December, and a court hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6 in Wurzburg, southern Germany, he said. The case comes as Germany’s justice ministry considers new policies to crack down on fake news by making Facebook and other social media companies criminally liable for failing to remove hate speech.  Facebook should be treated as a media company rather than a technology company, the justice minister said in November. Modamani now works in a fast-food restaurant in Berlin, his lawyer said. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced a series of measures in November to stem a flood of “fake news” articles in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. He said Facebook would make it easier for users to report fake news, and more difficult for fake news providers to make money through its advertising system. "
2016-10-31,-11,"The local sheriff’s department denied it is using social media to keep tabs on demonstrators, and said the online actions by the protesters’ supporters were unnecessary. “The Morton County Sheriff’s Department is not and does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location. This claim/rumor is absolutely false,” Donnell Preskey, a spokeswoman for the department, said in an email.  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other opponents say the pipeline threatens sacred sites and local water supplies. Supporters say it would be safer and more cost-effective than transporting oil by road or rail. The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline is being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP. The vast majority of new check-ins at the site in rural southwestern North Dakota appear to have been made remotely.  Ironically, using social media from the protest camp is hard due to poor cellphone reception. To get a signal, people walk up a small mound that has been dubbed “Facebook Hill.”  Variations on the search term “check in at Standing Rock” were among the most popular searches on Facebook on Monday afternoon, with more than 10,000 people talking about them. Mekasi Camp Horinek, a protest leader from Bold Oklahoma, an environmental advocacy group, said he did not know who started the online movement, but he welcomed it. “It is a lot of people showing their support for Standing Rock,” Horinek said on Monday by telephone from North Dakota. “They can’t be with us here physically, but they are with us in spirit and prayer.”  Horinek was among the 142 protesters arrested by police last week at an encampment set up on private land. There were also demonstrations at banks linked to the pipeline’s financing on Monday. Twelve people were arrested in San Francisco for demonstrating in the Citigroup Center, according to protest organizers, and demonstrators occupied the lobby of the Wells Fargo Center in Salt Lake City.

The image came to define Germany’s response to the refugee crisis, when Merkel opened the country’s borders to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers. But in the following months Modamani’s image was shared on Facebook on a series of anonymous accounts, alongside posts claiming he was responsible for militant attacks and murder, including the Brussels Airport bombing of March 2016. Facebook has repeatedly refused to take the posts down, saying they do not violate the company’s rules, Modamani’s lawyer said. “Whenever something happens in the news related to refugees, his picture reappears,” Modamani’s lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Facebook could not be reached immediately for comment by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  A Facebook spokesperson told Britain’s Guardian newspaper they had received a takedown request from Jun “alleging that a specific item of content on our platform violates Mr Modamani’s right of personality”.  “Access to that reported content was quickly disabled, so we do not believe there is any basis for him to seek an injunction,” the spokesperson said. One post falsely linked Modamani to an incident in Berlin last month, when a group set fire to a sleeping homeless man on a train station platform, Jun said. The post was shared 500 times and was likely to have been seen by at least 25,000 people, he said. Jun filed a preliminary injunction against Facebook Europe in December, and a court hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6 in Wurzburg, southern Germany, he said. The case comes as Germany’s justice ministry considers new policies to crack down on fake news by making Facebook and other social media companies criminally liable for failing to remove hate speech.  Facebook should be treated as a media company rather than a technology company, the justice minister said in November. Modamani now works in a fast-food restaurant in Berlin, his lawyer said. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced a series of measures in November to stem a flood of “fake news” articles in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. He said Facebook would make it easier for users to report fake news, and more difficult for fake news providers to make money through its advertising system. "
2016-10-28,-11,"Anthony Elonis wrote Facebook posts in 2010 that discussed killing a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and killing his estranged wife, but claimed the posts were song lyrics and not threats. He was convicted of sending threatening communications and served 44 months in prison. The Supreme Court in June 2015 threw out the conviction, arguing that the jury in his trial had not been properly instructed. (reut.rs/2ejBlCB) But the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in its ruling on Friday that the error was harmless because the jury would have come to the same conclusion if properly instructed. Elonis’ attorney Abraham Rein said he and his client were reviewing their options. “Naturally we are disappointed with the ruling,” Rein said. ‘A THOUSAND WAYS TO KILL YOU’ The ruling comes amid renewed controversy over what content is acceptable to post on social media.  In July 2016, a Kentucky man was arrested after he wrote a Facebook post in which he said “I will stand up and put a bullet in a cops head if others will join me,” local media reported. Prosecutors said Elonis’ posts were not mere entertainment, as he had claimed, but rather showed intent to threaten others. “There’s one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you,” Elonis wrote in one October 2010 post. “I’m not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts.” In another, Elonis described committing a school shooting. “Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined,” he wrote in a November 2010 post. “And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class.” "

Jordan Hill, 18, Tesfaye Cooper, 18 and sisters Brittany Covington, 19, and Tanishia Covington, 24, have remained in jail since they were arrested for the Jan. 3 incident. The victim’s family told authorities that they had received  overwhelming support on social media. The incident also drew the attention of then-U.S. President Barack Obama, who called it “terrible” in an interview with Chicago’s ABC affiliate.     Police said the victim knew at least one of his accused tormentors, meeting Hill at a McDonald’s restaurant in a Chicago suburb during the last week of December. Hill picked up the victim in a stolen van, police said. While the victim’s parents reported him missing, their son and Hill spent the next two days together, visiting friends and sleeping in the van. On Jan. 3, a “play fight” between the two in the Covington sisters’ apartment escalated, police said.  In the video, the attackers could be heard making comments about “white people” as the victim cowered in a corner, his mouth taped shut. At least one of the attackers could also be heard saying obscenities about Donald Trump, who was then president-elect. Police said they did not know whether the victim was a Trump supporter. Alerted to the incident by neighbors who complained of noise coming from the apartment, police found the victim outside in freezing weather wearing only a tank top, shorts and sandals.  He was taken to a hospital and later released. Members of the public alerted investigators to the Facebook Live video. "

2016-09-27,-3,"“After the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook two years ago, both parties have publicly assured that data will not be shared between them,” commissioner Johannes Caspar said in a statement.  Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock in an effort to reach a younger audience.  “The fact that this is now happening is not only a misleading of their users and the public, but also constitutes an infringement of national data protection law,” Caspar added.  Facebook has its German headquarters in Hamburg and therefore falls under Caspar’s jurisdiction. “We will appeal this order and we will work with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns,” it said.   The data watchdog said Facebook and WhatsApp were independent companies that should process their users’ data based on their own terms and conditions and data privacy policies. EU and U.S. regulators have said they would scrutinize changes to privacy settings that WhatsApp made in August.  Italy’s data privacy watchdog said on Tuesday it had also opened a probe and had asked WhatsApp to explain what information it planned to share with Facebook and what was being done to explain to users how their data might be used.

2017-03-16,-7,"Last month, the communist country began putting pressure on advertisers to try to get YouTube owner Google and other companies to remove content from foreign-based dissidents. But Information and Communication Minister Truong Minh Tuan  said the response had not yet been good enough. Although there were 8,000 anti-government videos on YouTube, Google  had only blocked 42 and hadn’t removed them completely, the ministry said. “Today we call on all Vietnamese firms that are advertising not to abet them to take advertising money from firms to use against the Vietnamese government,” Tuan told companies at a meeting in Hanoi. “We also call on all internet users to raise their voice to Google and Facebook to prevent toxic, fake content violating Vietnamese law in the online environment.” YouTube reiterated its global policy of thoroughly reviewing government requests to block content they believe is illegal and restricting it where appropriate. Facebook gave no immediate response. The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association which includes both companies, said Vietnam and its businesses benefited greatly from the internet. “It is critical for the Vietnamese government to protect the open nature of the internet, and put in place the right conditions that incentivize investment and nurture innovation,” said Jeff Paine, the group’s managing director. For governments to complain to Google and Facebook about content published online is not new, but industry officials said there was less precedent for a state to try to put pressure on them through their advertisers. Vietnam’s state-owned Vinamilk, and flag carrier Vietnam Airlines suspended YouTube ads last month after the government told them their ads had appeared alongside inappropriate content. Because of the computer-directed processes that pair adverts with their targeted audiences on social media, companies are not always aware of or have direct control over which specific videos an advert has been placed alongside. Vietnam has come under fire from Western countries and human rights groups for its Decree 72 on social media - which bans information that it deems anti-government, damaging to national security or destroying national unity. Despite the restrictions, content that ostensibly breaches the code’s standards is still prolific. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to Nguyen Khoa Hong Thanh, Operations Director at digital marketing agency Isobar Vietnam.

Local media quoted his assistant telling the court that the lawmaker was not aware of the legislation in question. The Finns party said it would next month discuss possible political sanctions for him. The party, previously known as True Finns, is known for its eurosceptic and nationalist views, but it has toned down its demands after joining Finland’s three-party government in 2015. Finland has tightened its immigration policies, along with other Nordic countries, after about 32,000 migrants and refugees arrived in the country in 2015.

The two companies have also come under scrutiny from the European Union’s 28 data protection authorities, who last month requested that WhatsApp pause sharing users’ data with its parent company until the appropriate legal protections could be assured. “We’re pleased that they’ve agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes,” the head of the ICO, Elizabeth Denham, said in a statement. “If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, they may face enforcement action from my office.” The regulator said it had also asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to better explaining to customers how their data would be used and to give them ongoing control over that data. So far, the companies have not agreed. “We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook hasn’t agreed,” Denham said.

2016-11-02,-3,"Insurers say examining social media could improve the pricing of policies, but critics say this could erode customers’ privacy. Admiral’s firstcarquote app was designed to allow new drivers to share social media data in order to get a discounted quote.  “Following discussions with Facebook, the product is launching with reduced functionality, allowing first time drivers to log-in using Facebook and share some information to secure a faster, simpler and discounted quote,” the spokeswoman said by email. “Admiral does not have access to customers’ Facebook data and does not hold social media data to set prices for its customers.” Facebook bans the use of its data on apps to make decisions about “eligibility”, such as how much interest to charge on a loan. “Protecting the privacy of the people on Facebook is of utmost importance to us,” a Facebook spokesman said by email.  “We have made sure anyone using this app is protected by our guidelines and that no Facebook user data is used to assess their eligibility. Facebook accounts will only be used for log-in and verification purposes.” Steep insurance premiums for young drivers in the UK have encouraged the use of technology to cut prices, such as telematics - black boxes installed in cars to monitor safe driving. Some UK insurers also monitor public social media data to help them identify fraudulent claims, industry sources say.   "
2016-10-09,-4,"Facebook UK Ltd is funded by affiliates such as the main Irish unit. It received over 210 million pounds ($261.14 million) in 2015 from these affiliates. But that wasn’t enough to cover its costs and the UK subsidiary reported a loss of 52 million pounds.  A spokeswoman said Facebook paid all the taxes it was required to under UK law. “We are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high skilled jobs,” she added. UK politicians, spurred by public anger about corporate tax avoidance, have criticized the tax arrangements of Facebook and other U.S. tech giants in recent years. The companies exploit loopholes in U.S. and international tax rules to pay almost no tax on non-U.S. profits. Last year, the UK government introduced a new tax to target structures like Facebook’s. In March, Facebook said it would begin to report some UK revenues in Britain from 2016, although it’s unclear what impact, if any, this change will have on its tax bill. Facebook’s UK loss was swelled by charges for share incentive schemes, which have not yet vested. Facebook won’t get the benefit of the tax deduction until this happens, which means the company may still have to pay tax for 2015. Excluding the deduction for share schemes, Facebook would have a tax bill of 4 million pounds for last year. However, the spokeswoman declined to say if Facebook had paid any tax in respect of 2015. Facebook reported worldwide net income of $3.7 billion last year, on turnover of $17.9 billion, according to its annual report. European revenue jumped 34 percent last year to $1.4 billion.

Facebook has more than 1,000 businesses signed up, the company said, with India as its biggest market. "
2016-10-09,-4,"Facebook UK Ltd is funded by affiliates such as the main Irish unit. It received over 210 million pounds ($261.14 million) in 2015 from these affiliates. But that wasn’t enough to cover its costs and the UK subsidiary reported a loss of 52 million pounds.  A spokeswoman said Facebook paid all the taxes it was required to under UK law. “We are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high skilled jobs,” she added. UK politicians, spurred by public anger about corporate tax avoidance, have criticized the tax arrangements of Facebook and other U.S. tech giants in recent years. The companies exploit loopholes in U.S. and international tax rules to pay almost no tax on non-U.S. profits. Last year, the UK government introduced a new tax to target structures like Facebook’s. In March, Facebook said it would begin to report some UK revenues in Britain from 2016, although it’s unclear what impact, if any, this change will have on its tax bill. Facebook’s UK loss was swelled by charges for share incentive schemes, which have not yet vested. Facebook won’t get the benefit of the tax deduction until this happens, which means the company may still have to pay tax for 2015. Excluding the deduction for share schemes, Facebook would have a tax bill of 4 million pounds for last year. However, the spokeswoman declined to say if Facebook had paid any tax in respect of 2015. Facebook reported worldwide net income of $3.7 billion last year, on turnover of $17.9 billion, according to its annual report. European revenue jumped 34 percent last year to $1.4 billion.

2017-01-25,-1,"“Based on feedback from the local community, we are reconsidering the quiet title process and discussing how to move forward,” Zuckerberg said in a statement on Tuesday night.  “We want to make sure we are following a process that protects the interests of property owners, respects the traditions of native Hawaiians, and preserves the environment,” he added. Hawaii state representative Kaniela Ing, who in response to the controversy introduced a bill mandating mediation in such actions involving native Hawaiians and likened Zuckerberg’s plans to those of sugar barons who took land from native Hawaiians in the 1800s, said he was heartened by the news.  “I mahalo Mr. Zuckerberg for his words of aloha and willingness to talk,” Ing said in a statement on Wednesday. He then urged the social media executive to drop the legal actions, support a local legal organization, and “join us at the table to restart a positive dialog as mutual stewards of land and culture.”  Zuckerberg’s statement comes just days after he posted on his Facebook an explanation of his Hawaii plans, as news of the actions drew headlines and anger. He said in the post the estate is made up of several properties and while he worked with majority owners of the tracts to reach a fair deal, he had filed the actions to identify all the partial owners. He said the tracts could be split between hundreds of descendants. “For most of these folks, they will now receive money for something they never even knew they had. No one will be forced off the land,” he wrote. Forbes reported that Zuckerberg paid close to $100 million for the 700 acres (283 hectares) on the secluded north shores of Kauai in 2014. "

2016-10-31,-8,"Only a month ago, the company and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg came into conflict after Facebook deleted the photo of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack, called “The Terror of War”. Solberg posted the photograph on her Facebook page after the company had deleted it from the sites of a Norwegian author and the newspaper Aftenposten, which mounted a front-page campaign urging Facebook to permit publication. “We have made a number of policy changes after The Terror of War photo. We have improved our escalation process to ensure that controversial stories and images get surfaced more quickly,” said Patrick Walker, Facebook’s director of media partnership for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “(And) in the weeks ahead, we are going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if they might otherwise violate our standards,” Walker told a meeting of the Association of Norwegian Editors in Oslo, to which he was invited following the row. “Our intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them,” they wrote. On Monday, Walker told Reuters Facebook was at the beginning of the process of changing its guidelines and could not give further details.  To the audience of journalists, the Facebook executive said the company had to have global standards of content as it was mindful that content, such as nudity, that was acceptable in one country may not be acceptable in another. Many were left unconvinced after the debate. “Facebook is trying to isolate this as a question of rules about nudity, about being careful. But this is not the question I am raising,” Espen Egil Hansen, the editor-in-chief of Aftenposten, told Reuters.  “The question is whether they now have such a dominant role in distributing information and news that they are becoming a threat against important democratic processes.” "

2017-01-20,-1,"By Paola Totaro LONDON, Jan 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has launched a raft of lawsuits that could see the U.S. billionaire secure full ownership of his island hideaway from local Hawaiian families who retain rights over the land dating back generations. Documents filed on Dec. 30 in the Hawaii State circuit court - and reported in the Honolulu Star Advertiser newspaper - show that three Zuckerberg companies filed the lawsuits under what is known as ‘quiet title and partition’. This is the legislative process used to establish ownership of land where inheritance has occurred over generations and there is no formal documentation or title deeds. Court papers seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation reveal that more than 300 people are named in one action alone. All appear to have been identified as land owners who may have inherited or retain a partial interest in the tracts bought by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2014. Forbes reported that Zuckerberg paid close to $100 million for 700 acres of prime seafront land on the secluded north shores of the island of Kauai in 2014. Around 400 acres are described as ‘white sand beachfront’ while another 350 acres contain a former sugar cane plantation, a working organic farm and another ‘2,500 feet of oceanfront’. In a Facebook post on Dec. 28, two days before the law suits were filed, Zuckerberg posted pictures and comments on a family visit to Kauai with his wife and daughter, Max. “A few years ago, Priscilla and I visited Kauai and fell in love with the community and the cloudy green mountains. We kept coming back with family and friends, and eventually decided to plant roots and join the community ourselves,” he wrote. “We bought land and we’re dedicated to preserving its natural beauty. It’s filled with wildlife like pigs, turtles, rare birds and seals, and local farmers use it to grow fruits and spices. I love taking Max to explore and see all the animals,” he wrote. “QUIET TITLE” SYSTEM Private ownership of land was virtually an unknown concept in Hawaii until the ‘Great Mahele’, a programme of land redistribution enacted in 1848. In 1850 the Kuleana Act was approved and people were given the right for the first time to petition for title of land on which they had lived or worked. This also allowed descendants to inherit land automatically in the absence of a will or deed. Today, small fractions of larger tracts of land can be owned by many descendants who have no paper proof or documentation but can prove a long-term familial - and therefore legal - interest. The ‘quiet title’ system can be used to establish ownership and to force a sale. Ultimately, the issue is decided by a judge who can put the land to auction to the highest bidder. According to the Honolulu Star Advertiser, local lawyers say that while quiet title actions do occur in Hawaii, they can be difficult for locals to defend because they require extensive research and funds. Zuckerberg’s lawyer in the matter, Keoni Shultz, did not respond to a Thomson Reuters request for comment by the time of publication. However Shultz told the Honolulu Star Advertiser that it is common for large tracts of land in Hawaii to contain smaller parcels that do not come with clear ownership titles. “Quiet title actions are the standard and prescribed process to identify all potential co-owners, determine ownership, and ensure that, if there are other co-owners, each receives appropriate value for their ownership share,” Schultz said.

The company also faces claims by victims of such attacks who are seeking to hold Facebook accountable under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act for providing support to militant groups. At a hearing last week, Garaufis criticized Facebook’s lawyers decision to send only a first-year associate to appear before him as “outrageous and irresponsible and insulting” given the issues at stake. He questioned whether Facebook had a “moral obligation” to help prevent communications by people who express interest in carrying out violent attacks, and asked whether it should be “working this out as opposed to litigating it.” At Tuesday’s hearing, Primis assured the judge that Facebook took a “zero tolerance” approach to such communications. He said Facebook will be seeking the dismissal of both lawsuits on grounds including that as a communications platform, it had immunity from being sued under federal law.

2016-09-27,-2,"The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information said Facebook was infringing data protection law and had not obtained effective approval from WhatsApp’s 35 million users in Germany. “After the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook two years ago, both parties have publicly assured that data will not be shared between them,” commissioner Johannes Caspar said in a statement. Facebook, the world’s biggest social network, bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock in an effort to reach a younger audience. “The fact that this is now happening is not only a misleading of their users and the public, but also constitutes an infringement of national data protection law,” Caspar added. Facebook, which has its German headquarters in Hamburg and therefore falls under Caspar’s jurisdiction, said in a statement that it complied with EU data protection law. “We are open to working with the Hamburg DPA in an effort to address their questions and resolve any concerns,” it said. The data watchdog said Facebook and WhatsApp were independent companies that should process their users’ data based on their own terms and conditions and data privacy policies. The Hamburg commissioner’s move comes after EU and U.S. regulators said they would scrutinise changes to privacy settings that WhatsApp made in August.

2015-12-02,-5,"Previously non-users could view public Facebook pages from sports teams, celebrities, tourist attractions and businesses without needing to log into Facebook. As a result of the changes registered Facebook users in Belgium who attempt to log in from an unrecognized web browser will be forced to comply with some added security steps, the company said. At issue is Facebook’s use of a so-called ‘datr’ cookie, which it places on users’ browsers when they visit a Facebook.com site or click a Facebook ‘Like’ button on other sites, allowing it to track the activities of that browser. Facebook says the tiny bit of software code only identifies browsers, not individuals, and helps Facebook to distinguish legitimate visits from those by attackers.  “(Removing the cookie) will cause a marginal privacy hit. That will decrease the privacy of Belgian users,” Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos told reporters last month.     Belgium’s data protection regulator took the U.S. company to court in June, accusing it of trampling on EU privacy law by tracking people without a Facebook account without their consent.     Facebook plans to appeal against the court ruling but, in complying with the order, expects it will no longer face a 250,000 euro ($265,000) daily fine leveled against it. The company has argued that Belgium has no authority on this issue, since it has its European headquarters in Ireland and as such should be policed solely by regulators there.     Belgium’s privacy regulator said the fact that the Brussels court had ruled meant it had jurisdiction over the company. The changes will be implemented as soon as the regulator serves Facebook with the order, expected sometime this week. ($1 = 0.9446 euros) "

For example, email services such as Gmail and Hotmail will not be able to scan customers’ emails to serve them with targeted advertisements without getting their explicit agreement. Most free online services rely on advertising to fund themselves. Spending on online advertising in 2015 was 36.4 billion euros, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as “Over-The-Top” (OTT) services, and seeks to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly U.S. Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. It would allow telecoms companies to use customer metadata, such as the duration and location of calls, as well as content to provide additional services and so make more money, although the telecoms lobby group ETNO said they remain more constrained than their tech competitors. The proposal will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers to deliver personalized advertisements. A previous version of the proposal would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies which are the small files placed on people’s computers when they visit a website containing information about their browsing activity. “It’s up to our people to say yes or no,” said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market. Online advertisers say such rules would undermine many websites’ ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. “It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with,” said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the IAB.

The incident, part of which was streamed on the service Facebook Live on Tuesday, drew the attention of U.S. President Barack Obama, who called it “terrible” in an interview with Chicago’s ABC-TV affiliate. ”Part of what technology allows us to see now is the terrible toll that racism and discrimination and hate takes on families and communities,” Obama said Thursday.

The introduction of Timeline for businesses comes ahead of a big event Facebook is holding in New York City on Wednesday to introduce various new services for marketers. The world’s No. 1 social network is ramping up efforts to attract the attention and budgets of large companies and advertisers ahead of its initial public offering. Earlier this month, Facebook announced plans to raise $5 billion in an IPO expected to value the company at between $75 billion and $100 billion. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, with 85 percent of it from advertising. Businesses can set up pages on Facebook for free, but the idea is that companies whose pages experience a lot of customer interest might be interested in advertising on the service as well. Macy’s Inc, Coca-Cola and Walmart Stores Inc  were among the first businesses to roll out new versions of their Facebook pages, which gives companies more control to design splashy, media-rich pages.

2016-09-13,-5,"Facebook backed down, ruling that the historical importance of the photo outweighed the company’s nudity rules. And Solberg said she hoped for cooperation between the social media giant and her elected government. “We have been working with Facebook and other social media on education, especially in conflict areas,” she told Reuters. “So there will be reasons for us to have contact with them on several issues.” “That’s my main reason for trying try to be in contact with them ... if you are really going to get education into conflict areas, social media is probably one of those platforms they can use,” she said. Solberg, of Norway’s Conservative Party, welcomed a personal letter from chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg thanking Solberg for her role and saying the company would learn from the dispute. “It was a humble letter,” Solberg said. She and Sandberg met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year.  At the time, Norway’s NTB news agency said Solberg asked Facebook’s help with ways to help train teachers and to ensure schooling in war zones or other areas in crisis. Still, Solberg also said Facebook should admit more clearly that it acts as an editor of the Internet. “They are editing and then they have to be honest on the editing,” she said. “They have to make sure that they are not editing ... history or political activism through the way they are editing,” she said.

2012-11-29,4,"Zynga stock fell 12 percent to $2.30 in after-hours trading. Facebook shares were off 5 cents at $27.27. “Zynga’s favored nation’s status is gone but it seems like it’s been slipping away for a while now,” said PJ McNealy, CEO of Digital World Research. The new agreement gives Zynga a freer hand to operate a standalone gaming website, but eliminates the San Francisco game publisher’s ability to promote its site on Facebook and to draw users from Facebook’s thriving social network of roughly 1 billion users. Visitors to Zynga’s gaming website will no longer be able to tap into their network of Facebook friends or post messages about their gaming progress to Facebook. Zynga games, like “FarmVille” and “Mafia Wars,” will still be available on Facebook’s social network, but those games will no longer feature cross-promotions directing users to Zynga’s standalone website. The move underscores the widening gap between the two social networking pioneers, which went public within seven months of each other and have been intimately tied. In recent quarters, fees from Zynga contributed 15 percent of Facebook’s total revenues, while Zynga relies on Facebook for roughly 80 percent of its revenue. The 2010 agreement provided a variety of ways for Zynga to meet its monthly user growth targets, including guaranteed promotions of certain Zynga games on Facebook. “Effective on March 31, 2013, certain provisions related to Web and mobile growth targets and schedules will no longer be applicable,” said a regulatory filing submitted by Zynga on Thursday. The changes could benefit Zynga’s rivals who have long groused about Zynga receiving preferential treatment. “There was plenty of speculation Zynga was getting referrals within the Facebook community that other gaming companies weren’t getting which helped drive web traffic to Zynga games,” said Digital World Research’s McNealy. But he noted that recent changes to Facebook’s algorithm appeared to be helping drive more traffic to Zynga competitors such as Electronic Arts and KixEye. In July, Zynga executives told analysts that the company’s revenue had plummeted in the second quarter as Facebook tweaked its algorithms, sending fewer gamers to Zynga titles. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus, at the time, assured Wall Street that Zynga was “working closely with Facebook to optimize the game ecosystem.” Both Internet companies have been trying to reduce their inter-dependence, with Zynga starting up its own Zynga.com platform, and Facebook wooing other games developers. “We have streamlined our terms with Zynga so that Zynga.com’s use of Facebook Platform is governed by the same policies as the rest of the ecosystem,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “We will continue to work with Zynga, just as we do with developers of all sizes.” Among the myriad terms of their new agreement, Zynga could elect not to collect revenue for games on its own website by solely using Facebook payment system, in which Facebook takes a 30 percent cut. The game developer could also choose not to display Facebook’s ads on its own site, Zynga.com. “Wall Street thinks Facebook is booting them off or something bad, but there’s no way this is bad,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “This is at worst neutral and at best good.” The revised agreement also allows Facebook to develop its own games, according to the filing. A person close to Facebook said the company “was not in the business of building games and we have not plans to do so.” "

2015-06-03,-15,"So-called Facebook intrusion is similar to an addiction, but the emphasis is on the way a person’s relationships with others are affected. Being young, male and spending a lot of time online also predicted a greater likelihood of unhealthy dependence on Facebook. “We know a little bit already about Facebook usage and personality,” said Dr. Robert Cloninger, a psychiatrist with the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the study. Cloninger told Reuters Health that he is concerned the study didn’t properly take personality traits into consideration.  “If you are introverted and socially shy, then your social skills may not be very good,” he said. “So using your intelligence to navigate the Internet allows you to create an image that may not be very accurate, but that gets you social contacts - it’s like you can kind of live a lie or a fantasy on the Internet.” For the study published in European Psychiatry, Agata Blachnio, a researcher at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin and her colleagues recruited Polish Facebook users to answer questionnaires, including mental health tests. The main goal, Blachnio’s team writes, was to examine “potential associations” between Internet use in general, Facebook in particular and depression. “A large body of research . . .  shows that Internet addiction often co-occurs with other disorders, such as depression, loneliness, sexual dysfunction, or other addictions,” the study team writes.  “The main aim of our study was to answer the question of whether depression and daily Internet use time was related to Facebook intrusion.”  They define Facebook intrusion as “excessive involvement in Facebook, disrupting day-today activities and interpersonal relationships.” Blachnio and her colleagues enrolled 672 native Polish-speaking participants between the ages of 15 and 75. The average age of the participants was about 28, and almost two thirds were women.  Each participant answered two questionnaires. One was designed to measure levels of Facebook intrusion, and the other to detect depression. The study team found that the amount of time spent on the Internet daily was positively associated with levels of Facebook intrusion, and that Facebook intrusion was linked with higher depression scores. But time spent on the Internet every day was not linked to depression.  Cloninger said that people likely to become addicted to Facebook are those who are low in self directedness and high at novelty seeking.   These people use social media sites like Facebook as a substitute for meeting people face to face and keep other people at a distance, he added.  “That just doesn’t give you real intimacy; it doesn’t build your capacity for trust and confidential relationships that are really deep and honest,” he said. Cloninger thinks a lot of people using Facebook in this manner are also vulnerable to being shamed and rejected. “The people who try to use it are the ones who are going to be the most vulnerable to being shamed and attacked and rejected and not being able to handle crisis well,” he said. “You’ve got this paradox of the people most likely to use it are the ones who are then going to be most vulnerable to its dangers,” he said.

2012-02-02,-5,"“The size of our user base and our users’ level of engagement are critical to our success,” Facebook said in its SEC filing for an initial public offering. Quoting industry data that there were two billion Internet users globally, it said: “We aim to connect all of them.” Growth is held back in the rest of the world, either because of limited Internet penetration, or because those who want a Facebook account already have one. In markets such as the United States or Britain, where more than half of the population already have accounts, user accounts grew less than 2 percent in the past six months, data from Internet metrics service Socialbakers Ltd show. Over the same period, Facebook gained a third of its users in India. Countries like India are where Facebook is looking for growth: even though India is now home to the second-largest Facebook community in the world, less than 4 percent of Indians have an account. Social networks are not new to India: for several years Google dominated with its Orkut service, but since mid 2010 has been in retreat. Google’s own estimates show traffic to Orkut.co.in fell from 3 million unique visitors per day to less than 1 million in the past year. Facebook, meanwhile, has risen from 6 million to 13 million over the same period. Partly this was because Orkut failed to add new features to keep users engaged, said Amit Agarwal, a long-time Indian blogger and columnist. But there’s also a generational shift taking place, he said. Orkut has primarily been for teenagers and students, he said, whereas attend any social gathering in urban India today and you will hear moms and dads asking to be tagged on any Facebook photos posted. “That’s a sea change,” he said. And Indians are passionate users. Of some 3,000 students and employees in 14 countries surveyed by network equipment manufacturer Cisco late last year, more Indians check their Facebook page at least once a day -- 92 percent of those surveyed -- than any other country surveyed. Legal sources say the case has a good chance of being taken to the Supreme Court regardless of the ruling. Facebook, Google and others would be forced to monitor each post if the court order is upheld, said a source close to one of the companies fighting to have the case thrown out. “It would be impossible to do that,” he said. India’s proportionally small Facebook community -- 4 percent of the population compared to 29 percent in the Philippines or 27 percent in Thailand -- offers room for growth, assuming that Internet access also grows. Some 80 percent of the population is not yet Internet savvy, said Asheesh Raina, principal research analyst at Gartner Inc. That means the potential for Facebook has no limit, Raina says, “for the next five years.” But it’s not quite clear what happens after that. Perhaps a model for how India may fare can be found in Indonesia. Until recently it had more users than India, despite having only a quarter of its population and about a third of its Internet users. But some in Indonesia say Facebook needs to be more proactive if it wants to see growth continuing at the same clip. Social-media strategist Enda Nasution said that part of the problem is the distraction offered by rivals: Twitter, for example, has its fifth largest user base in Indonesia, social media research company Semiocast SAS said. But it’s also about more structural problems. There are more than 40 million Facebook users in Indonesia, which means that according to one calculation, there are now more Facebook users in Indonesia than Internet users. This discrepancy is in part down to how Internet users are defined, and to the growth of mobile Internet usage. But it highlights the limits to further growth in Facebook adoption. To combat this, Nasution said, Facebook needed to start thinking of itself as more of a utility, contributing to the infrastructure that would boost usage. He pointed to a recent initiative by Google to help local enterprises register and set up websites as a way to foster more Internet activity. In its SEC filing, Facebook identified other countries with potential for growth. Brazil has grown even faster than India in the past year, 268 percent against India’s 132 percent. Facebook is also looking to Russia, Japan and South Korea, where it says less than 15 percent of Internet users have Facebook accounts. Neither Asian country is a done deal. While both South Korea and Japan are big Internet users, both already have their own social networks: South Korea has Cyworld, which has about 26 million members against an estimated 12 million for Facebook. Japan has Mixi, with 23 million members against Facebook’s seven million. “We do not know if we will be able to find an approach to managing content and information that will be acceptable to us and to the Chinese government,” it said. Facebook is unlikely to give up trying. It says it has “a dedicated policy team that monitors legal and regulatory developments and works with policymakers and regulators around the world to help ensure that our perspective is heard in matters of importance to us.” To get into China will involve making some major compromises on the way, in terms of allowing China some control over what its users post and read, says David Kirkpatrick, a Fortune columnist and author of “The Facebook Effect,” a history of the website. “I think Zuckerberg knows he has to have China if he’s going to be a truly global Internet service, and as a result he will do whatever he has to do to bring Facebook in here,” Kirkpatrick said in an interview. Options might include partnering with an existing service, or copying a company like Viadeo, a more business-oriented social networking service, says Jon Russell, Asia editor of startup news site The Next Web. France-based Viadeo bought local player Tianji in 2007, giving it a foothold in China, which has now grown to be the group’s biggest market and main focus. “That’s the kind of approach that rumours suggest Facebook would adopt,” says Bangkok-based Russell. Indeed, the growth in services like Tianji illustrate Chinese users’ appetite. Microblog service Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo each boast more than 250 million registered users. Twitter, which is also blocked in China, gets hundreds of millions of unique visits each month from users. While none are Facebook lookalikes, Chinese users are familiar enough with social networking to present a ready market when and if Facebook is unblocked. “Chinese users who are more global and are interested in making contacts overseas, say in the U.S. or Europe, will still be keen on signing on,” says Huang Meng, a Beijing-based analyst with research company Analysys International.

2016-09-12,-2,"“These are difficult decisions and we don’t always get it right,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a letter to the prime minister, obtained by Reuters on Monday under Norway’s freedom of information rules. “Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging,” Sandberg wrote. “Nonetheless, we intend to do better. We are committed to listening to our community and evolving. Thank you for helping us get this right,” she wrote. She said the letter was a sign of “how seriously we take this matter and how we are handling it”. The 1972 photograph, by Pulitzer Prize-winner Nick Ut of the Associated Press, shows screaming children running from a napalm attack. A naked nine-year-old girl, Phan Thị Kim Phúc, is at its center. Sandberg wrote that “sometimes ... the global and historical importance of a photo like ‘Terror of War’ outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook.” Facebook bars nudity with some exemptions, such as photographs of nudes in art. It is unclear exactly how disputes over its “Community Standards” reach top management. Solberg posted the photograph on her Facebook page after the company had deleted it from the sites of Norwegian authors and the newspaper Aftenposten, which mounted a front-page campaign on Friday urging Facebook to permit publication. Solberg welcomed Facebook’s about-turn. “It shows that it helps to use your voice to say ‘we want a change’. I‘m very pleased with that,” she told NRK public broadcasting on Friday. Sandberg suggested that Solberg’s staff could meet two Facebook officials visiting Norway on Friday. “I hope to see you soon - and am always available if you have further concerns,” she wrote. Norway is a big investor in Facebook. Its $891 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, had a stake of 0.52 percent in Facebook, worth $1.54 billion at the start of 2016.

2012-05-17,0,"Charles Biderman, the chief executive officer of TrimTabs Investment Research, is scooping up shares of what others are shedding. He thinks that the sell-off will end on Friday once institutions have a chance to buy Facebook shares. “I bought gold today for the first time in quite a while,” he said, citing recent price declines. The $63.5 billion SPDR Gold Shares ETF is down 6.9 percent over the last month and 1.2 percent over the last week, according to Morningstar. Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut, said that making cash available for Facebook shares could be one catalyst for recent declines in Apple Inc, which have fallen about 6.5 percent since Friday. Other companies that investors could be selling to raise cash to buy Facebook include Pandora Media Inc, LinkedIn Corp, and Google Inc, Sheldon said. Facebook is expected to be valued at more than 99 times earnings in its IPO debut, though that valuation should jump significantly higher if the stock pops on its first day, as many analysts expect. The S&P 500, by comparison, trades at a price to earnings value of 14. Apple and Google trade at P/Es of 13 and 19, respectively, making them look like bargains compared with Facebook. Sheldon said that it is also likely that mutual funds that focus on media stocks are selling traditional media companies such as CBS Corp and Viacom Inc to make space for Facebook. That could lead to short-term bargains, he said. “To the extent that these stocks have come down because of Facebook, that could be opening up opportunities for investors,” he said. CBS, for instance, is down 8.5 percent over the past five days after jumping 17.1 percent since the start of the year. Yet it continues to be attractive because of its affluent audience demographics, noted James Goss, an analyst at Barrington Research. Goss has a target price of $41 for CBS, which fell 5.5 percent to $30.02 Thursday. CBS trades at a P/E of 14.7. He said that he preferred Japanese social networking companies DeNA Co Ltd and Gree Inc. Both companies have profit margins that are comparable to Facebook and better than social gaming company Zynga Inc but trade at single digit price-to-earnings ratios and have sold off recently because of regulatory scrutiny over the addictive nature of online gaming, Einhorn said. DeNA, for instance, had fallen 21 percent over the last month through Thursday’s close. It trades at a P/E ratio of 8.5. Gree, meanwhile, had fallen 28 percent over the last month through Thursday’s close. It also trades at a P/E ratio of 8.5. "
2012-02-03,-1,"The Pew Research Center report, based on a U.S. phone survey, logs and data from November 2010, sheds light on Facebook’s possible long-term popularity as the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg heads for a $5 billion initial public offering. Ahead of the IPO, one concern about Facebook has been that users will simply bore of it after a while, a phenomenon known as “Facebook fatigue.” The Pew research suggests those worries may be unfounded. The longer that people have used Facebook site, the more frequently they hit the “like” button, commented on friends’ content, posted status updates and tagged their friends in photos, the report showed. It also concluded that having more Facebook friends kept users more involved with the social networking site. “The more Facebook friends users have, the more they perform every activity that we explored: friending, liking, private messages, commenting, posting, photo tagging, joining groups and poking,” Pew said regarding the survey by its Internet & American Life project. Facebook users on average can reach 156,569 other network users through friends of friends. The number is skewed by Facebook users with especially large friend lists, and the median is 31,170 people reached through friends of friends. “This examination of people’s activities in a very new realm affirms one of the oldest truths about the value of friendship,” said Lee Rainie, head of Pew’s Internet project. “Those who are socially active have a better shot at getting the help and emotional help they need.” The survey was based on a phone survey of 2,255 U.S. adults that was conducted in November 2010. Respondents were asked to share logs of their Facebook activity, and about 269 respondents let Facebook release data on their use. Facebook says it has 845 million active users today. "

2012-02-03,-6,"At Granite Investment Advisors in New Hampshire, Chief Investment Officer Scott Schermerhorn has already been fielding queries from clients eager to get in on the action. “We had some clients call and once we step them through the numbers, they sober up,” he said. “The valuation is 100 times earnings in a stock market that is trading at 12.” “At the end of the day, if you have a small amount of money that you are in a position to lose a chunk of it and you want to speculate on Facebook, go ahead,” he added. “But don’t use money that you really need to save to do it. I would put it in Microsoft, which is dirt cheap right now.” To be sure, most technology analysts would argue that Facebook’s growth potential far exceeds that of Microsoft Corp, whose stock has largely traded between $20 and $30 in the past decade. It is taking its first steps toward content streaming for instance, and has yet to make a serious overseas thrust. And a $100 billion valuation for Facebook at the top end - while huge in absolute terms - is not that out of whack in Silicon Valley IPO tradition. Facebook is seeking a multiple of up to 27 times annual revenue, or up to 100 times earnings. Apple Inc - today, the world’s most valuable technology corporation - went public at a valuation of just $1.19 billion in 1980, equivalent to 25 times revenue and 102 times earnings. Google - to which Facebook is most often measured against in terms of potential - was valued at $23 billion at the time of its 2004 debut, or 218 times earnings. But the sheer size of Facebook’s valuation means that it will have to become the world’s first $700 billion company if it is to replicate the gain in Google’s stock. “At these valuations, investors really need to set aside emotion...and invest with their heads,” said Edward Reinhart, managing partner at Capital Advisors Wealth Management, who owns Facebook shares bought on private markets two years ago. Reinhart, who advises clients on retirement planning, warned that hype building up ahead of Facebook’s IPO could mean “dangerous waters for the retail investor.” The anticipation surrounding the company and its growth potential recalls the hoopla that accompanied Apple‘s, Google‘s, and Amazon.com Inc’s stock debuts. All three companies have done the near-impossible -- lived up to the hype. There are many who believe Facebook will do the same, pointing to its 843 million users and the fact that the company is much bigger and more profitable than other recent Internet debuts, such as the loss-making Pandora Media Inc or Groupon Inc. “Facebook has the most potential,” said Greenwich, Connecticut-based investment manager Jeff Matthews, speaking about its business plan rather than its stock price. “It’s the next Google.” While retail investors are still combing through the numbers and doing the math, institutional investors have quietly bought Facebook shares via private pre-IPO exchanges like SharesPost and SecondMarket. About 50 equity funds of the 3,842 tracked by Morningstar disclosed holdings of Facebook stock, led by Morgan Stanley’s institutional Opportunity H fund with 3.5 percent of its $242 million portfolio devoted to the social network. Other funds that have disclosed holdings included those managed by Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, ING, Principal and MassMutual. When the SEC released Facebook’s IPO prospectus on Wednesday evening, its website slowed to a crawl as traffic increased 100 times. Facebook also made it into betting books - Irish bookmaker Paddy Power is taking bets on what the share price will be when the social network begins trading. The odds are 7 to 2 so far that investors will be paying between $25 and $34.99 for a share, according to the bookmaker. “The challenge is trying to keep individual investor enthusiasm in some sort of line with economic reality,” said Lise Buyer, an IPO adviser who worked at Google at the time of its IPO, but hasn’t worked on the Facebook IPO. Facebook “has very strong prospects, but all companies have stock prices that at some point must correlate to fundamentals.” The social network’s 2011 revenue rose 88 percent to $3.71 billion while net profit increased 65 percent to $1 billion in last year. Those are not stellar numbers when compared with Apple’s 65 percent growth in revenue to $108.24 billion in fiscal 2011. Apple also outpaced Facebook in terms of income growth, with profit increasing 85 percent to $25.92 billion. Despite this, Apple - with nearly $100 billion in cash and securities - trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 times, far lower than the 100 times historic P/E of Facebook’s IPO, assuming the $100 billion valuation. Even Microsoft -- which saw net income grow 23 percent to $23.1 billion and revenue rise 12 percent to 69.9 billion for fiscal 2011 -- trades at 11 times future earnings. That’s why Schermerhorn, whose firm already owns Apple shares, said he preferred to invest in Microsoft over Facebook. Amazon’s shares trade at a relatively dear forward P/E of 131, while Google trades at 19.5. “I know it is dominant in its space. Granted, the space is not growing as quickly as Facebook, but I am getting a nice dividend to wait,” he said of Microsoft. “I don’t have that with Facebook.” "

2012-05-22,-1,"While Facebook did not provide any specifics in its amended S-1 filing, the four underwriters reduced their earnings and revenue estimates for both the second quarter of 2012 and the full year within the next two days, according to sources. The new estimates highlighted a continued slowdown in Facebook’s growth, with the banks forecasting 30.4 percent year-on-year 2012 revenue growth on average, instead of the 36.7 percent growth previously expected. In 2011, Facebook’s revenue grew 87.9 percent year-on-year to $3.71 billion. The new numbers were relayed to big investors through phone calls and conference calls, according to investors.

2016-04-12,-1,"Facebook launched chatbots on Tuesday with a handful of partners, including Shopify, an ecommerce site, and cable TV news network CNN. The chatbots are part of Facebook’s effort to build out its  Messenger instant messaging app as the go-to place for customers to contact businesses - a strategy that threatens traditional call centers and may cut personnel costs for some businesses. “You’ll never have to call 1-800-Flowers again,” Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco.  Though messaging platforms including Kik, Slack and Telegram already have chatbots, Facebook is seen having several distinct advantages. For one, Facebook commands a vast trove of data on the estimated 1.6 billion people who use the main service and the 900 million who use Messenger. That allows developers to create chatbots that can personalize tasks, such as making an airline booking or a restaurant reservation. “From the enterprise or developer perspective, access to those 1.6 billion people is very exciting,” said Lauren Kunze, principal at Pandorabots, which has been building and deploying chatbots for companies since 2002.  “People like a personalized experience and when the chatbot can remember personal details and follow up,” she said.  CNN’s bot, for example, can learn users’ news preferences and recommend articles and summaries accordingly. For a shopping site, users could input price ranges and other preferences before receiving suggestions from the bot.  Chatbots could eventually automate such interactions and eliminate customer service calls.  “You’re offloading the pain of navigating those phone systems,” said Chris Fohlin, director of client strategy at consulting agency Engine Digital. Last year, Facebook partnered with online shopping sites Zulily and Everlane to send customer receipts and order updates through Messenger. It now sees 1 billion messages sent between users and businesses every month, said Seth Rosenberg, Messenger’s product manager. That prompted the company to begin experimenting with chatbots.  “Our goal is to make personalization available at scale for businesses,” Seth Rosenberg, Messenger’s product manager, said in an interview. “It’s giving them ways to deeply engage with their consumers as everything becomes more competitive.” By making Messenger the go-to place for business-to-person interactions, Facebook hopes people will spend even more time using the app and increasingly rely on it for day-to-day tasks. Facebook’s chatbots could also threaten businesses’ individual apps. Although there are millions of apps, users spend nearly 90 percent of their time on five apps, according to research firm Forrester. In the United States, two of those apps are typically Facebook and Messenger. "

2012-06-05,-14,"The company, which has seen revenue growth slow in past few months, began letting marketers craft ads destined specifically for mobile versions of the No. 1 social network on Tuesday. It’s also letting advertisers direct ads into users’ news feeds. Both represent significant shifts for the company, which has until now restricted marketers’ presence on certain parts of its service. The eight-year-old company started by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm-room on May 18 became the first American company to debut at over $100 billion value; but mounting worries about its inability to fully transform a growing mobile presence into ad revenue have helped wipe $32 billion off its value. Shortly before the IPO, several analysts lowered financial targets on the company after Facebook cautioned about its revenue growth due to the rapid shift by users to mobile devices. “It is a major drawback to Facebook that they have been unable to monetize the mobile activity of its user base,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Previously, advertisers could buy a broad category of “sponsored stories”: advertisements that would run on the website. But Facebook controlled whether the ads actually appeared on mobile devices, and in users news feeds. The tweaks to its advertising system come at a time investors are questioning the long-term money-making potential of Facebook’s underlying business, and the social networks’ effectiveness as a marketing channel. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday found that four out of five Facebook users have never brought a product or service as a result of advertising or comments on the site. The shares closed Tuesday down 3.8 percent at $25.87, after setting a record low of $25.75. Facebook’s steady share-price decline has drawn criticism -- and lawsuits -- from investors accusing the stock of being overpriced at an IPO level of $38. Others demanded compensation from the Nasdaq exchange for a series of glitches that delayed the start of trade by about half an hour. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) has reached out to at least one brokerage that lost money due to the botched initial public offering, saying it will make an announcement on Wednesday, a person at the brokerage firm said. The exchange, which has battled NYSE Euronext NYX.N for the highest-profile IPOs, is expected to release details of a plan to make up some losses sustained by banks and trading firms, collectively estimated at above $100 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. Nasdaq declined to comment on Tuesday. Making the mobile version of the Facebook more accessible to ads is a “necessary step,” Pivotal Research Group’s Wieser said. But Facebook should continue to take a gradual approach to mobile ads so as not to irk users unaccustomed to commercials intruding on their small mobile screens, he added. Facebook spokeswoman Annie Ta said there would be a limit to how many ads appear in users’ mobile feeds, though she declined to say what the cap was. The latest changes are part of Facebook’s efforts to make its advertising-system easier to use, she said. “We want to make it easier for advertisers to get the distribution they want,” she said. Debra Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer, said that some companies which committed to large advertising purchases on Facebook last year are now evaluating the performance of those ads and buying new ads on an as-needed basis. “There’s been a general acknowledgement by marketers that last year they spent a lot of money acquiring ‘likes’ and now they want to know what to do with them,” said Williamson. A February study by ExactTarget, presented in a graphical chart by eMarketer, suggested Facebook fared worse than email or direct-mail marketing in terms of influencing consumers’ decisions. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, primarily from advertising. But revenue growth has slowed in recent quarters, stoking concerns about its ad business. In recent weeks, Facebook has taken steps to give advertisers more control over its “reach generator” feature, which broadens the number of people that can view a marketing message. Until now, the service, which cost large advertisers upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of several months, was “always on” — it did not allow customers to choose which posts they wanted to amplify. Smaller businesses grumbled that the feature was limited to major ad buyers, served by Facebook representatives. Facebook is now making the service available on a self-serve basis, rather than requiring advertisers to deal with its sales representatives. ”This is really helpful because it’s so a la carte,“ said Jim Tobin, the President of Ignite Social Media, a social media marketing agency that counts Chrysler and Samsung among its clients. ”Even for big advertisers who may be spending a few hundred thousand dollars on social, you have the flexibility to take a single post and amplify it. “That’s good for Facebook, because a lot of $5 and $10 promotions from tens and thousands of advertisers adds up to real income.” "

And Solberg said she hoped for cooperation between the social media giant and her elected government. “We have been working with Facebook and other social media on education, especially in conflict areas,” she told Reuters. “So there will be reasons for us to have contact with them on several issues.” “That’s my main reason for trying try to be in contact with them ... if you are really going to get education into conflict areas, social media is probably one of those platforms they can use,” she said. Solberg, of Norway’s Conservative Party, welcomed a personal letter from chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg thanking Solberg for her role and saying the company would learn from the dispute. “It was a humble letter,” Solberg said. She and Sandberg met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year.  At the time, Norway’s NTB news agency said Solberg asked Facebook’s help with ways to help train teachers and to ensure schooling in war zones or other areas in crisis. Still, Solberg also said Facebook should admit more clearly that it acts as an editor of the Internet. “They are editing and then they have to be honest on the editing,” she said. “They have to make sure that they are not editing ... history or political activism through the way they are editing,” she said.

2016-06-29,-4,"During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their state’s voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government.  “Generally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election,” said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study. Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its “Trending Topics” module. At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a “new town hall” for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global politics and government outreach director Her team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.   Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a “remain” vote in Britain’s referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.    A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.   A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views.  Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britain’s vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any.  Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media.  “To not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies,” Steinberg wrote. “We’re getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other.”  Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

2012-06-05,-14,"The company, which has seen revenue growth slow in past few months, began letting marketers craft ads destined specifically for mobile versions of the No. 1 social network on Tuesday. It’s also letting advertisers direct ads into users’ news feeds. Both represent significant shifts for the company, which has until now restricted marketers’ presence on certain parts of its service. The eight-year-old company started by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm-room on May 18 became the first American company to debut at over $100 billion value; but mounting worries about its inability to fully transform a growing mobile presence into ad revenue have helped wipe $32 billion off its value. Shortly before the IPO, several analysts lowered financial targets on the company after Facebook cautioned about its revenue growth due to the rapid shift by users to mobile devices. “It is a major drawback to Facebook that they have been unable to monetize the mobile activity of its user base,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Previously, advertisers could buy a broad category of “sponsored stories”: advertisements that would run on the website. But Facebook controlled whether the ads actually appeared on mobile devices, and in users news feeds. The tweaks to its advertising system come at a time investors are questioning the long-term money-making potential of Facebook’s underlying business, and the social networks’ effectiveness as a marketing channel. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday found that four out of five Facebook users have never brought a product or service as a result of advertising or comments on the site. The shares closed Tuesday down 3.8 percent at $25.87, after setting a record low of $25.75. Facebook’s steady share-price decline has drawn criticism -- and lawsuits -- from investors accusing the stock of being overpriced at an IPO level of $38. Others demanded compensation from the Nasdaq exchange for a series of glitches that delayed the start of trade by about half an hour. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) has reached out to at least one brokerage that lost money due to the botched initial public offering, saying it will make an announcement on Wednesday, a person at the brokerage firm said. The exchange, which has battled NYSE Euronext NYX.N for the highest-profile IPOs, is expected to release details of a plan to make up some losses sustained by banks and trading firms, collectively estimated at above $100 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. Nasdaq declined to comment on Tuesday. Making the mobile version of the Facebook more accessible to ads is a “necessary step,” Pivotal Research Group’s Wieser said. But Facebook should continue to take a gradual approach to mobile ads so as not to irk users unaccustomed to commercials intruding on their small mobile screens, he added. Facebook spokeswoman Annie Ta said there would be a limit to how many ads appear in users’ mobile feeds, though she declined to say what the cap was. The latest changes are part of Facebook’s efforts to make its advertising-system easier to use, she said. “We want to make it easier for advertisers to get the distribution they want,” she said. Debra Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer, said that some companies which committed to large advertising purchases on Facebook last year are now evaluating the performance of those ads and buying new ads on an as-needed basis. “There’s been a general acknowledgement by marketers that last year they spent a lot of money acquiring ‘likes’ and now they want to know what to do with them,” said Williamson. A February study by ExactTarget, presented in a graphical chart by eMarketer, suggested Facebook fared worse than email or direct-mail marketing in terms of influencing consumers’ decisions. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, primarily from advertising. But revenue growth has slowed in recent quarters, stoking concerns about its ad business. In recent weeks, Facebook has taken steps to give advertisers more control over its “reach generator” feature, which broadens the number of people that can view a marketing message. Until now, the service, which cost large advertisers upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of several months, was “always on” — it did not allow customers to choose which posts they wanted to amplify. Smaller businesses grumbled that the feature was limited to major ad buyers, served by Facebook representatives. Facebook is now making the service available on a self-serve basis, rather than requiring advertisers to deal with its sales representatives. ”This is really helpful because it’s so a la carte,“ said Jim Tobin, the President of Ignite Social Media, a social media marketing agency that counts Chrysler and Samsung among its clients. ”Even for big advertisers who may be spending a few hundred thousand dollars on social, you have the flexibility to take a single post and amplify it. “That’s good for Facebook, because a lot of $5 and $10 promotions from tens and thousands of advertisers adds up to real income.” "
2013-12-03,1,"“This means you are still friends, but updates from that person won’t appear in your News Feed. The goal of this change is to help people curate their newsfeed and see more of the content that they care about,” Facebook said in an email. The world’s largest social network is constantly tweaking its newsfeed - the main page users look at on the network - often by reducing clutter, especially from advertising, and bringing to the surface or revealing the posts deemed most relevant to any particular user. Facebook began rolling out the “Unfollow” button and a related change to its users on Monday. It added a “Following” button next to the usual “Like” button on a page or next to the “Friends” button on a personal timeline, which will also enable users to block posts."

2016-09-09,-2,"By Terje Solsvik OSLO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Norway’s prime minister joined a campaign by a Norwegian newspaper on Friday accusing Facebook Inc of undue censorship by barring a Vietnam War era news photograph showing a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack. The social media giant erased the iconic photograph, showing children running from a bombed village, from the Facebook pages of several Norwegian authors and media outlets, including top-selling newspaper Aftenposten. Captured in 1972 by Pulitzer Prize-winner Nick Ut of the Associated Press, the image of screaming children running from a napalm attack shows a naked nine-year-old girl at its centre. Aftenposten splashed the photograph across the front page of its newspaper on Friday, next to a large Facebook logo, and wrote a front-page editorial headlined “Dear Mark Zuckerberg”, arguing that the network was undermining democracy. Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg then posted the photograph on her own Facebook profile, writing that it had contributed to change the course of world history. The image later disappeared from the page. “Facebook gets it wrong when they censor such pictures. It limits the freedom of speech,” Solberg wrote. “I say yes to healthy, open and free debate - online and wherever else we go. But I say no to this form of censorship.” Solberg in her posting also praised Facebook for combating pictures of child abuse. Aftenposten, in its editorial, said Facebook should be able to tell the difference between child pornography and famous war photography. Facebook said in a statement its rules were more blunt than the company itself would prefer, adding that restrictions on nudity were necessary on a global platform. “While we recognize that this photo is iconic, it’s difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others,” a company spokesperson wrote. “We try to find the right balance between enabling people to express themselves while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community. Our solutions won’t always be perfect, but we will continue to try to improve our policies and the ways in which we apply them.” In May, Solberg was present when Facebook opened its first Norwegian office.

2016-08-08,-4,"But Facebook said it had provided “round the clock assistance” to the authorities in Bavaria following a spate of violent attacks in Munich, Wuerzburg and Ansbach last month. A spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry said it was examining whether there was a need to change the law or whether there was a problem with its implementation. A recent spate of attacks in Germany has highlighted the importance security agencies give to working with social networks to uncover possible links to militant groups. Police said the Ansbach bomber had six Facebook accounts including one held under a false identity. Traces of an online messaging conversation found on his phone also suggest he was influenced by an unknown person up until the time of the attack, Bavaria’s interior minister said. Germany’s spy chief called on Monday for a more intensive exchange of information between social networks and security agencies in the fight against terrorism. “Social networks are an important communication method for jihadists. Therefore closer co-operation between the security agencies and the operators of social networks is necessary,” Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.    Facebook produced data for 42 percent of requests in Germany relating to criminal cases in the second half of 2015, compared with 54 percent in France and 82 percent in Britain. It said it rejected requests that were overly broad or vague. The company said it worked with law enforcement officials to help them use their systems, but said there were still a large number of officers that didn’t know how to make a successful request. “Along with our points of contact in Law Enforcement we work tirelessly to raise awareness of the correct procedures,” a Facebook spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said co-operation between Facebook and the BKA federal police agency and the BfV was good. “Conversations are constructive and co-operation is also fruitful as far as we can see,” he said, adding they were not in a position to judge how well Facebook worked with the state authorities. "
2012-05-16,-4,"While Facebook is a unique company with 900 million users, some recent IPOs serve as reminders that the sizzle for once hot companies can fade quickly. Of seven media or social media company IPOs in the last year, only LinkedIn is now trading above where its stock closed after its trading debut. Millennial Media, a mobile advertising company, saw its shares jump 92 percent the day its shares debuted in late March. Since then, the stock has slid nearly 46 percent to $13.40, as of Tuesday’s close. Last year, shares of Demand Media jumped 33 percent on the company’s initial day of trading. Over the next six months, they fell 49 percent, and are down about 63 percent overall as of Tuesday. And investors who bought shares of Groupon after they closed 31 percent higher on the first day in November have lost 53 percent as of Tuesday’s close as the company’s shares slid to $12.17 each. Optimistic potential investors in Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, may consider the company immune to a post-IPO letdown because of its popularity. But there are ways investors can time their purchases to prevent getting caught up in the early euphoria. Facebook, which is expected to have its initial public offering on Friday, is planning to raise as much as $16 billion by selling about 421 million shares at a target price range of $34 to $38 each. While the company has set aside some shares for retail investors, brokers tend to reserve this allotment for wealthier clients. Those who don’t qualify will be stuck trying to get in on the buying frenzy of the first day, at a time when some analysts expect shares of Facebook to pop more than 30 percent to more than $50 each. Waiting a week or two from the first day of trading may prove to be more profitable than trying to get in on the first day, analysts said. “You want some of the frothiness from the excitement of the IPO to burn off,” said Jim Krapfel, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the company and values the company at $32 per share. Buying at the first day’s closing price would leave “limited upside for long-term fundamental investors,” he said in a recent report on the company. Dave Abate, a financial planner with Strategic Wealth Partners in Seven Hills, Ohio, said that he is telling clients to wait a couple of days for the stock to reach an equilibrium. Facebook is the first time his firm has developed a client strategy specifically for an IPO, he said. “Everyone and their grandma uses Facebook and wants a piece of it. They feel like they’ve missed the boat with Apple and this is their opportunity to get in on the ground floor,” he said. Zuckerberg, who turned 28 this week, is one of the world’s youngest billionaires, but despite the allure of Facebook, investing in the company comes with risks, such as the company’s reputation with being unconcerned about user’s privacy, Abate said. “I consider Zuckerberg a pretty big risk himself. He’s unpredictable and if he grows bored with the company (and leaves) I don’t know what’s left of Facebook at that point,” he said. Abate is also concerned that Zuckerberg has too much power, with more than 50 percent of voting rights, increasing the risk in investing in the company. For clients that remain interested in Facebook, Abate is counseling them that there will be several dips in the future to buy the stock without buying at an over inflated value because of “short-term flippers.” One way to avoid short-term remorse: buying shares of mutual funds that already own shares of Facebook. T. Rowe Price, for instance, purchased shares of Facebook traded on private markets and has spread them across 19 funds. Krapfel said a date potential investors should watch for is 91 days after the IPO, or August 20. That’s the day that the first so-called lock-up period for 172 million shares expires, allowing some insiders to sell their shares. The end of a lock-up period typically leads to a decline in share prices, according to a 2001 paper in the Journal of Finance by Laura Casares Field and Gordon Hanka. The pair found that a company’s average trading volume tends to increase by 40 percent and shares fall an average of 1.5 percent over three days after its lock-up ends. August will be a relatively small insider selling window. Most employees and directors, except for Zuckerberg, will have to wait to sell their insider shares after 151 days, Krapfel said. The majority of the insider shares - 1.34 billion in all, which includes Zuckerberg’s stake - can be sold 181 days after the IPO. Some analysts said that heavy selling by insiders may be a warning sign for investors. “At this stage, if anyone sold a considerable stake at the lockup stage it would be a giant yellow flag, especially given the young age of executives,” said John Kozey, an equities analyst at Reuters. The last four months of 2012 will bring two more milestones. Nasdaq OMX Group, the company behind the exchange, changed its rules in April to allow companies to be included in its Nasdaq 100, a cap-weighted index of the largest non-financial shares in the Nasdaq Composite Index, four months after they begin trading. Once that happens, analysts expect that index funds and ETFs that track like the Nasdaq 100, such as the $31.3 billion PowerShares QQQ ETF, will add shares of Facebook, potentially lifting the stock by a few percentage points. And in November, Facebook will be eligible for inclusion in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the benchmark for most mutual funds. S&P typically requires IPOs to trade for six to 12 months before considering the companies for its indices. The announcement of a new company to the S&P 500 index typically results in a 5.7 percent one-day pop in the company’s shares, according to a paper in Financial Management in 2006. "

2016-12-27,-12,"Hun Sen has been Cambodia’s leader for three decades but his grip on power was shaken in a 2013 general election when the CNRP won 55 seats in the National Assembly, leaving the Cambodian People’s Party with 68 seats in the 123-seat assembly. Members of the opposition have complained of a crackdown by the government and its allies in a bid to intimidate critics before a general election in 2018. The Phnom Penh Municipal Court found Sam Rainsy and two members of his social media team, Ung Chung Leang and Sathya Sambath, guilty of citing the false 1979 border treaty.  The fake treaty, which they posted on Facebook, purported to show Vietnam and Cambodia agreeing to get rid of their mutual boundary. Presiding Judge Leang Samnath sentenced Sam Rainsy to five years in prison and Ung Chung Leang and Sathya Sambath to three years, all in absentia. “The court orders the arrests of Ung Chung Leang, Sathya Sambath and Sam Rainsy to serve these sentences,” Judge Leang Samnath told the court. Cambodia has fretted for centuries about its much bigger neighbors, Vietnam to the east and Thailand to the northwest, encroaching on its territory. The issue remains emotive and many Cambodians are suspicious of both countries. Sam Rainsy has been living in France since 2015 to avoid arrest in a separate defamation case. He did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday but said on Twitter the case against him and the two others had been “fabricated” by a “kangaroo court”.  The CNRP said it had no knowledge of the whereabouts of Ung Chung Leang and Sathya Sambath. "
2017-01-27,-5,"“Now that I understand the issues better, it’s clear we made a mistake,” the billionaire added. Zuckerberg had previously tried to secure parcels of land within the property by filing quiet title actions, a legal mechanism used to establish ownership and force a sale of land where inheritance rights stretch back generations and formal documentation is lacking. Hawaii state representative Kaniela Ing, a Democrat, in response to the controversy this week introduced a bill that would require mediation in similar disputes involving native Hawaiians. At the time, the lawmaker likened Zuckerberg’s plans to those of sugar barons who took land from native Hawaiians in the 1800s. Business Insider reported some Hawaii residents planned to protest at Zuckerberg’s property on Saturday.   The local news article at the top bore the names of Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, as co-authors but it only had Zuckerberg’s name listed at the bottom.  “The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward,” their article said.  Forbes reported Zuckerberg paid close to $100 million for the 700 acres (283 hectares) on the secluded north shores of Kauai in 2014. “I’ve got to give him (Zuckerberg) the benefit of the doubt and say it looks like he’s sincere and trying to reach out to the community,” Ing said. But the lawmaker added that he will not withdraw his bill, saying it was needed to help improve Hawaii’s outdated land laws.  A representative for Zuckerberg could not immediately be reached for further comment.  Zuckerberg in a previous statement said the estate is made up of several properties and while he worked with majority owners of the tracts to reach a fair deal, he filed the actions to identify all partial owners. “For most of these folks, they will now receive money for something they never even knew they had.

2017-01-27,-5,"“Now that I understand the issues better, it’s clear we made a mistake,” the billionaire added. Zuckerberg had previously tried to secure parcels of land within the property by filing quiet title actions, a legal mechanism used to establish ownership and force a sale of land where inheritance rights stretch back generations and formal documentation is lacking. Hawaii state representative Kaniela Ing, a Democrat, in response to the controversy this week introduced a bill that would require mediation in similar disputes involving native Hawaiians. At the time, the lawmaker likened Zuckerberg’s plans to those of sugar barons who took land from native Hawaiians in the 1800s. Business Insider reported some Hawaii residents planned to protest at Zuckerberg’s property on Saturday.   The local news article at the top bore the names of Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, as co-authors but it only had Zuckerberg’s name listed at the bottom.  “The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward,” their article said.  Forbes reported Zuckerberg paid close to $100 million for the 700 acres (283 hectares) on the secluded north shores of Kauai in 2014. “I’ve got to give him (Zuckerberg) the benefit of the doubt and say it looks like he’s sincere and trying to reach out to the community,” Ing said. But the lawmaker added that he will not withdraw his bill, saying it was needed to help improve Hawaii’s outdated land laws.  A representative for Zuckerberg could not immediately be reached for further comment.  Zuckerberg in a previous statement said the estate is made up of several properties and while he worked with majority owners of the tracts to reach a fair deal, he filed the actions to identify all partial owners. “For most of these folks, they will now receive money for something they never even knew they had. No one will be forced off the land,” Zuckerberg wrote in the previous statement. "

2012-01-10,1,"Mercedes-Benz USA is bringing Facebook to its cars, with a special version of the service that is built-in to a new in-vehicle telematics system that will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Accessing Facebook on the road is not the exactly the same as using the social network on a personal computer or a smartphone. The version of Facebook offered in Daimler AG’s Mercedes is stripped down to a limited set of features, specially designed for drivers and centered around the locations of friends and businesses. But according to Facebook Vice President of Partnerships and Platform Marketing Dan Rose, the Mercedes version of Facebook reflects the social networking service’s expansion to a growing list of settings where screens and Internet connections are available. “Now that cars have screens that are intelligent, you would expect that more and more car manufacturers will want to make those screens capable of allowing people to connect with their friends and take advantage of the social context that comes along with that,” Rose said in an interview. “One of the core things that people do on their screens in the car is GPS navigation and the ability to see which of your friends are nearby is something we think will be really interesting for people.” He noted Facebook is also increasingly being integrated into televisions, with various TV manufacturers expected to showcase built-in Facebook integration at CES. DirectTV will show off a new social TV app with Facebook capabilities at CES, allowing people to share what they are watching and to add commentary. But unlike television sets, offering Facebook in motor vehicles involves critical safety considerations, particularly at a time when lawmakers and safety advocates are increasingly focused on distracted driving. The Facebook application displays a variety of standard, pre-written postings that a driver can publish on Facebook with quick taps or turns of a knob. If a particular destination is already entered into the car’s navigation system, the driver can automatically publish a Facebook posting stating they are en route to that destination, along with an estimated time of arrival, based on the current traffic patterns. The Mercedes Facebook offering is the result of a collaboration between the two companies that started about six months ago, according to Policano. A Mercedes engineering team based in Palo Alto actually built the Facebook application, with input from Facebook on various aspects. Facebook is one of several specially designed apps, including Google Inc and Yelp, that Mercedes drivers can flip between by turning a knob. The apps are part of Mercedes new mbrace2 telematics system, which features a high-resolution color screen near the dashboard and a high-speed wireless Internet connection. The mbrace2 system will be available with the launch of the 2013 SL-Class Mercedes in the Spring. The company plans to make it a standard feature on all Mercedes 2013 models that will roll out throughout the year. One popular Facebook feature that Mercedes drivers will not get, however, is the ability to play social games such as Zynga Inc’s Farmville. Mercedes’ version of Facebook does not support third-party apps. "
2014-06-17,-2,"The new app, dubbed Slingshot, allows users to sign up for the service with their mobile phone number and connect with friends in their phone’s contact list or, if they want, by finding their Facebook friends. Photos on Slingshot disappear from users’ phones shortly after they are viewed, reflecting a growing anxiety about privacy in the age of Internet social networking. Facebook’s release of Slingshot comes as a new crop of mobile messaging services gain popularity and threaten to draw younger users away from Facebook’s 1.28 billion-user social network. To help mitigate the threat from alternative social networks, Facebook is developing a variety of standalone apps and acquiring fast-growing rivals. In 2012 it acquired photo-sharing service Instagram and in February it announced plans to acquire messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion. Snapchat, an app that lets users send messages that automatically disappear after a few seconds, turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last year, according to media reports at the time. Unlike other messaging apps, Slingshot will not allow users to view the messages they have received from their friends until they reciprocate and send back a photo or video of their own. The rule is designed to make Slingshot a service for which everyone contributes material, although it could require a learning curve that confuses or turns off some users. “When everyone participates there’s less pressure, more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences,” Facebook said in a blog post announcing the service on Tuesday. Slingshot will be available in the United States on Tuesday for Android and iOS devices.    (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Ken Wills)"

2012-12-12,-4,"New tools introduced on Wednesday will make it easier for Facebook’s members to quickly determine who can view the photos, comments and other information about them that appears on different parts of the website, and to request that any objectionable photos they’re featured in be removed. A new privacy “shortcut” in the top-right hand corner of the website provides quick access to key controls such as allowing users to manage who can contact them and to block specific people. The new controls are the latest changes to Facebook’s privacy settings, which have been criticized in the past for being too confusing. Facebook Director of Product Sam Lessin said the changes were designed to increase users’ comfort level on the social network, which has roughly one billion users. “When users don’t understand the concepts and controls and hit surprises, they don’t build the confidence they need,” said Lessin. Facebook, Google Inc and other online companies have faced increasing scrutiny and enforcement from privacy regulators as consumers entrust ever-increasing amounts of information about their personal lives to Web services. In April, Facebook settled privacy charges with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended. Under the settlement, Facebook is required to get user consent for certain changes to its privacy settings and is subject to 20 years of independent audits. Facebook’s Lessin said some users don’t understand that the information they post on their Timeline profile page is not the only personal information about them that may be viewable by others. Improvements to Facebook’s so-called Activity Log will make it easier for users to see at a glance all the information that involves them across the social network. Facebook also said it is changing the way that third-party apps, such as games and music players, get permission to access user data. An app must now provide separate requests to create a personalized service based on a user’s personal information and to post automated messages to the Facebook newsfeed on behalf of a user - previously users agreed to both conditions by approving a single request. The revamped controls follow proposed changes that Facebook has made to its privacy policy and terms of service. The changes would allow Facebook to integrate user data with that of its recently acquired photo-sharing app Instagram, and would loosen restrictions on how members of the social network can contact other members using the Facebook email system. Nearly 600,000 Facebook users voted to reject the proposed changes, but the votes fell far short of the roughly 300 million needed for the vote to be binding, under Facebook’s existing rules. The proposed changes also would eliminate any such future votes by Facebook users. "
2012-03-07,-8,"* Says problem resolved LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc, the world’s biggest social networking site, said its service was unavailable in some European countries on Wednesday morning because of technical problems. “Today we experienced technical difficulties causing the site to be unavailable for a number of users in Europe,”  Facebook said. “The issue has been resolved and everyone should now have access to Facebook. We apologise for any inconvenience.” Some users turned to rival service Twitter to vent their frustrations at the outage, which appeared to last for about two hours according to postings.

2012-08-31,-13,"* Less than 1 pct of Likes on any page likely to be removed By Alexei Oreskovic SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is weeding out fake “Likes” on its social network that are being caused by spammers, malware and black marketeers as it strives to maintain credibility as an advertising platform. Facebook said the number of Likes, or endorsements by users, on corporate pages is likely to drop by less than 1 percent, on average, after the crackdown. “Newly improved automated efforts will remove those Likes gained by malware, compromised accounts, deceived users, or purchased bulk Likes,” Facebook said in a post on its official blog on Friday. “While we have always had dedicated protections against each of these threats on Facebook, these improved systems have been specifically configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes,” the post continued. Thanks to a growing black market, companies can instantly raise their profile on Facebook by purchasing thousands of Likes at a time - a practice that is forbidden by the No. 1 social network, which has 955 million users. Many of these Likes come from bogus Facebook user accounts rather than genuine users of the social network. Meanwhile, various spam-like programs on Facebook deceive users into unwittingly liking something when they perform another action, such as clicking to watch a video. Facebook said the cleanup will benefit both users and companies that maintain pages on the network, by giving a more accurate measurement of fan count and demographics. Ensuring the integrity of Likes is serious business for Facebook, which depends on advertising revenue from large brands and other businesses. Many of the ad campaigns that companies conduct on Facebook are designed to garner Likes - a sign that their marketing message has resonated with consumers. “It’s their currency,” said Jeremiah Owyang, a partner at research firm Altimeter Group. “Facebook is playing the Federal Reserve, to take the counterfeit currency off the market to ensure that there’s quality in the marketplace.” The problem is not unique to Facebook, say analysts, who note that Twitter and Google Inc also grapple with fake accounts, spam and other techniques to game the service. But for Facebook, the pressure to show that activity on its social network is genuine has grown as concerns have mounted on Wall Street about the company’s long-term profit potential. Shares of Facebook set a new low on Friday, falling as much as 5.3 percent to $18.08, after brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. Facebook has lost more than 50 percent of its market value since its initial public offering in May. Facebook estimates that 1.5 percent of its users are “undesirable” accounts set up for purposes that violate its terms of service, according to its most recent 10-Q regulatory filing. “I think what they’re intending to do is get a handle on it before it gets really out of control,” Brian Blau, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said. “You can imagine no business wants to pay for advertising to fake accounts.” "
2012-10-05,-1,"A Facebook spokeswoman said that Lockhart is leaving because he decided he wanted to remain on the East Coast, and did not want to move to California, where Facebook is headquartered. Lockhart’s last day at Facebook has not yet been determined. The Facebook spokeswoman said the company hopes to continue to work with Lockhart as an independent consultant. Lockhart was the chief spokesman and senior adviser to President Clinton between 1998 and 2000, and co-founded the Glover Park Group communications firm in 2001. Facebook, which announced on Thursday that it had surpassed a billion monthly active users, ranks among the Web’s most popular destinations alongside websites owned by Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc. But the company has faced a rough reception on Wall Street, as concerns about its slowing revenue growth rate has cut its market valuation by more than 40 percent. Shares of Facebook were down 2.6 percent at $21.37 in midday trading on Friday. In June, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Bret Taylor announced that he would leave the company, and Facebook’s director of platform partnerships and its director of product management have also departed in recent months.

Facebook’s Managing Director Northern, Central and Eastern Europe Martin Ott, who is based in Hamburg, may be held responsible for the social platform not removing hate speech, a spokeswoman for the prosecution said last month. A Facebook spokesperson last month declined to comment on a possible investigation, adding “we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees.” Facebook has a partnership with a group called FSM, which voluntarily monitors multimedia service providers, and has said it would encourage its users to push back against racism.

Depending on how the roadshow for investors go, Facebook could begin trading on Nasdaq as soon as May 18. Demand for Facebook shares will likely outstrip supply, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note, rating the stock “outperform”. “We believe Facebook will capture an increasing percentage of spending on offline advertising, while growing its share of online advertising as well as usage continues to increase and advertisers become more comfortable with the cost effectiveness of online advertising,” Pachter said. Not everyone on Wall Street is as bullish. Steven Weinstein, an analyst with ITG Investment Research, said that Facebook’s existing lines of business do not have the horsepower to justify investing in the company at a nearly $100 billion valuation. “Just to get a reasonable return, a stock like this has to double in six-ish years,” said Weinstein. “Right now they’re not on trajectory to get there,” he said, citing the deceleration in Facebook’s advertising business and the limited contribution from its payments business. But he said Facebook has a lot of opportunities to find new sources of revenue growth, including mobile advertising and potentially creating an online advertising network. Weinstein published a report analyzing Facebook’s financials in April, though his firm does not provide a price target or rating on the stock. In a note dated April 24, Pivotal Research Group had reduced the enterprise valuation of Facebook to $75 billion from $82 billion, saying Facebook’s first-quarter results were disappointing. Wedbush is the first financial firm to weigh in with an official price target and rating on Facebook’s stock, as investors prepare for what is expected to be the largest IPO in Silicon Valley history. Facebook’s high valuation will put it on par with large-cap technology powerhouses such as Cisco Systems Inc and Amazon.com Inc, making it certain to attract coverage from dozens of Wall Street analysts. But analysts whose firms are involved in the IPO - Facebook’s prospectus lists 33 underwriters - are unlikely to initiate coverage of Facebook until several weeks after the offering because of securities regulations "
2012-10-05,-2,"Lockhart, who is the latest high-profile executive to depart Facebook following its disappointing initial public offering in May, is leaving 15 months after joining the world’s No.1 social network. A Facebook spokeswoman said that Lockhart is leaving because he decided he wanted to remain on the East Coast, and did not want to move to California, where Facebook is headquartered. Lockhart’s last day at Facebook has not yet been determined. The Facebook spokeswoman said the company hopes to continue to work with Lockhart as an independent consultant. Lockhart was the chief spokesman and senior adviser to President Clinton between 1998 and 2000, and co-founded the Glover Park Group communications firm in 2001. Facebook, which announced on Thursday that it had surpassed a billion monthly active users, ranks among the Web’s most popular destinations alongside websites owned by Google Inc , Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc. But the company has faced a rough reception on Wall Street, as concerns about its slowing revenue growth rate has cut its market valuation by more than 40 percent. Shares of Facebook were down 2.6 percent at $21.37 in midday trading on Friday. In June, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Bret Taylor announced that he would leave the company, and Facebook’s director of platform partnerships and its director of product management have also departed in recent months. News of Lockhart’s move was first reported by the technology blog AllThingsD.com."
2014-04-24,0,"Facebook is teaming up with News Corp’s Storyful, the media tool that verifies and manages copyright of news and video on social media platforms like Twitter. “News is finding a bigger audience on Facebook than ever before, and journalists and media organizations have become an integral part of Facebook,” wrote Andy Mitchell, director of news and global media partnership at Facebook, in a blog post announcing FB Newswire. Social media platforms have become a gold mine for journalists. Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and others are rich in source material, as many people around the world use them to communicate, including during periods of upheaval. Acknowledging that many journalists use Twitter to uncover material, Facebook is also providing a Twitter feed, @FBNewswire. “We work closely with our news partners and as we look at the opportunities clearly Facebook was being used as a place to gather news,” Mitchell said in an interview with Reuters. Facebook’s newsfeed, where people post stories, status updates and photos, is an integral part of the company’s revenue growth and it injects paid marketing messages straight into the news stream. On Wednesday, Facebook reported a 72 percent increase in revenue to $2.5 billion during the first quarter because of a surge in advertising. "

2015-01-08,-1,"Facebook and QuickFire did not disclose the terms of the deal. Facebook’s acquisition of the video technology company comes a day after it said in a blog it averaged more than 1 billion video views every day since June 2014.  "
2012-03-02,-1,"Last September, Facebook increased its credit line to $2.5 billion. One of the sources said that the credit line may be increased to about $5 billion in the future. In February 2011, Facebook set up a $1.5 billion credit agreement with affiliates of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Capital, the leading underwriters of the company’s IPO. Facebook plans to increase its credit line to help cover a tax bill related to employee stock awards that will vest soon after it goes public. On February 1, Facebook filed regulatory documents for an IPO. Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that Facebook would add banks to its roster of IPO underwriters. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives for Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Credit Suisse also declined to comment. "

2015-08-12,1,"But so far, the payoff has been small: Facebook earns 15 cents per user in India every quarter, compared to the $7 to $8 it makes on each U.S. user, according to analysts. Facebook does not break out its revenues in India, but Neil Shah, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, a Hong Kong-based technology consulting firm, estimates it brings in $15 million a quarter, far behind the $350 million he estimates Google earns there per quarter. Google, which set up in India in 2004, has been in the Indian market six years longer than Facebook, and its search ads are more familiar to advertisers there than the display ads Facebook offers. The business-boosting features, described to Reuters by company executives and Indian business people, are aimed at advertisers such as Mohit Khattar, managing director at online grocery company Godrej Nature’s Basket, one of the roughly 60 to 65 million small- and medium-sized businesses in the country. He said he began advertising on Facebook about two months ago as the company ramped up its online presence. He found that advertising in-store events and sales helped attract customers, but would not provide specific figures. “Since our customers are on Facebook, we are on Facebook. It’s that simple,” Khattar said. Facebook declined to say how many staff members it has in India or how much it has invested since it launched operations there in 2010.  But the world’s largest social network says it has seen early signs its efforts are working. The company unveiled a new type of ad designed specifically for India last year, called “click to missed call.” Users click a button on an ad, which automatically calls an advertiser. The user hangs up - to save them the charge for the call - and the advertiser calls back with a pre-recorded message. Garnier Men, a leading men’s hair care company in India and a unit of beauty products giant L‘Oreal SA, saw online sales more than double by using click to missed call, according to Facebook and the company. “Advertisers in India are not warmed enough to social media as a concept of marketing,” said Shah, the Counterpoint analyst.  “We really need to help them see how Facebook pages and advertising will help grow their businesses,” said Andy Hwang, Facebook director of small- and medium-sized businesses for Asia Pacific. For instance, the company advises businesses to create interactive Facebook pages and use Facebook Messenger to interact with customers as a way of increasing sales. Technology companies have turned to India and other markets in Asia for growth because the region contains two-thirds of the world’s population. Asia is Facebook’s fastest-growing region, with 57 percent year-over-year growth in monthly active users. India alone has 1.3 billion people, second only to China, and Facebook increased the number of users there by 22 percent last year. On the other hand, only 252 million people in India have Internet access. Expansion in India is also important because of the “China factor.” Facebook, like Google Inc and Twitter Inc, is shut out of the biggest market of all due to the Communist government’s concerns over control of information. Other tech companies, such as eBay and Yahoo, have struggled to crack the Chinese market. Getting more Indian users “drives success, or at least the perception of success,” said Jaideep Mehta, vice president and general manager for International Data Corporation Southeast Asia. Facebook said it plans to use its strategy in India for other emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, which are Facebook’s third-, fourth- and fifth-largest markets by users. That makes success in India even more important for its global expansion. For the second quarter of this year, 51.3 percent of Facebook’s $4 billion in revenue came from outside the U.S. and Canada. In addition to efforts to attract more Indian advertisers, Facebook is working to make it easier for users to get on the service. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s Indian users access it through mobile phones, but the Facebook app uses more data than most are able to pay for and Internet connections can be patchy. So the social giant developed Facebook Lite, which uses less data, for India and other emerging markets.   It has also rolled out its Internet.org initiative in India, a program started in August 2013 that aims to connect the two-thirds of the world without Internet access. Many of India’s advertising dollars are in rural and semi-urban cities, analysts said, where users do not have a reliable Internet connection.  Facebook is also getting help from the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which uses Facebook to provide updates on the government’s workings.  “It is undeniable that a pro-social media government is good for the industry,” Mehta said.

2012-08-22,-2,"Under the terms of the deal, Facebook will acquire Instagram for $300 million in cash and roughly 23 million shares of Facebook common stock. The deal is currently valued at $747.1 million, based on the $19.44 closing price of Facebook’s shares on Wednesday. Shares of the world’s No.1 online social network have declined roughly 50 percent since the company’s highly-anticipated initial public offering in May. Slowing revenue growth and a flood of insider shares that could hit the market in the coming months are among investors’ key concerns. The Instagram application, which allows users to add filters and effects to pictures taken on their smartphones, could bolster Facebook’s mobile efforts -- an area that is considered something of a weak spot for the company. The deal also ensures that the fast-growing mobile app, which said it had 80 million users in July, will not fall into the hands of a Facebook rival such as Twitter or Google Inc. Still, the price that Facebook paid for the two-year-old company, which doesn’t have any revenue, stunned analysts and investors. Facebook said in its most recent 10Q regulatory filing that it plans to maintain Instagram’s products “as independent mobile applications to enhance our photos product offerings and to enable users to increase their levels of mobile engagement and photo sharing.” Facebook did not provide a further update on the timing of the deal on Wednesday, but said it was pleased the FTC has cleared the transaction. Facebook had initially said it expected the deal to close in the second quarter, but later changed the time frame, saying it expected the deal to close by the end of the year. Facebook is scheduled to appear at a so-called “fairness hearing” before the California Department of Corporations on August 29. The hearing, which provides California-based companies with an alternative to registering shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could expedite the transfer of Facebook shares to Instagram, potentially making it possible for the deal to close as soon as next week. "
2016-08-29,-4,"“Facebook has an immensely important economic position and just like every other large enterprise it has a immensely important social responsibility.” The German government has been critical of Facebook in the past. Political leaders and regulators have complained the world’s largest social network, with 1.6 billion monthly users, had been slow to respond to hate speech and anti-immigrant messages. Last year Justice Minister Heiko Maas told Reuters that Facebook must abide by stricter German laws banning racist sentiment even if it might be allowed in the United States under freedom of speech. De Maiziere said he recognized Facebook’s efforts to develop software that can better identify outlawed content and praised its efforts to fight child pornography. He said it was right to warn users in its terms against the dissemination of illegal content. Eva-Maria Kirschsieper, Facebook’s head of Public Policy in Germany, told reporters during de Maiziere’s visit that the discussions between political leaders and companies in social media would continue.   Mark Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who now heads the Counter Extremist Project (CEP) in New York, a non-profit group that maintains a database of information about extremist groups, said Facebook was a leader in the social media sector in combating extremism, but more work was needed. ”Of all the companies, Facebook has done the most, but they’re all just starting to recognize that the weaponization of social media platforms is not good business and not good for society,” Wallace told Reuters. CEP is completing testing of a new software tool that will identify new images and videos published on social media sites by Islamic State and other extremist groups, and remove them instantly wherever they occur, much as already done with child pornography images. Earlier this year, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg came to Berlin to respond to the criticism. He said he had learned from Facebook’s experience in Germany that migrants were a group of people who also needed to be protected from hate speech online. "
2012-04-10,0,"By acquiring Instagram - in a deal announced days after the startup closed a funding round that valued it at $500 million - Facebook may also have sought to absorb a potential rival or at least prevent it from falling into the hands of a major competitor like Twitter or Google Inc. “Anytime you see a social platform that’s growing that quickly, that’s got to be cause to be nervous,” said Paul Buchheit, a partner at the start-up incubator program Y Combinator and a co-founder of FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired in 2009. “It would be better to have bought Twitter at this stage,” he said of Facebook. “So if you’re thinking this could be the next Twitter, it could be a smart thing to do.” The Instagram application, which allows users to add filters and effects to pictures taken on their iPhone and Android devices and to share those photos with their friends, has gained about 30 million users since it launched in January 2011. Instagram says that as of the end of 2011, its users had uploaded some 400 million photos or about 60 pix per second, suggesting the sort of activity that Facebook seeks as it tries to wring revenue from mobile devices. Instagram launched its Android app just last week, garnering more than one million downloads already. As Instagram’s popularity has shot up in recent months, the company’s leadership has mulled possible strategies to expand the service into a fully featured social network - much like a photo-driven, stripped-down version of Facebook, Twitter, or even Path, a company insider said. Instagram is “a property that would have been amazingly valuable to not just Facebook, certainly Twitter was in the hunt as well,” said Lou Kerner, founder of the Social Internet Fund. “I‘m sure Google was interested as well. So to some degree an acquisition like this is both offensive and defensive. It would be a highly leveragable asset for anybody who wanted to compete against Facebook.” Instagram, with roughly a dozen employees based in San Francisco, closed a $50 million funding round last week from investors including Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners, according to a source familiar with the matter. The funding valued the company, founded in early 2010, at $500 million, it said. Facebook, which is expected to raise $5 billion via the largest Silicon Valley initial public offering by May, will acquire Instagram’s entire team. “This is an important milestone for Facebook because it’s the first time we’ve ever acquired a product and company with so many users,” Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post. “We don’t plan on doing many more of these, if any at all.” The deal, a closely kept secret at the tiny start-up, is expected to close this quarter. CEO Kevin Systrom announced the transaction to Instagram employees at a 9 a.m. meeting on Monday, according to the source inside Instagram. TAKING PAGE FROM GOOGLE‘S BOOK Instagram, however, will not only remain running, but Facebook will build features into it as time goes by, both companies said. Tech industry insiders were quick to draw parallels with Google’s $1.65 billion acquisition of video service YouTube in 2006. YouTube retains its own offices in San Bruno, California, and largely operates independently of Google. “Facebook is acquiring a similar company in that it’s fast growing, doesn’t have revenue or a business model, but has become part of the online culture,” said Gartner analyst Ray Valdes. “I would wager that almost everyone is also a Facebook user, so it’s not like they’re expanding their market,” Valdes said of Facebook. “What they’re buying is traction, they’re buying engagement, they’re buying brand value.” With its purchase, Facebook said it would continue to develop Instagram as an independent app that remains compatible with other social networking services. “We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on Facebook,” Zuckerberg wrote. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011, and ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, according to its prospectus. While it was not immediately clear what portion of the Instagram acquisition price Facebook paid in cash, the price represents an “extraordinary” valuation, said Paul Deninger, senior managing director of investment banking firm Evercore Partners. “There are no obvious traditional valuation metrics that justify this price,” he said, though he noted that that did not mean that it would be a bad deal for Facebook. Some tech industry observers noted that deal may dramatically ramp up the valuations on other fast-growing social media companies and app-makers - such as Pinterest - as entrenched Web players seek to snap up attractive assets and bolster their social capabilities to challenge Facebook. “It will be interesting because if Facebook has to keep buying up the hot new social network, that could get expensive after a while,” said Y Combinator’s Buchheit. "
2012-05-15,1,"GM said it will still have Facebook pages marketing its vehicles, but it will drop use of paid ads. Anyone can create a Facebook page at no cost. GM pays no fee to Facebook for its pages, which allow the automaker to reach consumers directly. “We regularly review our overall media spend and make adjustments as needed...it’s not unusual for us to move our spending around various media outlets - especially with the growth of multiple social and digital media outlets,” GM said in a statement. “In terms of Facebook specifically, while we currently do not plan to continue with advertising, we remain committed to an aggressive content strategy through all of our products and brands, as it continues to be a very effective tool for engaging with our customers,” GM said. GM spends about $40 million on its Facebook presence, but only about $10 million of that is paid to Facebook for advertising. The rest covers the creation of content and the agencies involved, The Journal said. GM, the country’s third largest advertiser behind Procter & Gamble Co and AT&T Inc, spent $1.11 billion on U.S. ads last year, according to Kantar Media, an ad-tracking firm owned by WPP PLC. About $271 million of GM’s total ad spend last year was for online display and search ads excluding Facebook advertising. Facebook Inc, founded eight years ago by Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room, is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday. The world’s No. 1 social networking site raised its price range on Monday, potentially giving the company a valuation of more than $100 billion. "
2012-02-17,-8,"Glenn Mangham, 26, a software development student, admitted infiltrating Facebook from his bedroom at his parents’ house in York in northern England last year, sparking fears at the U.S. company that it was dealing with major industrial espionage. “This was the most extensive and flagrant incidence of social media hacking to be brought before British courts,” said Alison Saunders, London’s Chief Prosecutor. “Fortunately, this did not involve any personal user data being compromised.” Facebook first became aware of a security breach in its internal network in April and called in the FBI. The U.S. agents established the source of the hacking was based in Britain and British police raided Mangham’s home in June. Mangham said he had previously helped search engine Yahoo Inc improve its security and wanted to do the same for Facebook. However, prosecutors rejected his explanation. “He said he wanted a mini project and chose Facebook because of its high-profile internet presence,” prosecutor Sandip Patel told London’s Southwark Crown Court. “The prosecution does not accept that the defendant’s actions were anything other than malicious.” The court was told Facebook spent $200,000 in dealing with his actions, the Press Association reported. Judge Alistair McCreath told Mangham his actions were not harmless and had “real consequences and very serious potential consequences” which could have been “utterly disastrous” for Facebook. “You and others who are tempted to act as you did really must understand how serious this is,” he said."
2012-12-12,-4,"A new privacy “shortcut” in the top-right hand corner of the website provides quick access to key controls such as allowing users to manage who can contact them and to block specific people. The new controls are the latest changes to Facebook’s privacy settings, which have been criticized in the past for being too confusing. Facebook Director of Product Sam Lessin said the changes were designed to increase users’ comfort level on the social network, which has roughly one billion users. “When users don’t understand the concepts and controls and hit surprises, they don’t build the confidence they need,” said Lessin. Facebook, Google Inc and other online companies have faced increasing scrutiny and enforcement from privacy regulators as consumers entrust ever-increasing amounts of information about their personal lives to Web services. In April, Facebook settled privacy charges with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended. Under the settlement, Facebook is required to get user consent for certain changes to its privacy settings and is subject to 20 years of independent audits. Facebook’s Lessin said some users don’t understand that the information they post on their Timeline profile page is not the only personal information about them that may be viewable by others. Improvements to Facebook’s so-called Activity Log will make it easier for users to see at a glance all the information that involves them across the social network. Facebook also said it is changing the way that third-party apps, such as games and music players, get permission to access user data. An app must now provide separate requests to create a personalized service based on a user’s personal information and to post automated messages to the Facebook newsfeed on behalf of a user - previously users agreed to both conditions by approving a single request. The revamped controls follow proposed changes that Facebook has made to its privacy policy and terms of service. The changes would allow Facebook to integrate user data with that of its recently acquired photo-sharing app Instagram, and would loosen restrictions on how members of the social network can contact other members using the Facebook email system. Nearly 600,000 Facebook users voted to reject the proposed changes, but the votes fell far short of the roughly 300 million needed for the vote to be binding, under Facebook’s existing rules. The proposed changes also would eliminate any such future votes by Facebook users. "
2012-01-09,1,"Mercedes-Benz USA is bringing Facebook to its cars, with a special version of the service that is built-in to a new in-vehicle telematics system that will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Accessing Facebook on the road is not the exactly the same as using the social network on a personal computer or a smartphone. The version of Facebook offered in Daimler AG’s Mercedes is stripped down to a limited set of features, specially designed for drivers and centered around the locations of friends and businesses. But according to Facebook Vice President of Partnerships and Platform Marketing Dan Rose, the Mercedes version of Facebook reflects the social networking service’s expansion to a growing list of settings where screens and Internet connections are available. “Now that cars have screens that are intelligent, you would expect that more and more car manufacturers will want to make those screens capable of allowing people to connect with their friends and take advantage of the social context that comes along with that,” Rose said in an interview. “One of the core things that people do on their screens in the car is GPS navigation and the ability to see which of your friends are nearby is something we think will be really interesting for people.” He noted Facebook is also increasingly being integrated into televisions, with various TV manufacturers expected to showcase built-in Facebook integration at CES. DirectTV will show off a new social TV app with Facebook capabilities at CES, allowing people to share what they are watching and to add commentary. But unlike television sets, offering Facebook in motor vehicles involves critical safety considerations, particularly at a time when lawmakers and safety advocates are increasingly focused on distracted driving. The Facebook application displays a variety of standard, pre-written postings that a driver can publish on Facebook with quick taps or turns of a knob. If a particular destination is already entered into the car’s navigation system, the driver can automatically publish a Facebook posting stating they are en route to that destination, along with an estimated time of arrival, based on the current traffic patterns. Drivers can also quickly access a list of friends that are nearby, or restaurants in the vicinity that their friends have “liked” on Facebook. The Mercedes Facebook offering is the result of a collaboration between the two companies that started about six months ago, according to Policano. A Mercedes engineering team based in Palo Alto actually built the Facebook application, with input from Facebook on various aspects. Facebook is one of several specially designed apps, including Google Inc and Yelp, that Mercedes drivers can flip between by turning a knob. The apps are part of Mercedes new mbrace2 telematics system, which features a high-resolution color screen near the dashboard and a high-speed wireless Internet connection. The mbrace2 system will be available with the launch of the 2013 SL-Class Mercedes in the Spring. The company plans to make it a standard feature on all Mercedes 2013 models that will roll out throughout the year. One popular Facebook feature that Mercedes drivers will not get, however, is the ability to play social games such as Zynga Inc’s Farmville. Mercedes’ version of Facebook does not support third-party apps. "

Facebook is one of several specially designed apps, including Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yelp, that Mercedes drivers can flip between by turning a knob. The apps are part of Mercedes new mbrace2 telematics system, which features a high-resolution color screen near the dashboard and a high-speed wireless Internet connection. The mbrace2 system will be available with the launch of the 2013 SL-Class Mercedes in the Spring. The company plans to make it a standard feature on all Mercedes 2013 models that will roll out throughout the year. One popular Facebook feature that Mercedes drivers will not get, however, is the ability to play social games such as Zynga Inc’s (ZNGA.O) Farmville. Mercedes’ version of Facebook does not support third-party apps. "
2016-07-21,-3,"Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) has also poured money into delivering internet access to under served areas through Project Loon, which aims to use a network of high-altitude balloons to made the internet available to remote parts of the world. Yael Maguire, Facebook’s engineering director and head of its Connectivity Lab, said in an interview that the company initially hoped Aquila would fly for 30 minutes.  “We’re thrilled about what happened with our first flight,” Maguire said. “There are still a lot of technical challenges that need to be addressed for us to achieve the whole mission.” He said he hoped the system might be brought into service “in the near future.” Zuckerberg laid out the company’s biggest challenges in flying a fleet of Aquilas, including making the plane lighter so it can fly for longer periods, getting it to fly at 60,000 feet and creating communications networks that allow it to rapidly transfer data and accurately beam down lasers to provide internet connections.  Maguire said Aquila will go through several more test flights and hopes it will soon break the world record for the longest solar-powered unmanned aircraft flight, which currently stands at two weeks.  Facebook, which has more than 1.6 billion users, has invested billions of dollars in getting more people online, both through an initiative called internet.org - which offers a pared-down version of the internet to poor areas - and by building drones.

2012-12-12,-4,"New tools introduced on Wednesday will make it easier for Facebook’s members to quickly determine who can view the photos, comments and other information about them that appears on different parts of the website, and to request that any objectionable photos they’re featured in be removed. A new privacy “shortcut” in the top-right hand corner of the website provides quick access to key controls such as allowing users to manage who can contact them and to block specific people. The new controls are the latest changes to Facebook’s privacy settings, which have been criticized in the past for being too confusing. Facebook Director of Product Sam Lessin said the changes were designed to increase users’ comfort level on the social network, which has roughly one billion users. “When users don’t understand the concepts and controls and hit surprises, they don’t build the confidence they need,” said Lessin. Facebook, Google Inc and other online companies have faced increasing scrutiny and enforcement from privacy regulators as consumers entrust ever-increasing amounts of information about their personal lives to Web services. In April, Facebook settled privacy charges with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it had deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended. Under the settlement, Facebook is required to get user consent for certain changes to its privacy settings and is subject to 20 years of independent audits. Facebook’s Lessin said some users don’t understand that the information they post on their Timeline profile page is not the only personal information about them that may be viewable by others. Improvements to Facebook’s so-called Activity Log will make it easier for users to see at a glance all the information that involves them across the social network. Facebook also said it is changing the way that third-party apps, such as games and music players, get permission to access user data. An app must now provide separate requests to create a personalized service based on a user’s personal information and to post automated messages to the Facebook newsfeed on behalf of a user - previously users agreed to both conditions by approving a single request. The revamped controls follow proposed changes that Facebook has made to its privacy policy and terms of service. The changes would allow Facebook to integrate user data with that of its recently acquired photo-sharing app Instagram, and would loosen restrictions on how members of the social network can contact other members using the Facebook email system. Nearly 600,000 Facebook users voted to reject the proposed changes, but the votes fell far short of the roughly 300 million needed for the vote to be binding, under Facebook’s existing rules. The proposed changes also would eliminate any such future votes by Facebook users. "
2012-06-01,-3,"“Earlier today, some users briefly experienced issues loading the site. The issues have since been resolved and everyone should now have access to Facebook,” company spokesman Michael Kirkland told Reuters. The outages came as Facebook continued to grapple with the fallout of its botched May 18 IPO. The stock has plummeted nearly 23 percent from its IPO price, and numerous lawsuits have been filed in the wake of first-day trading glitches. Shares of Facebook closed up 5 percent at $29.60 Thursday on the Nasdaq."
2012-04-09,3,"As Instagram’s popularity has shot up in recent months, the company’s leadership has mulled possible strategies to expand the service into a fully featured social network - much like a photo-driven, stripped-down version of Facebook, Twitter, or even Path, a company insider said. Instagram is “a property that would have been amazingly valuable to not just Facebook, certainly Twitter was in the hunt as well,” said Lou Kerner, founder of the Social Internet Fund. “I‘m sure Google was interested as well. So to some degree an acquisition like this is both offensive and defensive. It would be a highly leveragable asset for anybody who wanted to compete against Facebook.” The acquisition marks an exception in strategy for Facebook, which has traditionally bought small companies as a means of hiring coveted teams of engineers. Facebook typically discontinues the acquired company’s products or builds similar versions that it integrates into its service. Instagram, however, will not only remain running, but Facebook will build features into it as time goes by, both companies said. The Instagram application, which allows users to add filters and effects to pictures taken on their iPhone and Android devices and to share those photos with their friends, has gained about 30 million users since it launched in January 2011. Instagram, with roughly a dozen employees based in San Francisco, was reportedly in the process of wrapping up a $50 million funding round last week from investors including Sequoia Capital, according to the technology blog AllThingsD.com. The funding valued the company, founded in early 2010, at $500 million, it said. “This is an important milestone for Facebook because it’s the first time we’ve ever acquired a product and company with so many users,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post. “We don’t plan on doing many more of these, if any at all.” The deal, a closely kept secret at the tiny start-up, is expected to close this quarter. CEO Kevin Systrom announced the transaction to Instagram employees at a 9 a.m. meeting on Monday, according to the source inside Instagram. The Instagram deal is expected to resemble Google Inc’s $1.65 billion acquisition of video service YouTube in 2006. YouTube retains its own offices in San Bruno, California, and largely operates independently of Google. The acquisition came as Instagram was in the process of meeting with venture capital firms about raising more funding, according to one source familiar with the matter. “It was not long-planned,” the source said on condition of anonymity, referring to the Facebook acquisition. “What happened is that Facebook must have come in with a number.” In addition to bolstering Facebook’s photo-sharing and mobile capabilities, one side benefit of the deal for Facebook, the source noted, is that it prevents rival Twitter from acquiring the popular app. With its purchase, Facebook said it would continue to develop Instagram as an independent app that remains compatible with other social networking services. “We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on Facebook,” Zuckerberg wrote. "
2012-08-31,-12,"“Newly improved automated efforts will remove those Likes gained by malware, compromised accounts, deceived users, or purchased bulk Likes,” Facebook said in a post on its official blog on Friday. “While we have always had dedicated protections against each of these threats on Facebook, these improved systems have been specifically configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes,” the post continued. Thanks to a growing black market, companies can instantly raise their profile on Facebook by purchasing thousands of Likes at a time - a practice that is forbidden by the No. 1 social network, which has 955 million users. Many of these Likes come from bogus Facebook user accounts rather than genuine users of the social network. Meanwhile, various spam-like programs on Facebook deceive users into unwittingly liking something when they perform another action, such as clicking to watch a video. Facebook said the cleanup will benefit both users and companies that maintain pages on the network, by giving a more accurate measurement of fan count and demographics. Ensuring the integrity of Likes is serious business for Facebook, which depends on advertising revenue from large brands and other businesses. Many of the ad campaigns that companies conduct on Facebook are designed to garner Likes - a sign that their marketing message has resonated with consumers. “It’s their currency,” said Jeremiah Owyang, a partner at research firm Altimeter Group. “Facebook is playing the Federal Reserve, to take the counterfeit currency off the market to ensure that there’s quality in the marketplace.” The problem is not unique to Facebook, say analysts, who note that Twitter and Google Inc also grapple with fake accounts, spam and other techniques to game the service. But for Facebook, the pressure to show that activity on its social network is genuine has grown as concerns have mounted on Wall Street about the company’s long-term profit potential. Shares of Facebook set a new low on Friday, falling as much as 5.3 percent to $18.08, after brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. Facebook has lost more than 50 percent of its market value since its initial public offering in May. Facebook estimates that 1.5 percent of its users are “undesirable” accounts set up for purposes that violate its terms of service, according to its most recent 10-Q regulatory filing. “I think what they’re intending to do is get a handle on it before it gets really out of control,” Brian Blau, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said. “You can imagine no business wants to pay for advertising to fake accounts.” "
2012-05-23,-6,"Firsthand Technology Value Fund and GSV Capital Corp, two closed-end funds that bought shares of the social media company before the IPO, have taken a beating, used as proxies for betting against Facebook. “Until investors can actually short Facebook, they have to keep shorting things that can give them some sort of proxy for Facebook,” said Thomas Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, which owns shares in both closed-end funds. Firsthand has fallen 26 percent in the three trading days since Facebook went public at $38 a share. GSV has lost 27 percent. Investors have turned to funds such as Firsthand and GSV as a proxy to bet against Facebook because it is difficult to borrow shares of the company to sell short so soon after the IPO. Traditional mutual funds that own Facebook cannot be shorted. Because both Firsthand and GSV are designated as “business development companies” under securities rules, they can invest like venture capital funds while taking money from public investors and trading on an exchange like other closed-end funds. As a result, they can serve as tools for short-sellers. Some shorters sprang into action even before the Facebook IPO last Thursday. The number of GSV shares sold short had soared to 1.56 million as of April 30, the most recent figure available, from just 103,280 at December 30, Nasdaq data show. Short shares of Firsthand jumped to 29,588 from 300 over the same period. The sell-off in Firsthand and GSV is out of proportion with their holdings of Facebook, which closed at $31 a share on Tuesday, down 18.4 percent from the IPO price. Firsthand on Monday reported it held 600,000 Facebook shares acquired ahead of the IPO at an average cost of $31.50 each, or $18.9 million. At Tuesday’s closing price, the stake was worth about $18.6 million - still about 9 percent of the fund’s estimated gross assets. Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand fund, said he is optimistic about Facebook’s future, noting that the recent drop in the fund’s share price pales next to the beating he took running a technology fund as the Internet bubble burst a decade ago. “This is nothing,” he said. Landis did not blame short sellers for driving down the fund’s shares, saying it could be because investors wanted exposure to Facebook and switched from the fund to actual shares of Facebook after the IPO. GSV, in a recent securities filing, said it owned $11.2 million worth of Facebook shares, or 9 percent of its total investments of $121.2 million, as of May 4. GSV managers were not immediately available for comment. Vandeventer, of Tocqueville Opportunity, noted that the Firsthand fund was trading under $20 while it had cash of $19.93 a share. “Basically, you could buy Facebook for free,” he said. "
2015-11-05,1,"Facebook had earlier tied up with nine news publishers to launch “Instant Articles”, which publishes their content directly to the social network’s mobile news feeds. The company’s new app will compete with Twitter Inc’s recently launched service called Moments, which aims to provide a better way of curating and aggregating content for users and help them follow live events. Facebook was not immediately available to comment. Shares of the company, which is set to report quarterly earnings after market close on Wednesday, were up 1.2 percent at $103.8 on the Nasdaq. "
2015-12-13,-16,"A Facebook spokesman said nobody was injured in the incident. He said he could not immediately comment on the possible motive for the act of vandalism.  The European head of Facebook is under investigation in Germany over the social network’s alleged failure to remove racist hate speech. The investigation was announced last month as German politicians and celebrities voiced concern about the rise of anti-foreigner comments in German on Facebook and other social media as the country struggles to cope with a refugee influx. Martin Ott, Facebook’s managing director for northern, central and eastern Europe based in Hamburg, may be held responsible for the social platform’s failure to remove hate speech, a spokeswoman for the prosecution said last month. A Facebook spokesperson last month declined to comment on the investigation, adding “we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees.” Facebook has a partnership with a group called FSM, which monitors multimedia service providers on a voluntary basis, and has said it would encourage its users to push back against racism.

2015-01-05,-1,"Facebook said it acquired wit.ai on Monday, without providing a price for the deal. The 18-month old company, based in Palo Alto, California, makes software that can understand spoken words as well as written text phrased in “natural language.” A Facebook representative declined to provide details on how Facebook planned to use the technology or with which group within Facebook the wit.ai team would work. The deal comes as technology companies are racing to bring Internet connectivity to a new crop of devices, from watches to washing machines. Voice recognition, the technology that helps power services such as Apple Inc’s Siri, is considered a key building block for the new devices to earn mainstream consumer appeal. Facebook, the world’s largest Internet social network, with 1.3 billion users, is increasingly looking beyond the PCs, tablets and smartphones currently used to access its service. In March, it acquired virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR for $2 billion. The deal for wit.ai is likely to have been significantly smaller. Wit.ai announced in October that it had raised $3 million in a funding round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.   (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

Facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the Messenger app, which has more than 600 million users. Forty different apps will be available on Messenger in the coming days, allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations, Facebook said.

2014-02-19,-1,"But it underscores Facebook’s determination to win the market for messaging, an indispensable utility in a mobile era. Combining text messaging and social networking, messaging apps provide a quick way for smartphone users to trade everything from brief texts to flirtatious pictures to YouTube clips — bypassing the need to pay wireless carriers for messaging services. And it helps Facebook tap teens who will eschew the mainstream social networks and prefer WhatsApp and rivals such as Line and WeChat, which have exploded in size as mobile messaging takes off. “People are calling them ‘Facebook Nevers,'” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed and an early investor in Snapchat. WhatsApp is adding about a million users per day, Facebook co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on his page on Wednesday. “WhatsApp will complement our existing chat and messaging services to provide new tools for our community,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “Since WhatsApp and (Facebook) Messenger serve such different and important users, we will continue investing in both.” Smartphone-based messaging apps are now sweeping across North America, Asia and Europe. “Communication is the one thing that you have to use daily, and it has a strong network effect,” said Jonathan Teo, an early investor in Snapchat, another red-hot messaging company that flirted year ago with a multibillion dollar acquisition offer from Facebook. Even so, he balked at the price tag. As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jan Koum will join Facebook’s board, and the social network will grant an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp’s founders, including Koum. That is on top of the $16 billion in cash and stock that Facebook will pay. Facebook said on Wednesday it will pay $4 billion in cash and about $12 billion in stock in its single largest acquisition, dwarfing the $1 billion it paid for photo-sharing app Instagram. The price paid for Instagram, which with just 30 million users was already considered overvalued by many observers at the time. Facebook promised to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash break-up fee if the deal falls through. Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatsApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal. "
2012-02-02,-5,"“The size of our user base and our users’ level of engagement are critical to our success,” Facebook said in its SEC filing for an initial public offering. Quoting industry data that there were two billion Internet users globally, it said: “We aim to connect all of them.” Growth is held back in the rest of the world, either because of limited Internet penetration, or because those who want a Facebook account already have one. In markets such as the United States or Britain, where more than half of the population already have accounts, user accounts grew less than 2 percent in the past six months, data from Internet metrics service Socialbakers Ltd show. Over the same period, Facebook gained a third of its users in India. Countries like India are where Facebook is looking for growth: even though India is now home to the second-largest Facebook community in the world, less than 4 percent of Indians have an account. Social networks are not new to India: for several years Google dominated with its Orkut service, but since mid 2010 has been in retreat. Google’s own estimates show traffic to Orkut.co.in fell from 3 million unique visitors per day to less than 1 million in the past year. Facebook, meanwhile, has risen from 6 million to 13 million over the same period. Partly this was because Orkut failed to add new features to keep users engaged, said Amit Agarwal, a long-time Indian blogger and columnist. But there’s also a generational shift taking place, he said. Orkut has primarily been for teenagers and students, he said, whereas attend any social gathering in urban India today and you will hear moms and dads asking to be tagged on any Facebook photos posted. “That’s a sea change,” he said. And Indians are passionate users. Of some 3,000 students and employees in 14 countries surveyed by network equipment manufacturer Cisco late last year, more Indians check their Facebook page at least once a day -- 92 percent of those surveyed -- than any other country surveyed. Legal sources say the case has a good chance of being taken to the Supreme Court regardless of the ruling. Facebook, Google and others would be forced to monitor each post if the court order is upheld, said a source close to one of the companies fighting to have the case thrown out. “It would be impossible to do that,” he said. India’s proportionally small Facebook community -- 4 percent of the population compared to 29 percent in the Philippines or 27 percent in Thailand -- offers room for growth, assuming that Internet access also grows. Some 80 percent of the population is not yet Internet savvy, said Asheesh Raina, principal research analyst at Gartner Inc. That means the potential for Facebook has no limit, Raina says, “for the next five years.” But it’s not quite clear what happens after that. Perhaps a model for how India may fare can be found in Indonesia. Until recently it had more users than India, despite having only a quarter of its population and about a third of its Internet users. But some in Indonesia say Facebook needs to be more proactive if it wants to see growth continuing at the same clip. Social-media strategist Enda Nasution said that part of the problem is the distraction offered by rivals: Twitter, for example, has its fifth largest user base in Indonesia, social media research company Semiocast SAS said. But it’s also about more structural problems. There are more than 40 million Facebook users in Indonesia, which means that according to one calculation, there are now more Facebook users in Indonesia than Internet users. This discrepancy is in part down to how Internet users are defined, and to the growth of mobile Internet usage. But it highlights the limits to further growth in Facebook adoption. To combat this, Nasution said, Facebook needed to start thinking of itself as more of a utility, contributing to the infrastructure that would boost usage. He pointed to a recent initiative by Google to help local enterprises register and set up websites as a way to foster more Internet activity. In its SEC filing, Facebook identified other countries with potential for growth. Brazil has grown even faster than India in the past year, 268 percent against India’s 132 percent. Facebook is also looking to Russia, Japan and South Korea, where it says less than 15 percent of Internet users have Facebook accounts. Neither Asian country is a done deal. While both South Korea and Japan are big Internet users, both already have their own social networks: South Korea has Cyworld, which has about 26 million members against an estimated 12 million for Facebook. Japan has Mixi, with 23 million members against Facebook’s seven million. “We do not know if we will be able to find an approach to managing content and information that will be acceptable to us and to the Chinese government,” it said. Facebook is unlikely to give up trying. It says it has “a dedicated policy team that monitors legal and regulatory developments and works with policymakers and regulators around the world to help ensure that our perspective is heard in matters of importance to us.” To get into China will involve making some major compromises on the way, in terms of allowing China some control over what its users post and read, says David Kirkpatrick, a Fortune columnist and author of “The Facebook Effect,” a history of the website. “I think Zuckerberg knows he has to have China if he’s going to be a truly global Internet service, and as a result he will do whatever he has to do to bring Facebook in here,” Kirkpatrick said in an interview. Options might include partnering with an existing service, or copying a company like Viadeo, a more business-oriented social networking service, says Jon Russell, Asia editor of startup news site The Next Web. France-based Viadeo bought local player Tianji in 2007, giving it a foothold in China, which has now grown to be the group’s biggest market and main focus. “That’s the kind of approach that rumors suggest Facebook would adopt,” says Bangkok-based Russell. Indeed, the growth in services like Tianji illustrate Chinese users’ appetite. Microblog service Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo each boast more than 250 million registered users. Twitter, which is also blocked in China, gets hundreds of millions of unique visits each month from users. While none are Facebook lookalikes, Chinese users are familiar enough with social networking to present a ready market when and if Facebook is unblocked. “Chinese users who are more global and are interested in making contacts overseas, say in the U.S. or Europe, will still be keen on signing on,” says Huang Meng, a Beijing-based analyst with research company Analysys International.

2012-02-01,-4,"Here are a few key issues Facebook outlined as risk factors in its IPO prospectus: ** Facebook usage plateaus: Despite mind-boggling growth in recent years, the number of Internet users in the world is, after all, finite. The social network now has 845 million monthly active users, but warns its growth rate will decline “as the size of our active user base increases, and as we achieve higher market penetration rates.” If Facebook can’t retain users and their attention, then advertising could also peter out. ** Foreign governments restrict access: Facebook has been restricted in China, Iran, North Korea and Syria. That could happen in other countries as well, Facebook warns, in which case “our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access.” ** Regulatory uncertainty: Facebook is subject to laws governing a litany of issues including privacy, intellectual property, data protection. These laws are constantly evolving and could change significantly in a way that could hurt Facebook’s business. “For example..., the interpretation of some laws and regulations that govern the use of names and likenesses in connection with advertising and marketing activities is unsettled.” ** Zynga: The online gaming company accounted for 12 percent of Facebook’s revenue in 2011 and generated considerable Web traffic for the social network. Facebook would take a hit if Zynga games became less popular, or if Zynga began launching games on competing platforms. ** Mobile: Users are increasingly choosing to log onto Facebook through mobile devices, many of which run Google’s Android and Apple Inc’s iOS, operating systems controlled by two of Facebook’s competitors. “Any changes in such systems that degrade our products’ functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect Facebook usage on mobile devices,” the company warns. ** Control is concentrated under Zuckerberg: Before the IPO, CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s shares give him 57 percent of the voting power. Nor is his stake likely to go down significantly after the IPO, given Facebook’s ownership structure. Facebook’s success rests largely with Zuckerberg, but so much control in the hands of one man may be cause for concern to investors. ** Intellectual Property battles: As an Internet company, Facebook expects to be locked in “expensive and time consuming” patent lawsuits, often with “non-practicing entities” that aggressively sue Facebook to extract a settlement. “We presently are involved in many such lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, including in connection with our initial public offering, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,” Facebook says.

2014-08-01,-2,"Some visitors to the site were greeted with a message that read “Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.” It was not immediately clear how widespread the disruption was. Facebook, which has 1.32 billion monthly users, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. "
2016-02-24,-1,"In a video accompanying a blog post, the five new buttons appear as animated emoticons that pop up when the “Like” button is held down on mobile devices. The buttons appear on desktops when users hover over the “Like” button. Facebook launched a pilot of “Reactions” - which allowed users to select from seven emotions including “Angry”, “Sad”, “Wow” and “Like” - in Ireland and Spain in October. The ""Yay"" emoticon, which was present in the pilot launch (on.fb.me/1LBnXIG), was not seen in Wednesday's video (bit.ly/24oZ6yi). “People wanted to express empathy and make it comfortable to share a wider range of emotions,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page.     Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in September the company was thinking of adding a “dislike” button, which spearheaded a debate over whether it would increase cyber bullying and negativity on the site. In October, the company said it would expand its signature “Like” button with various reactions.  The company said it will also use “Reactions” to track user behavior and for ad delivery. ""We will initially use any Reaction similar to a Like to infer that you want to see more of that type of content,"" Facebook said in a separate blog post.(bit.ly/1TFzfOC) The feature received mixed reviews from users on social networking sites. Many complained that they could not see the new emoticons, while some were unhappy that Facebook did not launch a “dislike” button. Marina Cupo wrote on Facebook: “I would rather have had a DISLIKE button and then attach an emotion instead if I want!” Users have often responded negatively to similar changes on other sites. Twitter, for example, replaced its star-shaped “favorite” icon with a heart-shaped icon called “like” in November. Users initially scorned the change, but Twitter later said it increased activity on the site.   "
2015-03-16,-8,"While Facebook has long forbidden groups it deems to be terrorist organizations from posting content on its service, the company specified that it will remove content that expresses support for such groups or praises their leaders.  Facebook also made clear that images “shared in revenge or without permission,” often referred to as “revenge porn,” are forbidden. But photos of women breastfeeding, post-mastectomy scarring and images of paintings and sculptures with nude figures are permissible.  The clarification comes as social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter Inc grapple with self-regulating technology that is as easily used for harassment and online bullying as it is for sharing sports videos and news articles.  “Having a voice is not some absolute state. It’s not the case that you either have a voice or you don’t,” Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday.  “People rightfully want to know what content we will take down, what controversial content we’ll leave up, and why,” Zuckerberg wrote.  Images of graphic violence and nudity have long been problematic for Facebook.  In 2013, Facebook said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site after a video of a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico prompted an outcry. The company has also been criticized for allowing pages that glorify violence against women. Militant groups such as Islamic State have increasingly used social media to spread their message.  Facebook also said on Sunday that it recorded a slight increase in government requests for account data in the second half of 2014.  Requests for account data increased to 35,051 in the second half of 2014 from 34,946 in the first half, with requests from countries such as India rising and those from others, including the United States and Germany, falling.

2015-08-12,1,"But so far, the payoff has been small: Facebook earns 15 cents per user in India every quarter, compared to the $7 to $8 it makes on each U.S. user, according to analysts. Facebook does not break out its revenues in India, but Neil Shah, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, a Hong Kong-based technology consulting firm, estimates it brings in $15 million a quarter, far behind the $350 million he estimates Google earns there per quarter. Google, which set up in India in 2004, has been in the Indian market six years longer than Facebook, and its search ads are more familiar to advertisers there than the display ads Facebook offers. The business-boosting features, described to Reuters by company executives and Indian business people, are aimed at advertisers such as Mohit Khattar, managing director at online grocery company Godrej Nature’s Basket, one of the roughly 60 to 65 million small- and medium-sized businesses in the country. He said he began advertising on Facebook about two months ago as the company ramped up its online presence. He found that advertising in-store events and sales helped attract customers, but would not provide specific figures. “Since our customers are on Facebook, we are on Facebook. It’s that simple,” Khattar said. But other advertisers are still sceptical of the medium. Sumant Kasliwal, CEO of online clothing retailer 20dresses.com, uses ads on the social media site to reach potential customers between 18 and 35, but says he would prefer to advertise on TV. “In India, TV still has the most reach, so if you have the money you would want to be on that,” he said.  Facebook declined to say how many staff members it has in India or how much it has invested since it launched operations there in 2010.  But the world’s largest social network says it has seen early signs its efforts are working. The company unveiled a new type of ad designed specifically for India last year, called “click to missed call.” Users click a button on an ad, which automatically calls an advertiser. The user hangs up - to save them the charge for the call - and the advertiser calls back with a pre-recorded message. Garnier Men, a leading men’s hair care company in India and a unit of beauty products giant L‘Oreal SA, saw online sales more than double by using click to missed call, according to Facebook and the company. “Advertisers in India are not warmed enough to social media as a concept of marketing,” said Shah, the Counterpoint analyst.  “We really need to help them see how Facebook pages and advertising will help grow their businesses,” said Andy Hwang, Facebook director of small- and medium-sized businesses for Asia Pacific. For instance, the company advises businesses to create interactive Facebook pages and use Facebook Messenger to interact with customers as a way of increasing sales. Facebook says it has more than 1.5 million pages created by small and medium businesses in India, a figure that grew 70 percent over the last year. Technology companies have turned to India and other markets in Asia for growth because the region contains two-thirds of the world’s population. Asia is Facebook’s fastest-growing region, with 57 percent year-over-year growth in monthly active users. India alone has 1.3 billion people, second only to China, and Facebook increased the number of users there by 22 percent last year. On the other hand, only 252 million people in India have Internet access. Expansion in India is also important because of the “China factor.” Facebook, like Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), is shut out of the biggest market of all due to the Communist government’s concerns over control of information. Other tech companies, such as eBay and Yahoo, have struggled to crack the Chinese market. Getting more Indian users “drives success, or at least the perception of success,” said Jaideep Mehta, vice president and general manager for International Data Corporation Southeast Asia. Facebook said it plans to use its strategy in India for other emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, which are Facebook’s third-, fourth- and fifth-largest markets by users. That makes success in India even more important for its global expansion. For the second quarter of this year, 51.3 percent of Facebook’s $4 billion in revenue came from outside the U.S. and Canada. In addition to efforts to attract more Indian advertisers, Facebook is working to make it easier for users to get on the service. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s Indian users access it through mobile phones, but the Facebook app uses more data than most are able to pay for and Internet connections can be patchy. So the social giant developed Facebook Lite, which uses less data, for India and other emerging markets.   It has also rolled out its Internet.org initiative in India, a programme started in August 2013 that aims to connect the two-thirds of the world without Internet access. Many of India’s advertising dollars are in rural and semi-urban cities, analysts said, where users do not have a reliable Internet connection.  Facebook is also getting help from the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which uses Facebook to provide updates on the government’s workings.  “It is undeniable that a pro-social media government is good for the industry,” Mehta said. "
2013-03-06,1,"A former president of product development at Roche Group-owned biotechnology company Genentech, Desmond-Hellman also sits on the board of directors of Procter & Gamble Co. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg cited Desmond-Hellman’s experience shaping public policy and operating public companies. Desmond-Hellman will serve on the board effective immediately, but will have to be elected by shareholders, along with the other Facebook directors, at the company’s annual meeting in June. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg joined Facebook’s board in June 2012, a month after the company’s rocky initial public offering. The world’s No. 1 online social network became the only U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion. But its shares plunged more than 50 percent in the months after the IPO on concerns about its long-term money making prospects. Facebook shares have rebounded roughly 56 percent from their 52-week low, finishing Wednesday’s regular trading session at $27.45. "
2012-11-20,0,"Interpublic said it expects to record a pre-tax gain of $94 million. It had recorded a pre-tax gain of $132.2 million for the third quarter of last year from the sale of half of its 0.4 percent stake in Facebook. Interpublic paid less than $5 million for the stake in 2006. Shares of Facebook, which debuted with a market value of more than $100 billion in May, have lost nearly half their value since then on concerns about money-making prospects. “We decided to sell our remaining shares in Facebook as our investment was no longer strategic in nature,” Chief Executive Michael Roth said in a statement. Interpublic also authorized an increase in its existing share repurchase program to $400 million from $300 million. The company repurchased shares worth $151 million, as of Sept. 30. Shares of the company were up 1 percent at $10 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Facebook shares were marginally up at $23.00 on the Nasdaq."
2012-07-20,-5,"With a rich multiple that gave Facebook the distinction of being the first U.S. company to go public with a valuation of more than $100 billion, the company headed by 28-year-old Mark Zuckerberg has little room for error. “If they miss, it would be catastrophic for the stock,” said Michael Binger, a portfolio manager with Gradient Investments. “This is a very important earnings quarter for them. It will establish in people’s minds how they think of the company,” said Binger, whose firm does have a position in Facebook. The bar has been lowered since Facebook warned that a shift in users to mobile devices - where its ability to earn revenue is still nascent - will hinder growth in the short run. Analysts, on average, expect revenue in the second quarter to grow 28 percent to $1.15 billion. During the same period a year ago, Facebook more than doubled its revenue. With Facebook’s stock still trading at three-quarters its $38 IPO price, executives need to address a litany of concerns about the business, such as the efficacy of its online ads and the company’s nascent efforts in mobile advertising. Investors say Facebook is unlikely to be able to deliver the sort of numbers that can propel its stock back to debut levels, but the risk of triggering a slide if the company disappoints Wall Street is high. Facebook’s stock still trades at a rich 57 times forward earnings, compared with Apple Inc’s 13 times and Google Inc’s 14 times. “Facebook is probably going to come up with one or two revolutionary streams that are going to bump up its revenue,” said Bill Lee, an angel investor who backed companies, including electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc and social media site Posterous, which was recently acquired by Twitter. But “all the magic they can continue to deliver is already priced in.” The three lead underwriters of the IPO - Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan - forecast second-quarter earnings per share of between 10 cents and 11 cents, lower than the Street average of 12 cents, minus IPO-related stock compensation charges, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Thomson Reuters StarMine’s SmartEstimates suggests that Facebook will post adjusted earnings of 10.4 cents per share. “It gets back to ‘How predictable are these companies’ results going to be when I‘m forecasting out pretty significant growth to be able to justify the valuation?'” said Ryan Jacob, chairman and chief investment officer of Jacob Funds, who does not own Facebook shares. Facebook, which generated more than four-fifths of its revenue from advertising in 2011, has stepped up efforts to rebuild its revenue momentum, rolling out a raft of new advertising features and providing more details about the effectiveness of its ads. TBG Digital, which helps marketers advertise on Facebook, released a study this week that found the average price of Facebook ads had jumped 58 percent since last year. That is partially due to recently released mobile formats, it found. “Our clients aren’t spending 75 percent of their budgets on Facebook,” said David Jones, Global CEO of advertising agency Havas. But he noted that “there are very few clients who we are talking to who are negative on Facebook.” For Facebook, the first date with Wall Street will mark an important test for the company’s top brass to try to dispel some of the skepticism. Investors will want to hear from Zuckerberg - who wields majority control - but the company has not said if he will take questions on the day. “A miss is a miss and it wouldn’t be good either way, especially for your first quarter out of the gate,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Robert W. Baird. But the context will be key. “If it’s related to shift in mobile, but the mobile monetization is improving, that’s different than just a miss because advertisers are leaving Facebook.” And he said that many investors will be particularly interested in the trends the company is seeing as marketers take advantage of Facebook’s mobile and other advertising features. While most expect Facebook to follow the lead of Google and Amazon.com Inc and abstain from offering financial forecasts every quarter, it may address the current concerns about its business by providing additional color and outlook. “This first time out, I think they have to give some sort of guidance,” said Robert Bacarella, manager of the Monetta Fund, which does not own Facebook shares. “You pacify the near term and say ‘Here’s where we’re going.’ But then you set the table up to say: ‘We’re thinking about whether or not it’s wise give guidance going forward.” For all Facebook’s efforts to woo Wall Street, the company’s biggest job remains building its relationship with advertisers, such as San Francisco’s Public Bikes. “Whenever we have a new bike shop selling our bikes in a particular city, I’ll run a targeted Facebook campaign” in that city, said Dan Nguyen-Tan, Public Bikes’ vice president of sales and marketing. The ability to reach specific groups of Facebook users based on where they live and their interests - such as healthy lifestyles or environmental interests - is an important advantage of Facebook’s advertising system, Nguyen-Tan said. But he acknowledged that Public Bikes spends more money advertising with Google, where it is easier for the company to reach people interested in buying a bicycle. "

2012-02-03,-1,"The Pew Research Center report, based on a U.S. phone survey, logs and data from November 2010, sheds light on Facebook’s possible long-term popularity as the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg heads for a $5 billion initial public offering. Ahead of the IPO, one concern about Facebook has been that users will simply bore of it after a while, a phenomenon known as “Facebook fatigue.” The Pew research suggests those worries may be unfounded. The longer that people have used Facebook site, the more frequently they hit the “like” button, commented on friends’ content, posted status updates and tagged their friends in photos, the report showed. It also concluded that having more Facebook friends kept users more involved with the social networking site. “The more Facebook friends users have, the more they perform every activity that we explored: friending, liking, private messages, commenting, posting, photo tagging, joining groups and poking,” Pew said regarding the survey by its Internet & American Life project. Facebook users on average can reach 156,569 other network users through friends of friends. The number is skewed by Facebook users with especially large friend lists, and the median is 31,170 people reached through friends of friends. “This examination of people’s activities in a very new realm affirms one of the oldest truths about the value of friendship,” said Lee Rainie, head of Pew’s Internet project. “Those who are socially active have a better shot at getting the help and emotional help they need.” The survey was based on a phone survey of 2,255 U.S. adults that was conducted in November 2010. Respondents were asked to share logs of their Facebook activity, and about 269 respondents let Facebook release data on their use. Facebook says it has 845 million active users today. "
2012-06-01,-3,"The outages came as Facebook continued to grapple with the fallout of its botched May 18 IPO. The stock has plummeted nearly 23 percent from its IPO price, and numerous lawsuits have been filed in the wake of first-day trading glitches. Shares of Facebook closed up 5 percent at $29.60 Thursday on the Nasdaq. "
2012-03-07,-2,"Some users turned to rival service Twitter to vent their frustrations at the outage, which appeared to last for about two hours according to postings. Facebook, which has about 845 million active users worldwide, last month announced plans to raise $5 billion in an IPO expected to value the company at between $75 billion and $100 billion. "
2012-05-14,-2,"The No. 1 social network is scheduled on Thursday to price its shares, which begin trading on Friday. It has stopped taking orders for the IPO two days ahead of schedule. The IPO is already oversubscribed, which is why the social network is closing its books earlier than expected. No decision has been made about raising the proposed offer price for Facebook shares, which are being offered at $28 to $35 each, said the source, who asked not to be identified because discussions with the company are private. If the price range is increased, it will likely be done after final orders come in Tuesday. Given the size of the IPO, the deal’s underwriters are likely to be very cautious about raising the price range, the source said. A host of Wall Street banks are underwriting Facebook’s offering, with Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs serving as leads. "
2012-05-10,-4,"Despite concerns about slowing growth, a lofty valuation and signs the company is having trouble ramping up revenue from mobile advertising, institutional investors have so far indicated demand for more shares than Facebook has available, the source told Reuters. Analysts say the company, which is seeking to raise about $10.6 billion by selling more than 337 million shares at $28 to $35 apiece, may raise that price range if demand turns out to be healthy enough. One large institutional investor had put in a major order for shares on Wednesday and was calling around syndicate desks trying to acquire more, a second source familiar with the IPO’s progress told Reuters, declining to be identified because the details are not public. Facebook declined to comment. The company that began as Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room project is expected to begin trading on May 18 after an IPO that dwarfs the coming-out parties of other tech powerhouses. With 900 million users, it is challenging established Web businesses such as Google and Yahoo Inc for consumers’ online time and advertising dollars. But longer term, analysts say Facebook needs to develop a way to earn money from the increasing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones. Facebook, which makes most of its money from advertising, began offering limited ads on the mobile version of its service only recently."

2012-02-17,-8,"Glenn Mangham, 26, a software development student, admitted infiltrating Facebook from his bedroom at his parents’ house in York in northern England last year, sparking fears at the U.S. company that it was dealing with major industrial espionage. “This was the most extensive and flagrant incidence of social media hacking to be brought before British courts,” said Alison Saunders, London’s Chief Prosecutor. “Fortunately, this did not involve any personal user data being compromised.” Facebook first became aware of a security breach in its internal network in April and called in the FBI. The U.S. agents established the source of the hacking was based in Britain and British police raided Mangham’s home in June. Mangham said he had previously helped search engine Yahoo Inc improve its security and wanted to do the same for Facebook. However, prosecutors rejected his explanation. “He said he wanted a mini project and chose Facebook because of its high-profile internet presence,” prosecutor Sandip Patel told London’s Southwark Crown Court. “The prosecution does not accept that the defendant’s actions were anything other than malicious.” The court was told Facebook spent $200,000 in dealing with his actions, the Press Association reported. Judge Alistair McCreath told Mangham his actions were not harmless and had “real consequences and very serious potential consequences” which could have been “utterly disastrous” for Facebook. “You and others who are tempted to act as you did really must understand how serious this is,” he said.

2012-05-18,0,"Even with 900 million Facebook users, not a single bidder stepped forward with just under eight hours to go in the auction on Friday. M.I.C. Gadget, the seller, on the item description said it released only one run of the bobblehead “due to tremendous pressure from Facebook.” Even before Zuckerberg rang the bell at the Nasdaq on Friday morning to kick off trading in Facebook’s stock, there’s been a parallel trading universe where collectors and speculators have tried to cash in on the Facebook name. The items available include a Mark Zuckerberg hoodie on San Francisco’s Craigslist, purportedly worn by the Facebook chieftain himself, for $1,000. (How one would verify Zuckerberg’s connection to the item outside of DNA tests or sworn, signed statement from Mr. Facebook is another story.) Not everyone managed to get in on the buying frenzy for the Facebook IPO, which priced the shares at $38 a pop. But for almost the same exact same price - an opening bid of $35 plus $3.65 shipping - one lucky eBayer could land an original Facebook prospectus for the sale of 337,415,352 shares, and covering some 200 pages. The sole bid was holding up on Friday with five days to go in the auction. Then there are the fake souvenirs, albeit intentional ones, you can snag for free. Mad Magazine this week posted a bogus Facebook stock certificate, with Zuckerberg’s smiling mug inside an oval dollar-bill frame, with this declaration: “Thank you for funding our ongoing effort to collect and control every single piece of personal information on the Internet.

All ours.” It’s sealed with a thumbs-up icon, too: “The SEC likes this.” Elsewhere in the memorabilia universe, another eBayer sold all five of his Velcro-and-rubber “Like” patches modeled after the Facebook thumbs-up, though at a modest $7.95 apiece. Outside the universe of mass-produced souvenirs on eBay, little if any high-end collectives have surfaced. “Now is simply a rotten time to buy Facebook memorabilia,” says James Halperin, co-chairman of Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas. “The hype is beyond high, yet nothing truly desirable seems to be on the market.” Important paperwork such as signed, original Facebook incorporation papers, or the settlement documents between Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins, would draw buyers with big bucks, he notes. But some see value in many things Facebook. Any piece of paper connected to the Facebook IPO - much like a first-day-of-issue postage stamp - shows a physical, tangible connection to a watershed event in the Information Age, argues Douglas A. McIntyre of the 24/7 Wall Street website. “Even if it’s a receipt from your Merrill Lynch broker that you bought 100 shares on the first day of the IPO is a collectible,” McIntyre says. “It’s evidence that you were there on the first day and bought the first day. I know people who bought Microsoft shares on the first day and are proud of the fact. They consider the stock certificate more valuable than if they were collecting rare coins.” At Harvard, Zuckerberg’s former college haunt, the IPO did little to stimulate any souvenir hunters searching for archival traces of the social media magnate. “People over the last couple of years have come looking for photos, that’s something we’ve had a lot of requests for, but nothing special today,” says Julie Zauzmer, managing editor of the Harvard Crimson, class of 2013. But a cheeky first-year student thought the name appeal would help her sell some used dorm furnishings. Sarah Coughlon, an enterprising 18-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona, who is finishing up her first year at Harvard, put up two ads on Craigslist in May, one for “Mark Zuckerberg’s printer - unopened” for $60 (still available) and one for “Mark Zuckerberg’s college minifridge” for $35 (now sold). Neither are actually his former possessions. “Nobody believed they actually belonged to him,” she said on break from her job on dorm clean-up crew. “But they did come from Harvard.” (The writer is a Reuters contributor.)

2013-01-22,-1,"The researchers found that one in three people felt worse after visiting the site and more dissatisfied with their lives, while people who browsed without contributing were affected the most. “We were surprised by how many people have a negative experience from Facebook with envy leaving them feeling lonely, frustrated or angry,” researcher Hanna Krasnova from the Institute of Information Systems at Berlin’s Humboldt University told Reuters. “From our observations some of these people will then leave Facebook or at least reduce their use of the site,” said Krasnova, adding to speculation that Facebook could be reaching saturation point in some markets. Researchers from Humboldt University and from Darmstadt’s Technical University found vacation photos were the biggest cause of resentment with more than half of envy incidents triggered by holiday snaps on Facebook. Social interaction was the second most common cause of envy as users could compare how many birthday greetings they received to those of their Facebook friends and how many “likes” or comments were made on photos and postings. “Passive following triggers invidious emotions, with users mainly envying happiness of others, the way others spend their vacations and socialize,” the researchers said in the report “Envy on Facebook: A Hidden Threat to Users’ Life Satisfaction?” released on Tuesday. “The spread and ubiquitous presence of envy on Social Networking Sites is shown to undermine users’ life satisfaction.” They found people aged in their mid-30s were most likely to envy family happiness while women were more likely to envy physical attractiveness. These feelings of envy were found to prompt some users to boast more about their achievements on the site run by Facebook Inc. to portray themselves in a better light. Men were shown to post more self-promotional content on Facebook to let people know about their accomplishments while women stressed their good looks and social lives. The researchers based their findings on two studies involving 600 people with the results to be presented at a conference on information systems in Germany in February. The first study looked at the scale, scope and nature of envy incidents triggered by Facebook and the second at how envy was linked to passive use of Facebook and life satisfaction. The researchers said the respondents in both studies were German but they expected the findings to hold internationally as envy is a universal feeling and possibly impact Facebook usage. “From a provider’s perspective, our findings signal that users frequently perceive Facebook as a stressful environment, which may, in the long-run, endanger platform sustainability,” the researchers concluded.

2015-01-05,-1,"A Facebook representative declined to provide details on how Facebook planned to use the technology or with which group within Facebook the wit.ai team would work.  The deal comes as technology companies are racing to bring Internet connectivity to a new crop of devices, from watches to washing machines. Voice recognition, the technology that helps power services such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Siri, is considered a key building block for the new devices to earn mainstream consumer appeal.  Facebook, the world’s largest Internet social network, with 1.3 billion users, is increasingly looking beyond the PCs, tablets and smartphones currently used to access its service. In March, it acquired virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR for $2 billion.  The deal for wit.ai is likely to have been significantly smaller. Wit.ai announced in October that it had raised $3 million in a funding round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. "
2012-06-27,-16,"Of 17 brokerages that issued research reports, only eight recommended that investors buy Facebook shares, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - the Internet company’s three lead underwriters. Eight brokerages gave neutral ratings and one had a “sell” rating. The panoply of neutral or equivalent ratings is notable because Wall Street research analysts have a reputation for favoring “buy” ratings, particularly in the high-profile Internet industry where “buy” or equivalent recommendations outnumber “hold” ratings nearly 2 to 1, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data. “It says there are real questions out there about the strength of this business model, the fundamental strength of this company, together with its valuation,” said Tim Ghriskey, a portfolio manager at Solaris Asset Management. “We’re not buying right now, that’s for sure.” Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent to close at $32.23 on Nasdaq, remaining far below their IPO price of $38. The reports, released by banks involved in the IPO after a 40-day quiet period expired, represent Wall Street’s broadest assessment of Facebook, the first U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion. Banks are required to keep their employees handling IPOs apart from analysts recommending stocks in order to avoid conflicts of interest. The average target stock price for Facebook was $37.64, but the range was wide, from $25 to $45. Morgan Stanley, which has come under scrutiny for its role in driving an IPO price that now appears lofty, set a price target of $38 and “overweight” recommendation. It said it remained unclear how Facebook plans to make money from a growing number of users logging on to the No. 1 social network via smartphones and tablets. “Sell” ratings are rare in stock research, where access to corporate executives is considered crucial. In the IPO, banks sold their clients shares in the company started by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room, at a price equivalent to a whopping 100 times 2011 net income per share. Facebook more recently traded around 65 times expected earnings, according to Solaris’ Ghriskey. That compares with Google Inc’s recent price-to-earnings ratio of about 13. “I respect that a Chinese wall exists, but I think it feeds into the cynicism that Main Street has for Wall Street - that one side of the business was telling them to buy at $38 and the other side of the business now at $32 says we shouldn’t buy it,” said Steve Birenberg, a portfolio manager at North Lake Capital in Winnetka, Illinois. Most analysts expect Facebook’s large user base to help it corner a substantial share of the Internet advertising market in the long term. BMO Capital Markets’ Daniel Salmon began his coverage with an “underperform” recommendation and a $25 target, translating into a nearly 25 percent discount from current levels. “Slowing user growth is one of our primary concerns for Facebook’s current valuation,” said Salmon, the only analyst giving Facebook a negative rating on Wednesday. He estimated Facebook’s annual user growth would be 22 percent next year and 16 percent the year after, much slower than expansion in the past. The 33 banks that participated in the stock listing were required by securities regulators to wait until 40 days after the first day of trading on May 18 before publishing their views, limiting the research on Facebook until now to a handful of analysts. Scott Devitt at lead underwriter Morgan Stanley, who told the firm’s major clients that he had cut his revenue estimates on Facebook just days before the IPO, said he expects Facebook’s ability to turn its mobile features into profit to be a challenge for the next several quarters to several years. He expects revenue to climb 31 percent in 2012, far less than the 88 percent growth in 2011. “No one is debating the potential opportunity in front of Facebook,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors. “However, there is disagreement in the analyst community on the trajectory of the earnings and revenue growth in the coming years. The assumptions analysts are making are guesswork at this point.” Morgan Stanley’s Devitt, BMO’s Salmon and the two lead analysts at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs covering Facebook have all been near the middle of the pack at stock picking over the past two years, according to Thomson Starmine data ranking analysts’ performance. The company’s stock offering, one of the most highly anticipated in history, was marred by a series of technical glitches at the Nasdaq exchange. Facebook’s decision to increase the size of the offering by 25 percent just days ahead of the IPO, as well as concerns about decelerating revenue, also weighed on the stock, which traded as low as $25.52 before regaining some ground to trade in a $31-$33 range in recent days. The rush of research comes ahead of Facebook’s second-quarter results, expected sometime in mid-to-late July. With about 900 million users, Facebook has become one of the Web’s top destinations, challenging established players such as Google and Yahoo Inc. Even so, revenue growth from ads and other services is slowing. The company, which last year was more than doubling the amount of money collected every quarter compared with a year earlier, reported growth of 45 percent in the first three months of 2012, and revenue declined from the preceding quarter. General Motors Co’s announcement a few days before the IPO that it would stop advertising on Facebook has added to the concerns about Facebook’s ability to generate business from advertising. Despite $4.8 billion in expected revenue in 2012, the average amount of money that Facebook makes through each user is still relatively low, said BofA Merrill Lynch, which expects new advertising formats to accelerate revenue growth in the second half of the year. In recent weeks, Facebook has unveiled a string of enhancements to its advertising service, allowing marketers to target ads to users on the mobile version of Facebook and to show Facebook users ads based on previous websites that they have visited. “The company is in the midst of a mobile usage transition and we are cautious on Facebook’s revenue trends until new mobile ad revenue models start driving the top line,” the analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch wrote. Several analysts working for the underwriters, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, cut financial forecasts for Facebook days before the IPO, after the company cautioned about revenue growth due to a rapid shift of users to mobile devices, where Facebook is less effective at generating revenue. The analysts briefed some institutional clients about their revised forecasts, sources have previously told Reuters, but retail investors were left in the dark. That revelation has resulted in lawsuits alleging the banks and Facebook failed to fully disclose the company’s weakened financial outlook ahead of its IPO. "

2012-05-11,0,"Analysts say the company, which is seeking to raise about $10.6 billion by selling more than 337 million shares at $28 to $35 apiece, may raise that price range if demand turns out to be healthy enough. One large institutional investor had put in a major order for shares on Wednesday and was calling around syndicate desks trying to acquire more, a second source familiar with the IPO’s progress told Reuters, declining to be identified because the details are not public. The company that began as Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room project is expected to begin trading on May 18 after an IPO that dwarfs the coming-out parties of other tech powerhouses. But longer term, analysts say Facebook needs to develop a way to earn money from the increasing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones. Facebook, which makes most of its money from advertising, began offering limited ads on the mobile version of its service only recently. "

Among the features of Instagram video, which works with Apple’s iOS and Google Android operating system, are a video stabilization technology and spate of custom design filters. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012 as a way to keep its users hooked on new features weeks before the social media network became a publicly traded company. Instagram is part of Facebook’s mobile strategy as it seeks to get more advertising revenue. More than 60 million people in the United States regularly watched video on their phones last year, according to research firm eMarketer. Almost 75 million are expected to do so this year. "
2012-05-18,2,"The debut -- marred by technical hiccups and the lack of the first-day bounce in the share price that many had expected --  marks the formal ascension of the No. 1 social network to the ranks of Silicon Valley technology powerhouses. Here are a few comments from movers and shakers in Silicon Valley: DAN ROSENSWEIG, CEO OF TEXTBOOK-RENTALS SITE CHEGG, WHO TRIED TO BUY FACEBOOK FOR $1 BILLION WHEN HE WAS COO OF YAHOO: ”I don’t think anybody would have imagined all of this. Except maybe Mark. If you take away the valuation, those conversations with Mark were very deep about the definition of a platform. ”He just kept talking about a platform before the platform was cool. And I‘m not even sure he knew what it meant. ”But he had a vision for connecting people of all kinds. There were only four million people on the platform and they were all college kids, and if you think back then, you could only connect to people at your own college. You couldn’t even connect to friends at a different college. “He had very big ambitions then and it’s pretty clear that he was well ahead of everybody and I think still is.” ”Literally everything you see on the Internet, in a parallel you could see inside Facebook. But done with much more of the ‘social graph’ built into it. So the experiences are going to be more personal, more tailored to you. “Facebook is like a realtor. So they own the platform, they’re going to collect lease, they’re going to collect advertising, they’re going to be in the transaction flow with credits. In a way they operate the mall, and everybody in the  mall will pay some way or another to Facebook.” ”After Google went public, there was a whole series of companies that were built on the search model, that were living in the search ecosystem that Google was building. “I really see it as a whole set of companies that will come up inside Facebook. There’s an equivalent of LinkedIn inside Facebook. There’s an equivalent of EA inside of Facebook. There will be a robust set of companies that are going to create shopping experiences, local experiences. They’re all going to be candidates for future IPOs.” DAVID SZE, PARTNER, GREYLOCK PARTNERS AND EARLY FACEBOOK BACKER ”Every great company is faced with challenges along the way. ”Early on, there was a belief that they never would be able to ever have any advertising revenue, that no one would ever pay for this, that social networking ads would never be real and that that would never work. ”We may see in mobile different emergent kinds of opportunities for monetization. What I love is they’re right in the right place at the right time, and they’re staying hungry. And they’re finding the ways that that’s going to be monetized in the future. “Facebook is seeing 40 percent of the Internet spending 20 minutes a day there. That’s a lot. That’s a lot of engagement. That’s a lot of places where someone is going to be when they’re thinking about buying a car. And if GM doesn’t want to be there, we’ve seen by the tweets Ford wants to be there.” On the shares’ modest debut: ”It looks like the bankers did a good job and the company did a good job of communicating its business and priced it well. “I think it’s a huge distraction for companies when there’s giant pops at the beginning. It just creates more headaches to staying focused and doing what matters, which is building the business. And in truth the big pops are really about speculators and you don’t build businesses around speculators.” ”This is exactly what the underwriters are supposed to do. However, if the company is trading near $40 with assistance then the implied valuation is lower. “They started out with a fairly aggressive price range, then jacked it up and threw a lot more shares into the hopper. You either juice the number of shares or the price, you don’t usually do both.” "
2012-01-26,-24,"Adscend profits from the scam by collecting money from its advertising clients for every Facebook user unwittingly misdirected to a target ad or subscription service, the plaintiffs said. Two separate but similar claims filed in federal court by the state and Facebook accuse Adscend of violating federal and state statutes outlawing misleading or deceptive commercial electronic communications and unfair business practices. The legal action is believed to mark the first time any state government has gone to court in a crackdown against spam spread by Facebook, the world’s most widely used social media network, said Paula Selis, senior counsel for the attorney general. She said schemes such as clickjacking have grown steadily more pervasive, and that millions of Facebook users have probably been exposed to Adscend’s spam. “Security is an arms race,” Ted Ullyot, Facebook’s general counsel, told a news conference at the California-based company’s Seattle office to announce the lawsuits. “It’s important to stay a step ahead against spammers and scammers.” Attorney General Rob McKenna, a Republican running for governor, said Washington state was taking action because “we’ve brought other cases like this and, more than any other state, we’ve developed technological and legal expertise” in the field of cyber fraud. Representatives of Adscend or two co-owners also named as defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. Facebook pages designed as “bait” are disseminated to social network users as posts that seemingly originate from friends, offering visitors an opportunity to view salacious or provocative content. However, that viewing is contingent on completing a series of steps that will supposedly unlock the content but are actually designed to lure Facebook users onto other sites, where they are tricked into giving away personal information or signing up for expensive mobile subscription services. First the victims are encouraged to click the “Like” button on the Facebook “bait” page, which then alerts their friends to the page’s existence, thus helping propagate it. Then they are told they cannot reach the content without filling out a form for an online survey or advertising offer. In one example cited, the “Like” button is overlayed with a link labeled: “This man took a picture of his face every day for 8 years!” The promised content often does not exist, and the user instead is directed through a series of prompts taking them off Facebook and to a string of ads and subscription offers. In some cases, a hidden code embedded in an enticing link on the “bait” page activates the “Like” button without the user even clicking it, sending it to friends’ news feeds. Selis said it may seem unlikely that anyone would click on such links, “but unfortunately they do.” While the number of Facebook users actually scammed by clickjacking is not known, Selis said investigators have determined that some 280,000 users visited the locked content pages of Adscend during February 2011 alone. “So we know there are probably millions of Facebook users” exposed to the deception, she said. Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said the Adscend action was the latest in “our pursuit and support for civil and criminal consequences for spammers or others who attempt to harm Facebook or the people who use our service.” He cited three federal court judgments worth several hundred million dollars each obtained by Facebook against spammers since 2008.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into the matter, and at least one lawsuit has been filed accusing Nasdaq of negligence. Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld barely mentioned Facebook in his remarks at the meeting at the company headquarters in Times Square. “While clearly we had mistakes in the Facebook listing, we still want to highlight the fact that it was the largest IPO ever and on Friday of last week, we processed over 570 million shares,” he said. Nasdaq vies with NYSE Euronext’s New York Stock Exchange for new listings, and some industry players have said the Facebook fiasco could make it more challenging to win big names.

The Menlo Park, California-based company’s shares had closed Wednesday down 87 cents at $49.38, about 30 percent above their $38 initial offering price in May 2012, and giving it a roughly $121 billion market value, Reuters data show. S&P said on December 20 it will also add marketing solutions company Alliance Data Systems Inc and floor covering company Mohawk Industries Inc to the S&P 500, and remove Abercrombie & Fitch Co, JDS Uniphase Corp and Teradyne Inc.

By then, Facebook will have learned more about how to turn its ads into transactions, leading to growth in the advertising rate it charges, Barron’s said.  One concern, however, is Facebook’s appeal to the young, as those under 25 years are spending a lower amount of total mobile time on Facebook compared to other age groups.  Still, Barron’s said that the company could hit $153 a share in a year, which would be a premium price, but not an outlandish one given that investors are paying dearly for rare things like growth, yield and predictability, the report said.

Shares often rise after a company is tapped for inclusion in the S&P 500, because many investors track the index and buy shares of companies that enter it. The Menlo Park, California-based company’s shares had closed Wednesday down 87 cents at $49.38, about 30 percent above their $38 initial offering price in May 2012, and giving it a roughly $121 billion market value, Reuters data show. S&P said on Dec. 20 it will also add marketing solutions company Alliance Data Systems Inc and floor covering company Mohawk Industries Inc to the S&P 500, and remove Abercrombie & Fitch Co, JDS Uniphase Corp and Teradyne Inc. Facebook will also replace Williams Cos  in the S&P 100 index of large U.S. companies. Williams will remain in the S&P 500.   (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

2016-03-02,-19,"Facebook, the world’s biggest social network with 1.6 billion monthly users, earns revenues from advertising based on data it gathers about its users’ social connections, opinions and activities in their postings. “For advertising-financed Internet services such as Facebook, user data are hugely important,” Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt said.  “For this reason it is essential to also examine under the aspect of abuse of market power whether the consumers are sufficiently informed about the type and extent of data collected.” A Facebook spokeswoman said on Wednesday: “We are confident that we comply with the law and we look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions.” The company has faced criticism from politicians and regulators in Germany, where data protection is strictly regulated, over its privacy practices and its slow response to anti-immigrant postings by neo-Nazi sympathizers.   Co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg visited Berlin on a charm offensive last week.  “We welcome the approach of the Cartel office,” Hamburg Data Protection Commissioner Johannes Caspar told Reuters. “Whoever has power over user data gets market power and vice versa.” EU officials have also expressed support for the view that Facebook’s use of data might expose it to regulatory action on competition grounds.  The cartel office said it was coordinating its probe with the European Commission, competition authorities in other European Union states, data protection authorities in Germany and consumer rights groups. French and Irish competition regulators said they were not actively involved with the German case. A spokesman for the Belgian competition authority declined to comment on whether it was cooperating with the German probe, while the British regulator was not immediately reachable. “This is an unusual case in many respects,” said Mark Watts, head of data protection at London-based law firm Bristows. Facebook owns four of the top eight social network services globally including its core profile service, two separate instant messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and its photo and video-sharing social network service Instagram. Facebook has nearly the twice the number of users as the world’s second largest social network, Tencent’s (0700.HK) QQ of China. Nearly 84 percent of the members of Facebook’s core social network are outside the United States and Canada, which generated half its nearly $18 billion in revenues last year. Companies can theoretically face a fine of up to 10 percent of their annual turnover by the German competition regulator if they are found to have abused a dominant market position. But the cartel office has never leveled a maximum penalty.  “User data is often the currency which consumers pay for supposedly free services,” said Klaus Mueller, chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organizations. “Consumers have no adequate alternative. They can’t just transfer their user data to other portals.” The cartel office had already signaled last month it was ready to consider data protection issues as raising potential competition concerns. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the EU executive shared the view of the German cartel office that the mere infringement of data protection rules by a dominant company did not automatically amount to a competition violation. “However, it cannot be excluded that a behavior that violates data protection rules could also be relevant when investigating a possible violation of EU competition rules,” he added, while declining specific comment on the new case. Speaking in Germany in January, top EU antitrust enforcer Margrethe Vestager said her agency was taking a harder look at whether the collection of vast amounts of consumer data by big Internet companies violates competition rules. By contrast, U.S. privacy law enforcement remains limited to gross privacy violations where it can be show companies failed to properly safeguard customer information. The EU has accused Facebook rival Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), of favoring its own shopping services in search results at the expense of rivals, and is weighing possible sanctions against the world’s most popular search engine. However, the commission previously considered and rejected big data issues when it approved Google’s acquisition of online advertising firm DoubleClick in 2008 and Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp in 2014.

2012-05-11,-8,"The company may raise up to $10.6 billion, an amount that would beat the debuts of tech giant Google Inc while giving it a total stock market value that exceeds Amazon.com. Facebook has indicated an initial public offering (IPO) per-share range of $28 to $35, pegging the potential value of the company at $77 billion to $96 billion. But when an IPO scores big on its first day, data shows that’s not a leading indicator as to how it performs in the future. “With the exception of IPOs from 1999-2000, there is no reliable relation between first-day returns and the subsequent three-year return,” says Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who has been studying IPO results and updates a database on their performance. Even if Facebook soars immediately to a market cap of $150 billion or more, there are warning signs ahead, says Ritter: “further upside potential is severely limited.” And if Facebook grows significantly over time, like Apple? Just based on the historical record of IPOs, there are no guarantees. Looking at three-year buy-and-hold periods, and comparing them to the larger market, IPO investors made a meager market-adjusted total return of 2 percent from 2001-2010, reports Ritter. Going back even further, the buy-and-holders did much worse with IPOs when compared to the larger market, as measured by the S&P 500 index including dividends and capital gains. They lost almost 32 percent from 1999-2000; dropped 34 percent from 1995-1998; and declined almost 23 percent from 1980-1989. Remember, these were the golden-fleece days of IPOs, which peaked at 675 offerings in 1996. All told, IPO holders lost about 20 percent in market-adjusted returns from 1980 through 2010, Ritter found. That then brings us into the realm of behavioral economics, an emerging science that examines how irrational and overconfident we can be. We all love a good story - especially about the stocks that we buy. That hard-wired predilection, though, may prevent us from analyzing past history and accepting the reality that many tech stocks are duds down the road (Pets.com ring a bell?). I asked Prof. Daniel Kahneman, Nobel laureate in economics and author of the classic “Thinking Fast and Slow” about how investors should regard a new stock like Facebook. While he declined to predict how the company will fare, he suggested looking at the histories of previous stock offerings and their competitors. In his research, Prof. Kahneman, one of the godfathers of behavioral economics, has discovered that not only do investors tend to be overconfident about their investment choices, they make decisions too quickly based on intuition, which is often wrong. We may fixate upon a number - such as a stock price - and “anchor” it in our minds as something that’s obtainable, even though it may be unrealistic. Then we may fool ourselves into thinking that we can predict how well a stock or the general market may do. On top of that, most of us are born optimists. “People don’t know the boundaries of their expertise,” Kahneman said. “We live in a subjective world and can’t separate what we can forecast from what we can‘t.” To make our decision making even more complicated, a part of our brains Kahneman calls “System One” creates a “coherent” view of an event that suppresses any ambiguities or other interpretations. In the case of Facebook, the story of a Harvard undergrad creating a tech colossus has a satisfactory sweetness to it. There’s no question that Facebook is one of the most-anticipated public offerings in recent memory. With 900 million signed up to the service and growing - I‘m an avid user - it’s undeniably one of the most powerful and addictive forms of social media on the planet. Founder Mark Zuckerberg may be our era’s Alexander Graham Bell. But what about the competition? Can the company sustain its growth and gain advertising? Skepticism often gets sidetracked when System One is ruling. Ultimately, though, despite their magical powers, tech stocks are subject to the laws of supply and demand, earnings, competition and ever-fickle market sentiment. If we can look ourselves in the mirror and admit that, then having honest face time with a Facebook purchase may erase some future worry lines. "

Guests arrived believing they were attending a graduation party for Chan, who graduated from medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, on May 14. Upon arriving, they learned they were actually attending a wedding, the spokesperson said. The guests, limited to the couple’s family and close friends, ate a meal catered by Palo Alto restaurants Palo Alto Sole and Fuki Sushi. They capped off the meal with sweets the couple had eaten on their first date: Burdick chocolate mice. Zuckerberg gave his bride a simple ruby ring he had designed himself, the spokesman said. He ditched his traditional sweatshirt “hoodie” for a jacket and tie, while Chan wore a lace-topped sleeveless dress and a veil over swept-back hair. Chan and Zuckerberg started planning the event four to five months ago, the spokesman said. The couple met as undergraduates at Harvard in 2004.

Winsie had argued for weeks with the girl, and they had swapped insults on the social networking site. “The defendants are guilty of a particularly serious criminal offence. The fact that a friendship between two young girls can turn into deep hate and ultimately into murder being incited is shocking and hard to comprehend,” a court in the city of Arnhem said in a statement.

2016-06-29,-4,"During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their state’s voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government.  “Generally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election,” said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study. Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its “Trending Topics” module. At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a “new town hall” for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global politics and government outreach director Her team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.   Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a “remain” vote in Britain’s referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.    A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.   A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views.  Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britain’s vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any.  Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media.  “To not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies,” Steinberg wrote. “We’re getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other.”  Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

Dutch media reported that the 15-year-old victim, named in court documents as Winsie, had argued for weeks with two friends on the social networking site before they allegedly asked the defendant, who was 14 at the time, to kill her. He was offered a 1,000 euro payment, the media reported. “I am not happy with one year for my daughter’s life,” her father said outside the courthouse. “But that’s what the law book says. We were powerless and so were the authorities.” "
2016-07-02,-7,"But the comments made by Gilad Erdan, a cabinet minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition that oversees law enforcement, were particularly biting. He said Zuckerberg was responsible for Facebook policy and called on “the citizens of Israel to flood him in every possible place with the demand to monitor the platform he established and from which he earns billions”. A spokesman for Facebook in Israel said the company was not commenting on the minister’s assertions. During an interview on Channel 2 television, Erdan said, “Facebook today, which brought an amazing, positive revolution to the world, sadly, we see this since the rise of Daesh (Islamic State) and the wave of terror, it has simply become a monster.” “Facebook today sabotages, it should be known, sabotages the work of the Israeli police, because when the Israeli police approach them, and it is regarding a resident of Judea and Samaria, Facebook does not cooperate,” he said, referring to the area of the West Bank. “It also sets a very high bar for removing inciteful content and posts,” Erdan said. Since October, Palestinians have killed 34 Israelis and two visiting U.S. citizens in a wave of street attacks, mostly stabbings. Israeli forces have shot dead at least 201 Palestinians, 137 of whom Israel has said were assailants. Others were killed in clashes and protests. Palestinian leaders say assailants have acted out of desperation over the collapse of peace talks in 2014 and Israeli settlement expansion in occupied territory that Palestinians seek for an independent state. Most countries view the settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this. Israel says incitement in the Palestinian media and personal problems at home have been important factors that have spurred assailants, often teenagers, to launch attacks. Tensions over Jewish access to a contested Jerusalem holy site, revered by Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and Jews as Temple Mount, have also fueled the violence. "

The two men had posted depictions of the prophet naked on the social networking site, the justice ministry said, inflaming sensitivities in a country where Muslim values have taken on a bigger role since a revolution last year. “They were sentenced ... to seven years in prison for violation of morality, and disturbing public order,” said Chokri Nefti, a justice ministry spokesman. One of the two, Jabeur Mejri is in jail while the second, Ghazi Beji, is still being sought by police and was sentenced in absentia. The sentence was handed down on March 28 but was not reported until Thursday, when bloggers started posting information about the case on the Internet. “The sentences are very heavy and severe, even if these young people were at fault,” one Tunisian blogger, Nebil Zagdoud, told Reuters. “This decision is aimed at silencing freedom of expression even on the Internet. Prosecutions for offending morals are a proxy for this government to gag everyone.” Tunisia electrified the Arab world in January last year when protests forced its autocratic president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, to flee the country.

The revolution also brought tension between conservative Muslims who believe their faith should have a bigger role in public life, and secularists who say freedom of expression and women‘s’ rights are now under attack.

But Facebook and Twitter’s real sin was an act of omission: they failed to contribute to the data that democracy needs to thrive. While sitting on huge troves of information about public opinion and voter intent, social media firms watched as U.S. and UK pollsters, journalists, politicians and civil society groups made bad projections and poor decisions with the wrong information. The data these companies collect, for example, could have told us in real-time whether fake news was having an impact on voters. Information garnered from social media platforms could have boosted voter turnout as citizens realized the race was closer than the polls showed - and that their votes really would matter. Instead, these companies let the United States and UK tumble into a democratic deficit, with political institutions starved of quality data on public opinion. Legally, social media companies aren’t obligated to share data in the public interest. And what they can share is always shaped by users’ privacy settings, country-specific rules about selling personal information, and the particular deals companies like Facebook and Twitter make with third party businesses. But they are now the primary platforms for political conversation. As such, they should act in ways that support democratic practices, especially around sensitive political moments like elections. Facebook and Twitter have the ability to reach, and target, millions of voters. From the minute you sign up on one of these platforms, the companies use data about your behavior, interests, family and friends to recommend news and new social connections. And they sell this data to other companies for even deeper analysis on what you might buy and what you think about important social issues. By examining data about the connections you make and content you share, social media companies can make powerful inferences about whether you are likely to vote, how you are likely to vote, and what kinds of news or advertisements might encourage or discourage you to engage as a citizen. Social media firms regularly study the news consumption habits of users, producing fine-grained analysis of the causes and consequences of political polarization on its platform. To that end, only Facebook and Twitter know how pervasive fabricated news stories and misinformation campaigns have become during referendums and elections. They know who clicked on what links, how much time each user spent reading an “article,” and where the user was physically located. If the companies merged user data with other datasets - say, from credit card records or voter registration files - they may even know the user’s voting history and which political groups the user has donated to. These companies know enough about voter attitudes to serve up liberal news to liberals and conservative news to conservatives, or fake news to undecided voters. During the recent U.S. presidential election, there was a worrying amount of false information on both Facebook and Twitter, and research suggests that many users can’t distinguish between real and fabricated news. My own research on this “computational propaganda” shows that Facebook and Twitter can be easily used to poison political conversations. Trump campaigners were particularly good at using bots - basic software programs with communication skills - to propagate lies. Bogus news sites were started just to make money for their founders, but undoubtedly influenced some voters’ view when manipulated images and false reports went viral. Several major U.S. tech companies have since announced steps to reign in fabricated news. In response to criticism about the spread of misinformation on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg described in a post some of the projects the company already has underway, including making it easier for users to report fake news. Facebook has also updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to this type of content. Google has said it is working to prevent websites that spread bogus news from using its advertising platform. But more can be done. While social media use has been on the rise, our systems for measuring public opinion have been breaking down. Telephone- and internet-based surveys are increasingly inaccurate. With so many people on mobile phones, consuming political content that comes to them through friends, family and Facebook, traditional polling companies no longer get a full picture of what the public knows and wants. For modern democracies to work, three kinds of polling systems need to be up and running. First, nationwide exit polls, which identify mistakes in how elections are run, helping to confirm or refute claims of fraud. For several decades exit polling was coordinated by major news outlets, but the coalition broke down in the United States in 2002 and 2005 in the UK. Today, exit polls are run haphazardly, and are more about predicting winners and outcomes than systematically checking the results. Second, democracies need a regular supply of public policy polls so that journalists, public policy makers, civic groups and elected officials can understand public opinion before and after voting day. Third, democracies need “deliberative polls” that put complex policy questions to representative groups of voters who are given time to evaluate the possible solutions. These kinds of polls engage citizens about public policy options through extended conversations with experts and each other. They lead to more informed decision-making. Companies like Facebook and Twitter manage the platforms over which most citizens in advanced democracies now talk about politics, and they could be the critical new platforms for these polling systems. They could never completely replace existing techniques for measuring public opinion. But our existing polling systems are weakening, and social media platforms have an obvious role to play. With the data at their disposal and the platforms they maintain, social media companies could raise standards for civility by refusing to accept ad revenue for placing fake news. They could let others audit and understand the algorithms that determine who sees what on a platform. Just as important, they could be the platforms for doing better opinion, exit and deliberative polling. This year, Facebook and Twitter watched as ways of measuring public opinion collapsed. Allowing fake news and computational propaganda to target specific voters is an act against democratic values. But withholding data about public opinion is the major crime against democracy.

2012-05-10,-4,"It was not immediately clear what specific information the FTC was looking for, the source said. The Commission automatically initiates a review of any acquisition of significant size. The acquisition of the top photo-sharing service on the Internet is a crucial part of Facebook’s strategy to bolster its mobile offerings, at a time when consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet through smarpthones. Facebook had said it hopes to complete the deal -- the largest in Facebook’s history -- in the second quarter, but some observers think that may be an ambitious target, given the size of the deal and Facebook’s status as the world’s No.1 Internet social network with roughly 900 million users. The FTC’s review of the deal comes as Facebook is preparing to raise as much as $12 billion in a record-breaking initial public offering that could occur as soon as next week. Some investors have cited Facebook’s limited advertising revenue from the mobile versions of its service as a potential concern with regards to the company’s long-term growth potential. Facebook and Twitter declined to comment. Google was not immediately available for comment."
2016-08-03,2,"By making sellers more reliant on Facebook, the company hopes that more businesses in emerging markets will eventually decide to become paying advertisers.  “If a business is seeing value from their page, there is a higher opportunity that they could be an advertiser,” said Benji Shomair, product marketing director of Facebook Pages, in an interview.  Facebook, whose stock hit its all-time high last week after reporting sharp growth in ad sales, has about 3 million active advertisers. But there are more than 60 million businesses worldwide using its service that can set up pages for free in an attempt to reach more customers out of Facebook’s 1.7 billion global monthly users. Southeast Asia is Facebook’s fastest-growing region for users, but it still makes far more money off users in the United States and Canada. The company made average revenue of $13.74 per North American user in the second quarter, compared with an average of $1.74 per user in the Asia-Pacific region. The hugely popular Facebook app and website has largely saturated Western markets and is turning to emerging markets for growth, both in users and advertising dollars.  It has launched Free Basics, a free, pared-down version of the internet, in more than 30 countries that have populations without reliable internet connections, and it is building internet-beaming drones to connect people who have never had access to the internet.  Both initiatives are central to Facebook’s global strategy of seeking to reach a large group of potential users who otherwise would not be able to create Facebook accounts.

2017-01-10,-3,"For example, email services such as Gmail and Hotmail will not be able to scan customers’ emails to serve them with targeted advertisements without getting their explicit agreement. Most free online services rely on advertising to fund themselves. Spending on online advertising in 2015 was 36.4 billion euros, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as “Over-The-Top” (OTT) services, and seeks to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly U.S. Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft. It would allow telecoms companies to use customer metadata, such as the duration and location of calls, as well as content to provide additional services and so make more money, although the telecoms lobby group ETNO said they remain more constrained than their tech competitors. The proposal will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers to deliver personalized advertisements. “It’s up to our people to say yes or no,” said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market. Online advertisers say such rules would undermine many websites’ ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. “It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with,” said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the IAB. But the CEO of advertising tech company Appnext, whose revenues come entirely from advertising spending, said the new rules would bring clarity and would not have a significant impact on business models or revenue. “There is no doubt that it is time for the entire ecosystem to become more transparent and fair to all of the stakeholders. Users want easy access to trustworthy sources of information while feeling safe with the data they share,” Elad Natanson said. Companies falling foul of the new law will face fines of up to 4.0 percent of their global turnover, in line with a separate data protection law set to enter into force in 2018. The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law. "
2012-03-13,0,"Eight million brands, from carmakers to rock bands, switched to Facebook’s new Web page format 10 days after the revamped pages were introduced at a splashy launch event in New York last month, according to Facebook. Some businesses say new advertising offerings that take advantage of Facebook’s latest Web page capabilities are helping them reach a broader audience on the 845-million-member social network. “If there’s a specific message we want to drive, we know this guarantees we’ll get in front of them,” said Steve Baer, director of strategy at Code and Theory, a New York digital marketing agency that recently ran a paid promotion for Dr. Pepper using Facebook’s new ads. Facebook’s moves to cozy up to big consumer brands is key to its efforts to boost revenue as the company prepares for an initial public offering that could value the 8-year-old company at up to $100 billion. One of Facebook’s most important challenges is convincing businesses to spend money advertising on its service rather than simply using the social network as a free promotional tool, analysts and industry observers say. Facebook is aiming its new advertising services at well-known brands like Dr. Pepper, which has amassed more than 11 million “fans” of its Facebook page, but which hasn’t done a lot of advertising on the social network, according to Baer. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group paid to try a new type of Facebook ad that ensures that a post on its brand page will be promoted to its fans in multiple places on the social network. The result, said Baer, was that the post reached 83 percent of Dr. Pepper’s Facebook fans over a 28-day period. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was allowed to use the new Facebook ad format before it was officially introduced to other advertisers two weeks ago and the level of user “engagement,” such as users “liking” the post, was 80 percent higher than normal. Investors, competitors and marketers are watching closely to see if Dr. Pepper’s initial experience and enthusiasm for the new ads is matched by the millions of other big brands that have Facebook pages. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011, with 85 percent of the revenue coming from its advertising business. In courting consumer brands and other businesses, Facebook is competing against the larger and more graphically rich “display” ad formats offered by websites such as Yahoo Inc , as well as against the popular Web search ads where Google Inc is the dominant player. Facebook’s revamped brand pages, which are available to businesses at no cost, offer companies more capabilities to create splashy, media-rich pages within Facebook. A chronological timeline on the right side of the page lets businesses create customized pages to showcase past milestones, and a new “offers” capability lets companies place coupons and promotions directly on their page. Companies can offer the coupons on their Facebook page for free, as well as pay for the coupon to be seen by a larger audience on Facebook. Einstein Bros Bagels, a restaurant chain owned by the Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, recently used a combination of Facebook’s paid and free services to distribute a buy-one-get-one-free sandwich coupon and was impressed with the results. “Taking someone who is online and getting them into a restaurant is a real challenge. This does it and at a better rate than other things we’ve done on Facebook did,” said Brian Lambert, director of interactive marketing and loyalty at Einstein Bros. He said that 10 percent of the 32,000 Facebook users who claimed the coupon redeemed it at a restaurant. And unlike coupons distributed in print ads, the Facebook coupons let Einstein Bros know exactly who claimed the coupons online and who redeemed them at a store. But in a sign of the continuing challenges that Facebook is up against as it tries to attract more marketing dollars, Lambert acknowledged that spending on Facebook ads is a “small portion” of the company’s total online ad spending. The bulk of Einstein Bros online ad budget currently goes to Web search ads from Google. “Our strategy for (Facebook) is still evolving,” he said."

2016-05-13,-7,"The company has come under fire after an unnamed former Facebook employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company’s “trending” list of topics that it says spiked in popularity. The accusation sparked an outcry on social media and prompted a U.S. Senate inquiry into Facebook’s practices. Facebook has “found no evidence that this report is true,” Zuckerberg said in a post published on his Facebook page, but added that the company would continue to investigate. “If we find anything against our principles, you have my commitment that we will take additional steps to address it,” Zuckerberg said. The Facebook chief added that he planned to invite “leading conservatives” to share their points of view. The allegations against Facebook prompted the company to reveal more about how it selects and displays news to its users. In a post published on Facebook’s media relations section on Thursday, a senior company official outlined its “Trending Topics” guidelines at length. “Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin, period,” wrote Justin Osofsky, vice president for global operations. Facebook claims it had over 1 billion daily active users, on average, in March.   (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"

2016-05-15,-5,"Facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company’s “trending” list of topics. Zuckerberg said Facebook has “found no evidence that this report is true,” but would continue to investigate. A U.S. Senate committee has also opened an inquiry into Facebook’s practices. Beck, a former Fox News host, took to Facebook early Sunday to say he is going to the meeting in Menlo Park, California, and  “it would be interesting to look him (Zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains.” “While they are a private business and I support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference,” Beck said, “it would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] INDEPENDENTLY CHOSE to hold up Freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle.” On Friday, Facebook outlined its “Trending Topics” guidelines in its media relations section and stated that reviewers are neither allowed nor advised to discriminate against sources.  Facebook, now valued at around $350 billion, has become a bigger source of news for its more than 1 billion daily active users. Sixty-three percent of users, or 41 percent of all U.S. adults, say they get news from the site, according to a study last year by the Pew Research Center and the Knight Foundation.  "
2012-10-08,1,"Facebook said it is working with seven retailers, including Pottery Barn and Victoria’s Secret, to test the new feature that will allow certain users to flag images of desired products by clicking a special “want” button. “People will be able to engage with these collections and share things they are interested in with their friends. People can click through and buy these items off of Facebook,” Facebook said in a statement. The feature, which Facebook has dubbed Collections, could help Facebook play a bigger role in the online commerce market by encouraging its 1 billion users to buy products for their friends and by sending shoppers directly to online stores. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company does not receive a fee when someone purchases a wishlist item on Facebook from a retailer’s site. But Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the new Collections feature could open up new sources of revenue for Facebook, whose stock has taken a drubbing as concerns about its long-term money-making prospects have mounted. “E-commerce is one of the best ways to monetize the Internet,” said Sebastian. “Thinking about how large they are as a platform and how engaged people are, there are lots of levers they haven’t pulled yet in terms of monetization,” he said. In addition to potentially collecting a transaction fee for referring users to an e-commerce site, Sebastian said that retailers might also pay Facebook to promote products featured on users’ wishlists, similar to the way the Facebook’s current ads function. Shares of Facebook, finished Monday’s regular session down 2.4 percent at $20.40. Earlier on Monday, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield downgraded Facebook to a “Sell” rating. In a note to investors, Greenfield cited concerns about the company’s advertising business, particularly Facebook’s nascent efforts to expand the business onto the mobile devices that its users increasingly access the service from. Facebook’s new Collections feature will gradually be offered to 100 percent of its U.S. users, Facebook said. Some users will see the “want” button as part of the test, while others will see a button inviting them to “collect” an item or to “like” an item. Unlike Facebook’s existing “like” button, the feature that Facebook is testing will showcase the “liked” item within a user’s Timeline profile page. Facebook is also testing the Collections feature with Neiman Marcus, Michael Kors, Smith Optics, Wayfair and Fab.com. "
2012-05-15,2,"The company, which began in a Harvard dorm room by Mark Zuckerberg, raised the target range to between $34 and $38 per share in response to strong demand, from $28 to $35, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. That would value Facebook at roughly $93 billion to $104 billion, rivaling the market capitalization of Internet powerhouses such as Amazon.com Inc, and exceeding that of Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc combined. The price increase indicates intense market demand, which means Facebook’s shares are likely to see a big pop on their first day of trading on Nasdaq on Friday, analysts said. “It’s confounding but the evidence is that if companies raise the range they will pop more,” said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based financial services firm IPOX Schuster LLC. “It signals that there is such a strong demand that it will create a momentum for other investors who want to jump on.” In the biggest-ever IPO to emerge from Silicon Valley, Facebook will raise $12.1 billion based on the mid-point price of $36 and the 337.4 million shares on offer, or 12.3 percent of the company. At this mid-point, Facebook would be valued at roughly 27 times its 2011 annual revenue, or 99 times earnings. When Google Inc went public in 2004 at a valuation of $23 billion, it was valued at 16 times trailing revenue and 218 times earnings. Apple, meanwhile, went public in 1980 at a valuation of 25 times revenue and 102 times earnings. Wall Street had expected Facebook to increase its price range, with investors eager to get a slice of a strong consumer brand. The IPO roadshow began last week and has drawn crowds of investors from coast to coast. Facebook plans to close the books on its IPO later on Tuesday, two days ahead of schedule, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters on Monday. It is scheduled to price its shares on Thursday and begin trading on Nasdaq on Friday. The IPO is already “well oversubscribed,” which is why the company will close its books earlier than anticipated, the source said. Facebook’s capital-raising target far outstrips other big Internet IPOs. Google raised just shy of $2 billion in 2004, while last year Groupon Inc tapped investors for $700 million and Zynga Inc raked in $1 billion. The IPO comes amid concerns from some investors that Facebook has not yet figured out a way to make money from an increasing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones. Company executives met with prospective investors in Chicago on Monday and were slated to travel to Kansas City, Missouri, and Denver, before returning to Facebook’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters. A host of Wall Street banks are underwriting Facebook’s offering, with Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs serving as leads. Facebook will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol FB."

In December 2015, Zuckerberg made one of the largest pledges in history when he and his wife said they would donate 99 percent of their company shares to charity. Sandberg's donation will be used to fund LeanIn.Org, her nonprofit focused on women's empowerment, as well as OptionB.org, an initiative focused on helping people build resilience after experiencing loss, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. on.wsj.com/2fNQkV5 Sandberg, 46, who joined Facebook in 2008 as chief operating officer for the popular social media platform, lost her husband to a treadmill accident while they were vacationing in Mexico last year.

2012-05-25,-32,"This is not the first time investors in a hot tech company’s initial public offering have alleged that underwriters favored their regular clients at the expense of the little guys. In the tech bubble of the late 1990s, IPO investors became suspicious of the steep run-up in prices that seemed inevitably to follow a stock’s debut. Eventually, some 309 IPO shareholder class actions were rolled into a giant multidistrict lawsuit called In re: Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation. The plaintiffs said underwriters allocated IPO stakes to institutions on the condition that those investors would create demand by continuing to buy the stock after it started trading. According to the class, the institutional investors would then bail out and give a portion of their profits to investment banks, leaving individual investors stuck with losses when the stock price returned to earth. Eight years of litigation resulted in a $586 million settlement, which was approved in 2009 by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. A growing number of lawsuits are being filed against Facebook. Claims by four of Wall Street’s main market makers against Nasdaq over the botched IPO are likely to exceed $100 million, as they and other traders continue to deal with thousands of problems with customer orders. Attorney Stanley Bernstein of Bernstein Liebhard, who served as the chair of the plaintiffs’ executive committee in the dot-com litigation, said the Facebook IPO is more of the same: “This is just another spin on the same game of unfair treatment of individual investors.” His firm is gathering clients and preparing to file its own Facebook suit, he said. Bernstein addressed the legal issues involved in Facebook’s IPO and the dot-com bust, in an interview with Reuters: Q: What lessons do you think the banks and Facebook should have learned from the IPO securities litigation you headed? A: We litigated 300 IPO cases from the dot.com era, where we uncovered and hopefully caused the correction of a number of evils. Regrettably, the banks and Wall Street have not learned their lesson and have devised and/or utilized loopholes to unfairly tilt the playing field against individual investors and in favor of a select group of institutional investors. It’s an unfair system that still needs to be corrected. In the Facebook case, public reports strongly suggest that (underwriters) crossed the line of impropriety by telling the public that there might be a reduced earnings stream for mobile applications, while telling their favorite customers that there will be a reduced stream .... And the entire process causes any rational-thinking person to reconsider a rule that allows bank analysts to give earnings estimates orally to their favorite customer but not publish them to the investing public. Q: You said it’s a system that needs to be corrected and that banks and companies have devised rules that result in an unfair playing field. Regardless of whether the rules were fair, if (Facebook and the banks) were following them, doesn’t it mean that they can’t be held liable for not disclosing the information? A: No, because published reports make it clear that ... select customers (received) information that was not in the prospectus. The prospectus said revenue “might” (decline), but published reports indicate that ... it was an actuality. That is a clear violation of disclosure rules. Q: In this case, instead of hyping the stock, the analysts actually lowered their expectations so the stock price never really soared, in contrast to the situation in the IPOs in the 1990s that you addressed in the IPO litigation. Does that difference matter? A: The evils that caused the 100- and 200-percent pops on IPOs in the days of the dot.com boom have basically been eliminated as a result of (our) litigation. Now people have “only” lost 10 percent of their investment in a matter of hours. That is a very significant loss and will not be ignored. Q: Do you expect all potential plaintiffs in the Facebook IPO litigation to be part of the same class, or do you expect more casual investors and so-called “sophisticated investors” to seek to proceed in separate suits? A: I think this one will be a much simpler class. Here it’s a very short time period, and the issues are much easier to define than in the complex dot.com litigation. That was 300 different cases and 55 investment banks and 1,000 individual employees. This is a few investment banks, one company and a class period of several days. It’s a classic case for resolution in a class action. "

On Tuesday, Gamesys, an independent gaming company, launched a version of online Bingo for Facebook users in Britain who are at least 18, and which the company said will pay winners real money. Gamesys also announced plans to offer virtual slots gambling on Facebook. Facebook confirmed that it is partnering with Gamesys to allow gambling on its service. “Real money gaming is a popular and well-regulated activity in the UK and we are allowing a partner to offer their games to adult users on the Facebook platform in a safe and controlled manner,” Facebook said in a statement. Facebook spokeswoman Linda Griffin said there are no current plans to offer gambling in any other countries or with any other partners besides Gamesys. She declined to disclose what portion of the revenue Facebook would take from the gambling on the Gamesys games, but acknowledged that there was a revenue sharing agreement between Facebook and Gamesys. Facebook takes a 30 percent share of revenue for transactions on non-gambling games on its service, such as when users purchase virtual tractors and seeds in Zynga Inc’s  popular Farmville game. Facebook, which makes the majority of its money from online advertising, has seen its revenue growth slow sharply during the past year. In the second quarter, Facebook reported revenue growth of 32 percent, down sharply from more than 100 percent growth it delivered at the same time last year. Shares of Facebook were down 3 percent at $21.26 on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq. "

Leland Yee, a California state senator, told Reuters on Friday he introduced legislation that would prohibit companies in the state from soliciting Facebook passwords from job applicants. The Associated Press reported that lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland were also considering similar moves. “Employers can’t ask in the course of an interview your sexual orientation, your age, and yet social media accounts may have that information,” Yee said. “Employers have legitimate questions about a person’s job performance, but they can get that information the regular way, without cutting corners and violating people’s privacy.” Egan said in a post on Facebook’s website published on Friday that the social networking company has seen in recent months ”a distressing increase in reports of employers or others seeking to gain inappropriate access to people’s Facebook profiles. ”We don’t think employers should be asking prospective employees to provide their passwords because we don’t think it’s the right thing to do. “But it also may cause problems for the employers that they are not anticipating. For example, if an employer sees on Facebook that someone is a member of a protected group (e.g. over a certain age, etc.) that employer may open themselves up to claims of discrimination if they don’t hire that person.” In the case of the Maryland Department of Corrections, job applicants were asked to browse through their own Facebook accounts with an interviewer present, the AP reported. The ACLU, which previously criticized the Maryland state government’s online vetting, called the practice “an invasion of privacy” in a statement this week. “You’d be appalled if your employer insisted on opening up your postal mail to see if there was anything of interest inside,” said ACLU attorney Catherine Crump. “It’s equally out of bounds for an employer to go on a fishing expedition through a person’s private social media account.” Facebook’s outspoken stance on the issue cast it in an unfamiliar but welcome role. Hundreds of users cheered Egan, applauding a company that has been repeatedly criticized for bungling privacy issues over the years, especially when changing privacy settings without duly notifying users. By Friday afternoon, close to a thousand users had “Liked” Egan’s post and many users left positive comments. Yet there were still a few cynics. “FB you’re talking out of both sides of your mouth,” wrote  Facebook user Ron Carrubba. “Now how about fixing your other privacy issues in the application itself?”"

However, Facebook at Work users will maintain special profiles that are distinct from their existing Facebook profiles. The company is also developing exclusive products for Facebook at Work, including security tools, Codorniou said. Facebook started beta-testing the service in January and has kept it as a free, “invite-only” service for companies so far. The online career market, which includes LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N and Monster Worldwide Inc MWW.N, is worth about $6 billion a year, market research firm IDC had said in August. More than 300 companies, including Heineken (HEIN.AS), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and jewelry company Stella and Dot, are using Facebook at Work and Club Mediterranee SA is set to be the latest adopter. The French resort company will offer the service to all its 13,000 employees through summer 2016, Anne Browaeys-Level, Club Mediterranee’s chief marketing & digital officer, told Reuters.

2016-05-24,-16,"But the world’s largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes, including elimination of a top-ten list of approved websites, more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias, and more robust review procedures. Earlier this month, a former Facebook contractor had accused the company’s editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor.  The report led Republican Sen. John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list. (bit.ly/1Tvv3Nm) Two days after Thune’s letter, Facebook published a lengthy blogpost detailing how Trending Topics works even though it rarely discloses such practices. Previously, it had never discussed the inner workings of the feature, which displays topics and news articles in the top right hand corner of the desktop homepage for its more than 1.6 billion users. Facebook said its investigation showed that conservative and liberal topics were approved as trending topics at nearly identical rates. It said it was unable to substantiate any allegations of politically motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources. But it did not rule out human error in selecting topics. “Our investigation could not fully exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies,” Colin Stretch, Facebook’s General Counsel, wrote in a company blogpost.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg met last week with more than a dozen conservative politicians and media personalities to discuss issues of trust in the social network. In his letter, Thune had called on Facebook to respond to the criticism and sought answers by May 24 to several questions about its internal practices. “Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open internet,” Thune said.

2012-05-09,-1,"* App Center will handle PC and mobile apps * Social giant trying to capture more mobile cash By Alexei Oreskovic SAN FRANCISCO, May 9 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc  unveiled a new hub for consumers to find games and other apps on the social network, including its first storefront for selling paid apps, in the company’s latest effort to expand the ways its makes money from its massive audience. The new App Center, which Facebook said will launch in the next few weeks, comes as the company is preparing an initial public offering that would value the company between $77 billion and $96 billion. A key concern for investors is Facebook’s slowing revenue growth, due in part to the widening trend of consumers accessing its service on smartphones, where Facebook provides limited ads. In an amended prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Facebook said the popularity of mobile devices has caused its number of daily users to grow faster than the number of ads it is delivering. Facebook described the number of mobile ads it has recently begun showing to users as “immaterial.” Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue from online ads, although it also collects fees when consumers purchase goods from within social apps, such as Zynga’s Farmville. The App Center will, for the first time, allow software developers to sell apps to consumers directly on Facebook. Consumers will need to use Facebook Credits, the company’s payment system, to purchase the apps and Facebook will take a 30 percent cut of the revenue as it does with in-app purchases, said Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich. Facebook is introducing the app service to give software developers additional options, but the company expects in-app purchases to remain more prevalent on the social network, said Lucich. Apps, ranging from social games to music services, are popular activities on Facebook, the world’s No.1 online social network with roughly 900 million users. According to the company, 200 of the apps that are available on Facebook have more than 1 million users. The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple Inc iPhones and Android smartphones. If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple’s App Store or Google Inc’s Play store to download the app. The App Center will showcase apps based on the quality scores that users give apps and other data Facebook collects, such as how often and how long people use apps. Each user will see a different, customized version of the App Center, rather than one standard version of the App Center."
2012-05-07,1,"Zuckerberg showed up at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown Manhattan in jeans and a black fleece sweatshirt shortly before 1 p.m. The world’s largest social network aims to raise about $10.6 billion, dwarfing the coming-out parties of tech companies like Google Inc and granting it a market value close to Amazon.com Inc’s . Investors are expected to flock to the highly anticipated IPO, despite persistent concerns about Facebook’s longer-term growth and Zuckerberg’s majority control. The 8-year-old social network that began as Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room project indicated an IPO range of $28 to $35 a share on Thursday, which would value the company at $77 billion to $96 billion. The size of the IPO reflects the company’s growth and bullish expectations about its money-making potential as a hub for everything from advertising to commerce. Many investors say they expect Facebook to raise its offer price-range as the roadshow progresses from New York to major cities such as Chicago, Boston and San Francisco. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Herman Leung said in a note to investors on Monday that he expected Facebook’s revenue to grow 40 percent this year and 33 percent in 2013. He said the $28 to $35 range for Facebook shares was an “attractive” valuation that provided a “compelling entry point” for investors. In a separate note published Sunday, Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser put a $30 price target on shares of Facebook. “We would not be surprised if the stock trades up above the IPO price on retail interest in the company over the near term,” he wrote."
2013-03-26,-1,"So far, the system has been used to target graphical display ads on the right side of a Facebook user’s page, based on websites visited in the past, such as for products or potential vacation destinations. The move announced on Tuesday will incorporate this system, called Facebook Exchange, to the ads in Facebook’s News Feed. It ties together two of the most significant innovations that Facebook Inc has made in the past year to its advertising business, which accounts for roughly 84 percent of the company’s revenue. Marketers last year welcomed the launch of Facebook Exchange as it provided a common online advertising technique long missing on the social network. Ads that appear directly within the Facebook News Feed are considered crucial to its future business prospects since they can be seen on mobile devices such as smartphones. About two-thirds of Facebook users accessed the site on a mobile device in December. Facebook said the Facebook Exchange system will initially be available for newsfeed ads that appear on desktop PCs but not on mobile devices. “Desktop is more in line with what FBX (Facebook Exchange) has been doing effectively in the right hand side. And we also find that desktop is the place where more people convert from seeing direct-response ads,” said Facebook spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana. The company is testing the new service with a limited set of partners, with plans for broader availability in the coming weeks. Shares of Facebook closed 7 cents higher at $25.21 on Nasdaq. "
2012-05-17,-4,"* Others note boosted price, sheer size By Olivia Oran NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is expected to price its initial public offering to raise more than $16 billion on Thursday, as strong demand, particularly from retail investors, fuels anticipation for a big pop in the stock when it begins trading on the Nasdaq. Predictions on how much the stock will rise on Friday vary greatly, with some experts saying anything short of a 50 percent jump will be disappointing given the hype over what would be the third-largest initial share sale in U.S. history, after Visa Inc  and General Motors Co. Other IPO watchers say the large size of the float, coupled with a raised price range, could curb first-day gains to as little as 10 percent. “I think anything over 50 percent will be considered a successful offering - anything under that would be underwhelming,” said Jim Krapfel, analyst at Morningstar. “A lot of retail investors are not concerned about valuation. That’s what is going to drive the first day pop.” Lee Simmons, industry specialist at Dun & Bradstreet, had a more modest forecast. “You’ve got a large offering at an increased price - so a huge pop may be difficult to achieve. I’d think a 10 to 20 percent pop over the offer price is expected,” Simmons said. “When you’re talking about doubling or a pop the size of LinkedIn, it’s more difficult to achieve because Facebook is just offering more shares ... The others were smaller floats - under 10 percent - so you had this artificial feeding frenzy.” Professional networking company LinkedIn Corp’s  shares doubled on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Another social media company, online games developer Zynga Inc which makes lots of games for Facebook users, fizzled on debut and ended down 5 percent on its first day of trading on Nasdaq. No one Reuters spoke with said they were expecting a fall in Facebook’s stock on Friday. The No. 1 social network, with some 900 million users, on Tuesday raised the target IPO price range to between $34 and $38 per share, from between $28 and $35. That would value Facebook at $93 billion to $104 billion, rivaling the market value of Internet powerhouse Amazon.com Inc , and exceeding that of Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc combined. On Wednesday, Facebook increased the size of the IPO by almost 25 percent to 421 million shares, a 15 percent float. If it prices at the top of the range, as expected, Facebook would raise at least $16 billion - including a greenshoe option for underwriters, it would raise north of $18.4 billion. Despite the high expectations, the social network started eight years ago in Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room does face challenges maintaining its growth momentum. Some investors worry the company has not yet figured out a way to make money from the growing number of users who access Facebook on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Meanwhile, revenue growth from Facebook’s online advertising business, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue, has slowed in recent months. Sports betting firms had varying estimates of where Facebook would end up at the close of its first day of trading. Spreadex Limited in Hertfordshire, UK, said clients are speculating shares could end up trading above $56 a share in the first day, having come down a bit in price since the amount of shares slated for sale were increased. Betting on Intrade, a popular online betting site for political events, was limited, with only about 750 shares changing hands in contracts that bet on a closing price anywhere from $25 to $60. By contrast, more than 200,000 trades have been made on President Barack Obama’s chances for re-election. Some financial advisers have warned their clients against jumping into Facebook right away, but the well-known brand could still attract enough interest to exceed the 458 million shares traded the day General Motors went public after emerging from bankruptcy in 2010. One UBS adviser initially received calls from 12 clients clamoring to buy shares of Facebook, but over the past couple of  weeks, two have changed their minds. “A lot of people are thrown off by the recent negative stories in the press,” the adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “One guy was worried about General Motors stopping its advertising on Facebook.” GM said on Tuesday it would stop placing ads on Facebook, raising questions about whether the display ads on the site are as effective in reaching consumers as traditional media. Overall financial advisers are struggling to manage clients’ expectations about what the stock will do and in some cases, if they will be able to get any stock for them. “People want to just own it because they think it’s the next Google and they missed out on that,” said a financial adviser from Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage division of Wells Fargo & Co, which is part of the syndicate underwriting the deal. Facebook has 33 underwriters for the IPO, led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. "
2016-05-13,-7,"The accusation sparked an outcry on social media and prompted a U.S. Senate inquiry into Facebook’s practices. Facebook has “found no evidence that this report is true,” Zuckerberg said in a statement posted late Thursday on his Facebook page, but added that the company would continue to investigate. “If we find anything against our principles, you have my commitment that we will take additional steps to address it,” Zuckerberg said. The Facebook chief added that he planned to invite “leading conservatives” to share their points of view. The allegations against Facebook prompted the company to reveal more about how it selects and displays news to its users. In a post published on Facebook’s media relations section on Thursday, a senior company official outlined its “Trending Topics” guidelines at length. “Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin, period,” wrote Justin Osofsky, vice president for global operations. Facebook had over 1 billion daily active users, on average, in March, the company posted to its newsroom. "

2013-06-28,-10,"The moves come a month after several businesses pulled their ads from Facebook amid reports of pages on Facebook that promoted violence against women. Facebook said at the time that it needed to improve its system for flagging and removing content that violated its community standards, which forbid users from posting content about hate-speech, threats and pornography, among other things. Ads account for roughly 85 percent of revenue at Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 1.1 billion users. Facebook said the changes would not have a meaningful impact on its business. On Friday, Facebook said it also needed to do more to prevent situations in which ads are displayed alongside material that may not run afoul of its community standards but are deemed controversial nonetheless. A Facebook page for a business that sells adult products, for example, will no longer feature ads. Previously such a page could feature ads along the right-hand side of the page so long as the page did not violate Facebook’s prohibition on depicting nudity. The move underscores the delicate balance for social media companies, which features a variety of unpredictable and sometimes unsavory content shared by users, but which rely on advertising to underpin their business. “Our goal is to both preserve the freedoms of sharing on Facebook but also protect people and brands from certain types of content,” Facebook said in a post on its website on Friday. Facebook said on Friday that it would expand the scope of pages and groups on its website that should be ad-restricted and promised to remove ads from the flagged areas of the website by the end of the coming week. Pages and groups that reference violence will also be off limits to ads, the company said. A Facebook spokeswoman noted that the policy would not apply to the pages of news organizations on Facebook. Facebook said the process of flagging objectionable pages and removing ads would initially be done manually, but that the company will build an automated system to do the  job in the coming weeks."

MichaelAaron Flicker, president of XenoPsi, a New York City-based marketing firm, said the new product is Facebook’s attempt at capturing “in the moment” engagement. “They don’t have that piece of the puzzle,” Flicker said. “The challenge for Facebook is there are already a lot of communities (like Facebook Sports Stadium). This is not a unique offering.” Facebook Sports Stadium currently covers only American football games and comes ahead of next month’s Super Bowl, on Feb. 7. But it will support other sports, including basketball and soccer, in the future, Facebook said. The service can be accessed by searching for an individual game. "
2014-12-12,-1,"The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson, comes as Facebook has revamped its own search offerings, introducing a tool on Monday that allows users to quickly find past comments and other information posted by their friends on Facebook. The decision may reflect the increasing importance that Facebook sees in Web search technology, a market dominated by rival Google Inc. Searches on Facebook have long been geared towards helping users connect with friends and to find other information that exists within the walls of the 1.35 billion-user social networking service. But for years, Facebook’s search results also included links to standalone websites that were provided by Bing. “We’re not currently showing web search results in Facebook Search because we’re focused on helping people find what’s been shared with them on Facebook,” a company spokesperson told Reuters. “We continue to have a great partnership with Microsoft in lots of different areas.” Microsoft was not immediately available for comment. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has flagged search as one of the company’s key growth initiatives, noting in July that there were more than 1 billion search queries occurring on Facebook every day and hinting that the vast amount of information that users share within Facebook could eventually replace the need to search the Web for answers to certain questions. “There is more than a trillion posts, which some of the search engineers on the team like to remind me, is bigger than any Web search corpus out there,” Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts in July. Microsoft’s Bing is the No.2 Web search provider in the U.S., with a nearly 20 percent share of the market according to industry research firm comScore. Facebook and Microsoft have a longstanding relationship dating back to Microsoft’s $240 million investment in Facebook, for a 1.6 percent stake in the company, in October 2007. As part of that deal, Microsoft provided banner ads on Facebook’s website in international markets. Facebook stopped using Microsoft banner ads in 2010 as it moved to take more control of its advertising business. But Facebook, during that same time, expanded its use of Microsoft Bing search results to international versions of its service.   (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Christian Plumb)"

2013-10-01,2,"Facebook’s so-called mobile app ads - which allow companies to promote their mobile apps to Facebook’s 1.15 billion users - will include new capabilities designed to boost the amount of time that consumers use the third-party apps, the company said on Tuesday. Since the start of the year, more than 145 million third-party apps have been installed by Facebook users, said Deb Liu, Facebook’s director of platform monetization, providing the company’s first public data about that portion of its business. Roughly 8,400 advertisers used Facebook’s mobile app ads in the second quarter, Liu said. That is a small group relative to the more than 1 million total advertisers that Facebook counts, but analysts say that app developers represent an attractive and growing group of customers for Facebook to tap into.  Smartphone apps, designed for Apple Inc’s iPhone or Google Inc’s  Android-based phones, have struggled to stand out in a crowded field. Facebook’s new mobile app ads will allow the maker of a travel app to offer to promote an airfare or hotel room, for example, while a music app like Spotify could promote a band’s new song. Previously, Facebook’s mobile app ads were designed only to entice its users to install a third-party app on their smartphone or tablet, but not to encourage repeat visits to the app. Shares of Facebook have doubled since July, as the company has increased its mobile advertising revenue. use"

2012-06-19,-22,"The company said it employs “hundreds” of staffers in several offices around the world to handle the millions of user reports it receives every week about everything from spam to threats of violence. A detailed, and somewhat confusing, chart published by Facebook on its website on Tuesday depicts how reports of various infractions are routed through the company and lays out all the potential outcomes, which can range from an account being disabled to Facebook alerting law enforcement. Facebook spokesman Fred Wolens said the company decided to publish the chart to provide more “transparency” about how user reports are dealt with. “There was a feeling that once users clicked ‘report,’ it was not immediately clear what happens,” Wolens said. The user reports are one way that Facebook maintains order on its service, where U.S. users spend more than six hours per month sharing videos and photos, playing video games and listening to music, according to research firm comScore. Facebook, which last month had one of the largest initial public offerings in U.S. history but whose stock has since fallen below its offering price, competes with Google Inc , Yahoo Inc and other Web companies as a top online destination. ‘CORE VALUE PROPOSITION’ Specialized technology and teams of Facebook staffers actively monitor the website to detect and remove content that violates its policies, such as hate speech, bullying and harassment and pornography. Facebook’s “core value proposition is that the Web is kind of a messy and dangerous place, unlike Facebook which is a safer place for you and your friends,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with research firm Gartner. In a posting accompanying the chart on Tuesday, Facebook explained that its User Operations group comprises four teams to handle the different types of incident reports: a safety team, a hate and harassment team, an access team and an abusive content team. A user report about a threat of vandalism for instance would be handled by Facebook’s safety team, which would have the option of referring the matter to law enforcement, warning the user, or disabling the user’s account. Facebook’s Wolens said the company does not disclose how often it refers incidents to law enforcement authorities. A user can also appeal a decision disabling their account to a separate group at Facebook. But even Facebook’s defenses sometimes fail, as in November when numerous users reported seeing a flood of explicitly violent images in their newsfeeds. Facebook blamed the incident on a “coordinated spam attack that exploited a browser vulnerability” according to media reports at the time."
2013-09-19,5,"The service, which Facebook quietly rolled out in the United States during the past year, analyzes its users’ mobile phones and wireless providers to see who has switched handsets or carriers after looking at an ad. Facebook, which says users’ personal data are hidden from advertisers, will begin offering the service to telecom industry advertisers in nine other countries this week, with a target of 25 countries by year’s end. With 1.15 billion members, Facebook has stepped up efforts over the past year to forge stronger ties with advertisers across different industries and put to rest any skepticism about the payoff that ads on its social network can deliver. In October, Facebook partnered with Datalogix, a data mining firm, to help show marketers of consumer packaged goods how their Facebook campaigns led to in-store retail sales. Telecom is the third largest category of digital brand advertising in the United States, behind retail and consumer packaged goods, according to industry research firm eMarketer. Facebook’s mobile apps automatically detect a user’s phone model and wireless provider to optimize its online service for them. That data also provides valuable insights. “We have the ability to understand how the ads actually influenced the device that somebody had, and all that data sits within Facebook,” said Brad Smallwood, who oversees Facebook’s measurements and insights group. Facebook said three out of the four top U.S. wireless carriers are using the ad measurement service, including AT&T Mobility. Shares of Facebook have climbed more than 70 percent in recent months as the company’s revenue growth has accelerated, thanks in large part to the popularity of new mobile ads that appear in users’ newsfeeds. Mobile ads for telecom industry marketers are seven times more effective than the ads Facebook displays on personal computers, the company said. Services and studies that demonstrate a marketer’s return on investment reflect the “maturing” of Facebook’s advertising sales operations, said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. “Having more analyses and case studies is helpful in the sales process,” he said. “The average advertiser wants to spend money on Facebook; they just have to justify it.” A recent survey by industry magazine Advertising Age and RBC Capital Markets found that 43 percent of respondents believed their return on investment from Facebook ads had “dramatically” or “somewhat” improved over the last six months."

A card can hold multiple gift balances, each dedicated to a specific retailer, Facebook said. The world’s No. 1 social network, with more than one billion users, Facebook is gradually offering more retail services, though it relies on advertising for the bulk of its revenue. Last year, it launched a feature that allows users to send retail goods, such as sunglasses and pastries, to their friends on the social network. Facebook Finance Chief David Ebersman tempered expectations about the new gifts business in its quarterly earnings conference call with analysts on Wednesday. While Facebook believes online commerce has “long-term potential,” the current revenue from such efforts is very small and will remain so throughout the year, said Ebersman. Shares of Facebook fell 13 cents at $31.10 in mid-day trading."
2012-02-13,-8,"The criticism of Facebook’s corporate governance comes in the wake of the social networking company’s registration papers for its initial public offering on Feb 1. The California State Teachers’ Retirement system, the second-largest U.S. pension fund, has called on Facebook to expand its board of directors to include women. Corporate governance structures such as Facebook -- similar to Zynga or LinkedIn -- will limit the rights of shareholders and cause problems if the company ever decides to change its structure, ISS said in a four-page report titled the “Tragedy of the Dual Class Commons.” Founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will control about 57 percent of the company’s voting shares after the IPO. Facebook also set up a series of defenses against proxy battles and unwanted takeover attempts, according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “This is a governance profile with a defense against everything expect hubris,” the report said. The group argued that establishing a dual-class structure early on, in which Zuckerberg owns shares with 10 votes each, divides “ownership interests into potentially opposing groups,” that could result in proxy fights down the line. A Facebook spokesman did not respond immediately for a comment on Monday."
2012-03-26,-13,"Paul Ceglia, who has lived in Wellsville, New York, sued Zuckerberg and Facebook - now one of the world’s most valuable companies - in 2010 in a dispute over a 2003 contract. Facebook has repeatedly said Ceglia was a fraud and that a “Work for Hire Document” was a forgery and emails he purportedly exchanged with Zuckerberg were made up. Last year, the presiding judge in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York, gave Facebook more time to gather evidence. “The evidence is in. And it is devastating for Ceglia and his cohorts,” Facebook’s lawyers wrote in a motion to dismiss filed on Monday. “Ceglia and his co-conspirators have compounded their wrongdoing by destroying and tampering with evidence, obstructing discovery, and defying court orders.” They said they had found emails, dating back to Zuckerberg’s days at Harvard University, to prove Ceglia’s fraud. They asked the judge to halt Ceglia’s lawsuit, which they said was filed “in hopes of extorting a settlement through their fraudulent scheme.” A lawyer for Ceglia could not immediately be reached to comment. Ceglia said he hired Zuckerberg when he was a Harvard University freshman for multiple projects, one of which eventually became Facebook. Founded by Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room and now based in Menlo Park, California, Facebook is the world’s No. 1 online social network with more than 845 million users. In February, Facebook filed with securities regulators to raise $5 billion in an initial public offering. Zuckerberg controls 28.4 percent of Facebook’s Class B shares, a filing shows. Facebook may be worth $93.6 billion, according to SharesPost Inc, which tracks valuations of private companies. The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of New York, No. 10-00569."
2014-04-09,2,"Facebook began notifying users in France, England and several other European countries on Wednesday that beginning in a couple of weeks they will need to install the company’s standalone Messenger app in order to send and receive messages. Facebook plans to eventually require that users in all countries install the Messenger app, spokesman Derick Mains said, though he could not provide a specific timeframe for the change. The move is intended to ensure that users have a consistent and high-quality experience, a Facebook spokesman told Reuters. The free, standalone Messenger app is faster than the messaging service that’s currently built into Facebook’s primary mobile app. Facebook users can also access more features in the Messenger app, such as the ability to make voice phone calls. “We have built a fast and reliable messaging experience through Messenger and now it makes sense for us to focus all our energy and resources on that experience,” the company said in a statement. Facebook faces increasing competition from a new crop of fast-growing mobile messaging apps, such as Snapchat and Line. It stunned observers by announcing plans in February to buy the popular WhatsApp messaging app for $19 billion. Forcing users to install a separate messaging app on their phones could help boost the popularity of Facebook Messenger, but could also cause a backlash if consumers view Facebook’s move as heavy-handed. A post on the technology blog Mashable on Wednesday was titled “11 Reasons why Pulling Messenger From Facebook Mobile is a Terrible Idea,” and many people took to Twitter to post critical comments about the change. Facebook, the world’s No.1 social networking service with 1.2 billion users, has increasingly moved to develop a catalog of standalone apps to complement its main app. In January, Facebook launched Paper, a photo-heavy news-reading app that has earned positive reviews. Facebook also acquired photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and announced plans to buy WhatsApp, which has more than 450 million users. News of the change in Facebook’s messaging service was first reported by the technology blog TechCrunch on Wednesday.    (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Bernard Orr)"
2016-04-28,1,"Facebook’s shares, which touched a record high of $120.79 on Thursday, closed up 7.2 percent at $116.73, giving a $22 billion boost to the social networking company’s market value. “FB remains in a class by itself across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability,” J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Doug Anmuth said in a research note. “While there are broader concerns of macro softness toward the end of 1Q, Facebook isn’t seeing them.” Apple lost about $36 billion in market value on Wednesday after it reported disappointing earnings the previous day, while Alphabet shed nearly $30 billion after missing expectations. Analysts don’t see Facebook’s growth slowing anytime soon as it grabs a bigger share of the advertising market, particularly on mobile devices. At least 26 brokerages raised their price targets on Facebook’s stock, with RBC the most bullish at $165. The median price target is $145, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Facebook continues to generate very high and very profitable growth. An extremely rare combination. And we see in FB plenty of strong, secular platform growth ahead,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients. Facebook’s ad revenue jumped 57 percent to $5.2 billion in the first quarter as the company’s growing user base lured more advertisers to its platforms. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, up from about 73 percent a year earlier. The company said about 1.65 billion people were now using  Facebook at least once a month. “As long as the users are there, FB will find ways to monetize,” said Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter. Facebook has become one of the biggest beneficiaries as advertisers move money away from TV to Web and mobile platforms. Mahaney noted Facebook was developing better solutions for advertisers and investing in opportunities such as video ads, its messaging platforms WhatsApp and Messenger, photo-sharing app Instagram and virtual reality. All this puts Facebook on track to capture 18 percent of ad spending with digital media owners in countries outside of China this year, nearly double the 10 percent share the company held in 2014, Pivotal Research analysts said. Of the 49 analysts covering the stock, 45 rate it “buy” or higher, according to Thomson Reuters data. "
2012-05-09,-1,"A key concern for investors is Facebook’s slowing revenue growth, due in part to the widening trend of consumers accessing its service on smartphones, where Facebook provides limited ads. In an amended prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Facebook said the popularity of mobile devices has caused its number of daily users to grow faster than the number of ads it is delivering. Facebook described the number of mobile ads it has recently begun showing to users as “immaterial.” Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue from online ads, although it also collects fees when consumers purchase goods from within social apps, such as Zynga’s Farmville. The App Center will, for the first time, allow software developers to sell apps to consumers directly on Facebook. Consumers will need to use Facebook Credits, the company’s payment system, to purchase the apps and Facebook will take a 30 percent cut of the revenue as it does with in-app purchases, said Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich. Facebook is introducing the app service to give software developers additional options, but the company expects in-app purchases to remain more prevalent on the social network, said Lucich. Apps, ranging from social games to music services, are popular activities on Facebook, the world’s No.1 online social network with roughly 900 million users. According to the company, 200 of the apps that are available on Facebook have more than 1 million users. The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple Inc iPhones and Android smartphones. If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple’s App Store or Google Inc’s Play store to download the app. The App Center will showcase apps based on the quality scores that users give apps and other data Facebook collects, such as how often and how long people use apps. Each user will see a different, customized version of the App Center, rather than one standard version of the App Center. "

2012-05-11,-4,"The operator of the world’s biggest online social network has at no point said it planned to sell advertising on other Internet sites, but the policy changes would further expand its ability to do so. Facebook’s money-making potential has been spotlighted as the company prepares to raise up to $12 billion in its initial public offering. Some analysts and investors have pointed to Facebook’s slowing revenue growth as an area of concern. Analysts have long speculated about whether Facebook would join the likes of Google Inc and Yahoo Inc to create a so-called ad network that distributes the ads it sells to other websites. Facebook makes the lion’s share of its revenue selling ads on its website. Letting those ads appear on third-party websites would broaden their reach. Ads on Facebook itself are aimed at different slices of its audience, based on their personal information, such as age and marital status, as well as activities on the network such as those indicated by their “likes” for certain items or topics. The Menlo Park, California-based company said on Friday the changes in privacy policy are designed to take account of new features on the service as well as recommendations from Ireland’s privacy regulator, which released an extensive audit on Facebook’s privacy practices last year. The new privacy policy also provides more details on how Facebook uses consumer data to sell ads on the social network. It included a page devoted to the so-called cookies that Facebook, like many Web companies, places on users’ computers to help target ads to consumers. Privacy has been a challenging issue for Facebook and other online services in recent years. In November, Facebook settled a privacy case with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that subjects the company to 20 years of independent audits. Under its revised privacy policy, Facebook broadened the types of ads that it could potentially place on third-party websites. Facebook has previously said it could offer “social” ads - which incorporate information from a user’s friends - on third-party websites. The revision states that Facebook can offer any kind of ad on outside websites. Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan noted that the company does not offer ads on outside websites. But the network wanted to ensure that it has the “flexibility” to offer various types of ads should it ever decide to do so, she said. Facebook also changed the language about how long it will retain user data. Such information from advertisers will now be kept for 180 days, and Facebook will retain all types of data for “as long as necessary.” Exceptions to the 180-day policy may include, for example, a Facebook page created by an advertiser that showcases certain user information, Egan said. The company will offer a detailed chart of all the types of data it retains about its users at some point “down the road,” she added. Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit advocacy group for Internet user rights, said the change to the data retention language did not seem to be an area of concern. “They’re really just keeping it around for very narrow reasons,” said Brookman, whose firm receives funding from Facebook and other companies. Facebook’s policy changes will be open to a 7-day comment period from users. Any change which receives more than 7,000 comments will be put to a vote by Facebook users. If a particular comment receives 30 percent of votes supporting it from Facebook’s “active” users, it will go into effect."
2012-08-07,-3,"Facebook confirmed that it is partnering with Gamesys to allow gambling on its service. “Real money gaming is a popular and well-regulated activity in the UK and we are allowing a partner to offer their games to adult users on the Facebook platform in a safe and controlled manner,” Facebook said in a statement. Facebook spokeswoman Linda Griffin said there are no current plans to offer gambling in any other countries or with any other partners besides Gamesys. She declined to disclose what portion of the revenue Facebook would take from the gambling on the Gamesys games, but acknowledged that there was a revenue sharing agreement between Facebook and Gamesys. Facebook takes a 30 percent share of revenue for transactions on non-gambling games on its service, such as when users purchase virtual tractors and seeds in Zynga Inc’s popular Farmville game. Facebook, which makes the majority of its money from online advertising, has seen its revenue growth slow sharply during the past year. In the second quarter, Facebook reported revenue growth of 32 percent, down sharply from more than 100 percent growth it delivered at the same time last year. Shares of Facebook were down 3 percent at $21.26 on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq. "
2013-03-26,-1,"The move announced on Tuesday will incorporate this system, called Facebook Exchange, to the ads in Facebook’s News Feed. It ties together two of the most significant innovations that Facebook Inc has made in the past year to its advertising business, which accounts for roughly 84 percent of the company’s revenue. Marketers last year welcomed the launch of Facebook Exchange as it provided a common online advertising technique long missing on the social network. Ads that appear directly within the Facebook News Feed are considered crucial to its future business prospects since they can be seen on mobile devices such as smartphones. About two-thirds of Facebook users accessed the site on a mobile device in December. Facebook said the Facebook Exchange system will initially be available for newsfeed ads that appear on desktop PCs but not on mobile devices. “Desktop is more in line with what FBX (Facebook Exchange) has been doing effectively in the right hand side. And we also find that desktop is the place where more people convert from seeing direct-response ads,” said Facebook spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana. The company is testing the new service with a limited set of partners, with plans for broader availability in the coming weeks. Shares of Facebook closed 7 cents higher at $25.21 on Nasdaq. "

2016-01-29,1,"The move comes as the United States debates the issue of  access to guns after a string of mass shootings. U.S. President Barack Obama has urged social media companies to clamp down on gun sales organized on their platforms. It updates Facebook’s regulated goods policy, introduced in March 2014, that banned people from selling marijuana, pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs. Facebook already prohibited private firearms sellers from advertising “no background check required,” or offering transactions across U.S. state lines without a licensed dealer because the company said such posts indicated a willingness to evade the law. Licensed retailers will still be able to advertise firearms on Facebook that lead to transactions outside of Facebook’s service, the spokeswoman said. “Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another,” Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of product policy, said in a statement. “We are continuing to develop, test, and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution,” Bickert said. Facebook is the world’s most popular online social network, with 1.59 billion users across the globe, 219 million of them in the United States and Canada. The National Rifle Association, a lobbying group opposed to limits on U.S. gun ownership rights, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Groups advocating increased gun control applauded the new policy. “Moms are grateful for the leadership shown by Facebook today,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a part of the Everytown for Gun Safety campaign group. “Our continued relationship with Facebook resulted in today’s even stronger stance, which will prevent dangerous people from getting guns and save American lives.”"
2012-05-07,-3,"comScore’s new Mobile Metrix 2.0 report showed U.S. smartphone users spent 441 minutes per month, or 7 hours and 21 minutes, on Facebook in March. That compares with 391 minutes, or 6 hours and 31 minutes, for people who tapped into Facebook via a computer. In filing documents for its initial public offering, Facebook highlighted the importance of mobile while noting it does not generate meaningful revenue from mobile users. “If users increasingly access mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users,” the company writes in its filing documents, “our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected.” Beefing up its mobile strategy was part of the reason Facebook in April agreed to spend $1 billion to buy Instagram, a photo-sharing mobile app, analysts say. Historically, Facebook hasn’t shown ads to mobile users, although in March 2012 it started including “sponsored stories” in users’ mobile new feeds. March marks the first month comScore measured mobile usage -- for Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android and RIM’s  Blackberry -- on sites like Facebook. Facebook commands the lion’s share of smartphone users’ time, comScore data showed. The next-most popular services were check-in services Foursquare, with 146 minutes; microblogging service Twitter, with 114 minutes; and blogging-service Tumblr, with 68 minutes. Facebook likely racked up more minutes because people like to stay on to craft updates, read friends’ updates, and respond, said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. By contrast, “it doesn’t take that long to tweet,” he said. comScore previously reported that Facebook computer users spent 422.8 minutes on Facebook in December. But it says the March figure of 391 minutes doesn’t represent a drop because it is now calculating the data differently after learning it had been double-counting users in some limited instances due to certain sites alerting servers twice when users got on the sites and used Facebook plug-ins. It has now fixed the glitch, a spokesman said. The March numbers represent a rise of six minutes over February, when computer users spent 385 minutes on Facebook, comScore said. Facebook’s rich valuation -- approaching $100 billion at the high end -- is in part based on high levels of user engagement.  Facebook cautioned in its filing documents that as growth in its numbers of users slows, its “business performance will become increasingly dependent on (its) ability to increase levels of user engagement in current and new markets.” comScore said Facebook has about 158.9 million unique U.S. visitors who access the site on computers and 78 million who access it via mobile phones, although there is overlap between the two groups. Facebook declined to comment on the study."

2012-06-15,4,"* New ad formats could prove more alluring * Could fees for some services be in the offing? By Alistair Barr CHICAGO, June 15 (Reuters) - Krishan Agarwal, president of online luxury watch vendor Melrose.com, told a roomful of attentive Internet retailers last week how Facebook had helped his company generate about 25 percent more sales in two years. Then he dropped a bombshell: Melrose spent less than $1,500  on Facebook ads during that time. Everything else the company did with Facebook was free. “Some of the tools that are free are just a lot better than ads on Facebook,” the former Dalton Investments hedge fund analyst explained, echoing other attendees at the Internet Retailer Conference & Exhibition in Chicago. Agarwal’s experience goes to the heart of the issues confronting Facebook Inc as it tries to turn its giant global network into a money machine. Advertisers love the platform but don’t necessarily see the benefit in spending money on the ads. Facebook is hoping to allay some of the doubts with new ad formats that provide better tracking of customer behavior. It’s also beginning to insert ads directly into the “newsfeed,” the stream of updates that all users receive, which should in turn help the company address the challenge of delivering ads on mobile devices. Yet analysts increasingly suggest that over the long run, Facebook may have to begin charging for services that are currently free. Concerns about the company’s reliance on advertising offerings which, unlike rival Google‘s, have not proven themselves to be game-changers for customers have helped shave $25 billion from Facebook’s market value since it went public last month. “They’re in a huge pickle because most of their business is based on growth in advertising,” said Forrester Research’s Sucharita Mulpuru. But “why buy that cow when you get the milk for free?” The experience of online retailers, which comprise a big piece of the online ad market and are thus a crucial sector for Facebook to win over, provides a clear view of Facebook’s advertising challenge. “The retail sector isn’t buying it,” said Fiona Dias, chief strategy officer at ShopRunner, an e-commerce shipping company part-owned by eBay. “With all Facebook’s free stuff, retailers don’t have to worry whether it works very well. But the moment they pay a nickel, there has to be accountability.” Katie Ennis, e-commerce head at apparel retailer RCC Western Stores, said she had used Facebook ads until she sat down with the head of finance and analyzed the return on investment compared with other advertising the company uses. “The conversions were just not there. People would click on the ads sometimes but would not buy,” she said. “So we completely stopped doing Facebook ads earlier this year.” After about a month, RCC Western noticed a decline in sales. The retailer resumed running Facebook ads and sales recovered. “So Facebook ads are having an effect, but we’re not sure how and we can’t measure it,” Ennis said. Giantnerd was an early adopter of Facebook’s Open Graph project, which lets shoppers “love,” “want” and “own” products on the website of the outdoor goods retailer. When shoppers click on these buttons, those recommendations are shared with friends through their Facebook Timeline. Facebook highlighted Giantnerd’s success in a June blog, saying website traffic from Facebook more than tripled after the retailer integrated with Open Graph, a free service. CEO Randall Weidberg was less enthusiastic about traditional paid Facebook display ads. “It has its place, but won’t have amazing results,” he said during the conference. Facebook users, by contrast, are not typically looking for something to buy. They may get a product recommendation from a friend, then search for it elsewhere and buy days or weeks later. This makes it hard to attribute sales directly to Facebook ads, because purchases are often influenced by other things along the way. Four out of five people in a Reuters survey this month said they had never bought a product as a result of advertising on Facebook. CanvasPop, which turns Facebook and Instagram photos into canvas art, has seen success with fan pages and other free efforts such as contests. But co-founder Adrian Salamunovic said Facebook’s analytics service measures the impact of ads on “everything except revenue.” “We take advantage of all the free things,” he said. “Occasionally we spend money on Facebook ads for certain campaigns, with mixed results. If there was an out-of-the-box way of tracking revenue generated from Facebook ads, that would make a huge difference to a lot of people.” Facebook is searching for better ways to track impact. Brad Smallwood, its head of measurements and insights, said on Tuesday that Facebook is launching a competition with the Advertising Research Foundation to encourage new ways of measuring return on ad investment. Winners will get funding from Facebook to develop the projects, Smallwood said. “We haven’t given marketers a good understanding of how to evaluate these things,” he added. Facebook has also rolled out new types of paid ads recently - such as Sponsored Stories and Ads with Social - that may be easier to measure and track. “While advertisers to-date have seen mixed results from Facebook ads, ‘sponsored stories’ and offers are showing signs of improving results,” wrote Colin Sebastian, an analyst at RW Baird, in a recent investor note. Weidberg of Giantnerd agreed that the newer sponsored stories ads have been more successful. One of its newest ad formats is called Promoted Posts. When companies post updates for fans on their Facebook pages, the messages only reach some followers. They can now pay to get posts into the News Feeds of more of their fans. Advertisers who only use free marketing tools on Facebook “are leaving a huge opportunity on the table to reach more customers,” Facebook spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana said. Still, analysts have begun to speculate on if and when Facebook might begin charging fees for some of the services that are now free. “They could experiment with charging for Facebook pages if you are a certain sized retailer,” said Sebastian. “They have to be very careful though. They are trying to create as big a funnel as possible and over time try to monetize that. They would not want to limit the growth of the funnel at this point.” Facebook spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana declined to comment on the possibility of future fees."
2013-06-06,1,"The world’s No. 1 social network, which is seeking to revive revenue growth, will still display ads inside users’ newsfeeds and on the right-hand side of its webpages. But it will sharply reduce the options marketers can choose for those so-called ad units. “What we realized is that even though every ad product is really good on its own, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It should really be simpler,” Fidji Simo, a Facebook product manager for ads, said at an event at the company’s Menlo Park, California headquarters on Thursday. The changes will be rolled out over the coming weeks and months. Advertising accounts for 85 percent of Facebook’s revenue, and it is trying to reinvigorate revenue growth following a sharp slowdown early last year. With consumers increasingly accessing Facebook on mobile devices such as smartphones, Facebook has scrambled to roll out new types of ad formats suited to small mobile screens. Facebook has also begun letting advertisers show ads based on users’ Web browsing history and has introduced tools that allow marketers to better measure ad effectiveness. The company is widely expected to introduce video ads this year, but it made no mention of them at the event on Thursday. Facebook shares have fallen about 15 percent so far this year, compared with the Dow Jones industrial average’s 14 percent rise. As part of the changes, Facebook will ask marketers to choose from six or seven, instead of 27, different objectives, such as driving foot traffic to a real-world store or generating “likes” for a company’s page. Facebook will then suggest a couple of different ad formats. “Offers” ads for product discount coupons, for example, will no longer be a separate category for online merchants. Instead, a general ad unit will include the link for a coupon. Merchants with brick and mortar stores will still have a separate “offers” ad unit. Facebook executives noted that marketers will still be able to select ads that run only on mobile devices or on personal computers."
2015-01-28,2,"The Internet social networking company, which has dazzled with two years of breakneck revenue growth, is struggling to win support for plans to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure and businesses ranging from virtual reality headsets to satellites. Facebook shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after the company beat Wall Street’s fourth-quarter revenue target and discussed aggressive 2015 spending plans. The stock has fallen 7.6 percent since late October, when it first outlined these plans. “Expectations for Facebook are already very high and perhaps some commentary around aggressive investments can spook investors a bit,” said Colin Sebastian, a Robert W. Baird & Co analyst. Facebook said on Wednesday that 2015 capital expenditures will range from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion, a sharp increase from $1.83 billion in 2014. While Facebook slightly narrowed the range of its expected  increase in 2015 operating expenses, the projected level remains well above previous levels. Facebook’s staff grew 45 percent to 9,200 employees in 2014 through hiring and buying a string of companies. The hiring shows no signs of slowing down, with listings for more than 1,200 positions posted on Facebook’s website earlier this month. The spending spree comes as Facebook faces intensifying competition with Twitter Inc, Google Inc and a host of well-capitalized Web startups such as Snapchat. “They’re looking at a lot of investment around data and video and search which are expensive,” said Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena, noting that Facebook was doing a good job convincing investors about the need to invest. Facebook has acquired a collection of popular products, including messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing app Instagram. But Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has made clear he is in no rush to profit from the new services yet. Robert Baird analyst Sebastian noted that by focusing on adding users to the new services, Facebook is creating more opportunities to place online ads, which should give investors some comfort. Facebook is also racing Google to build expensive satellites and drones to expand Internet connectivity to remote regions of the world. Why should shareholders care about that, one analyst asked Zuckerberg during the conference call after Facebook released earnings. “It matters to the kind of investor we want to have,” replied Zuckerberg.

2014-08-07,-7,"Facebook did not disclose financial terms for the acquisition of PrivateCore, which was founded in 2011 and is based in Palo Alto, California. PrivateCore raised $2.25 million in funding in 2012 from Foundation Capital. Facebook, the world’s largest Internet social network with 1.32 billion monthly users, said that PrivateCore’s technology can “validate and secure” server data and can protect computer servers from “persistent malware, unauthorized physical access, and malicious hardware devices.” “I’ve seen how much people care about the security of data they entrust to services like Facebook,” Facebook Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan wrote in a post on Facebook announcing the deal.

2016-07-28,0,"By Tenzin Pema and Anya George Tharakan July 28 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc is growing so fast analysts can’t keep up. The social networking giant beat market expectations for profit and revenue yet again in the latest quarter, pushing up its shares to a record high on Thursday and allowing it to overtake Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc as the fifth biggest U.S. company by market capitalization. Facebook’s shares rose as much as 4 percent to $128.33, boosting its market value by $14 billion to $367 billion - enough to eclipse Berkshire’s market cap of about $355 billion. At least 20 brokerages raised target prices on Facebook’s stock, with a median target of $150. Of 50 analysts covering the stock, 46 have a “buy” or higher rating, 3 have a “hold,” and only one has a “sell.” Analysts said Facebook’s “video first” strategy would help drive the company’s growth well into the future as more advertisers move money to mobile platforms. Facebook also has a huge opportunity to monetize its WhatsApp and Messenger services as well as do more with photo-sharing app Instagram and virtual reality unit Oculus. “While FB could be reaching a saturation point in more developed markets, we believe there several levers to drive rev growth,” Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi said in a note. These include more videos to increase time spent online and  new ad formats, he said, as well as monetizing other services. Doshi raised his price target to $150 from $140. Facebook, which now has more than 1.7 billion monthly users, said its ad revenue surged 63 percent in the second quarter, with mobile accounting for 84 percent of the total. “To give a sense of the scale of Facebook’s beat, its advertising outperformance vs. consensus expectations was almost as large as the total advertising revenue base in the quarter for the industry’s #4 player, Twitter,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said in a client note. “VIDEO-IFICATION OF THE INTERNET” Twitter, which on Tuesday reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public in 2013, is betting on video as well to revive its flagging fortunes. But analysts think its turnaround will take a long time. In the meantime, Facebook shows no sign of slowing down. Facebook’s record quarterly profit and revenue trounced Wall Street estimates as the company’s mobile app and push into video helped it win new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more. Facebook has been beefing up its presence in the mobile video market, where Snapchat and Alphabet Inc’s  YouTube pose strong competition, and it is also courting advertisers and content providers to experiment with Facebook Live, its new live video feature. “We see a world that is video-first with video at the heart of all of our apps and services,” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call on Wednesday. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, who raised his price target to $170 from $165, called it the “video-ification of the internet.” “And FB is extremely well positioned for this,” he said in research note. Only one brokerage cut its rating on Facebook’s stock. Moness Crespi & Hardt, which had a “buy” recommendation, reduced its rating to “neutral”. The brokerage raised concerns about the large capital spending it said would be required to build Facebook’s video offerings.

2012-06-21,-6,"The potential loss of revenue to Facebook resulting from the changes is the equivalent of about $103 million, in the opinion of one economist hired by the plaintiffs. A “Sponsored Story” is an advertisement that appears on a member’s Facebook page and generally consists of another friend’s name, profile picture and an assertion that the person “likes” the advertiser. Five Facebook members filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status against the social networking site, saying it violated California law by publicizing  users’ “likes” of certain advertisers without paying them or giving them a way to opt out. Under the terms of a settlement agreement filed on Wednesday, Facebook members will be able to control which content can be used for Sponsored Stories. Facebook agreed to maintain these changes and other new disclosures for at least two years, according to court documents. Attorneys for the plaintiffs say the changes to “Sponsored Stories” are worth $103.2 million, based on an economist’s analysis of the revenue each ad brings to Facebook. Those revenue figures were redacted in the court documents. A Facebook representative declined to comment, and an attorney for the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached. The settlement agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. She must weigh whether the deal’s terms adequately benefit class members. Previous court filings had revealed that Facebook agreed to pay $10 million to charity as part of the settlement deal. The social networking company will also pay an additional $10 million for plaintiff attorneys’ fees, according to the court documents.

2012-05-11,-4,"The operator of the world’s biggest online social network has at no point said it planned to sell advertising on other Internet sites, but the policy changes would further expand its ability to do so. Facebook’s money-making potential has been spotlighted as the company prepares to raise up to $12 billion in its initial public offering. Some analysts and investors have pointed to Facebook’s slowing revenue growth as an area of concern. Analysts have long speculated about whether Facebook would join the likes of Google Inc and Yahoo Inc to create a so-called ad network that distributes the ads it sells to other websites. Facebook makes the lion’s share of its revenue selling ads on its website. Letting those ads appear on third-party websites would broaden their reach. Ads on Facebook itself are aimed at different slices of its audience, based on their personal information, such as age and marital status, as well as activities on the network such as those indicated by their “likes” for certain items or topics. The Menlo Park, California-based company said on Friday the changes in privacy policy are designed to take account of new features on the service as well as recommendations from Ireland’s privacy regulator, which released an extensive audit on Facebook’s privacy practices last year. The new privacy policy also provides more details on how Facebook uses consumer data to sell ads on the social network. It included a page devoted to the so-called cookies that Facebook, like many Web companies, places on users’ computers to help target ads to consumers. Privacy has been a challenging issue for Facebook and other online services in recent years. In November, Facebook settled a privacy case with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that subjects the company to 20 years of independent audits. Under its revised privacy policy, Facebook broadened the types of ads that it could potentially place on third-party websites. Facebook has previously said it could offer “social” ads - which incorporate information from a user’s friends - on third-party websites. The revision states that Facebook can offer any kind of ad on outside websites. Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan noted that the company does not offer ads on outside websites. But the network wanted to ensure that it has the “flexibility” to offer various types of ads should it ever decide to do so, she said. Facebook also changed the language about how long it will retain user data. Such information from advertisers will now be kept for 180 days, and Facebook will retain all types of data for “as long as necessary.” Exceptions to the 180-day policy may include, for example, a Facebook page created by an advertiser that showcases certain user information, Egan said. The company will offer a detailed chart of all the types of data it retains about its users at some point “down the road,” she added. Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit advocacy group for Internet user rights, said the change to the data retention language did not seem to be an area of concern. “They’re really just keeping it around for very narrow reasons,” said Brookman, whose firm receives funding from Facebook and other companies. Facebook’s policy changes will be open to a 7-day comment period from users. Any change which receives more than 7,000 comments will be put to a vote by Facebook users. If a particular comment receives 30 percent of votes supporting it from Facebook’s “active” users, it will go into effect. "

Facebook executives are hoping to net even more small advertisers since 16 million local businesses, ranging from jewelry sellers to clothing stores, set up free pages on the network. While pinpointing how much money small advertisers spend only online is difficult, in total they spent approximately $32 billion during 2012 in the United States, according to market research firm eMarketer. “Most small business owners start off as Facebook users, then migrate to become page owners, and from there migrate to become advertisers,” said Dan Levy, Facebook director of small business. He said that Facebook does not plan to start charging businesses to set up pages. Advertising accounts for 85 percent of Facebook’s revenue - which also includes dollars from the world’s largest brands and advertising agencies. But the company is trying to spark its ad growth following a sharp slowdown last year. Last quarter, Facebook reported first-quarter revenue of $1.46 billion. Advertising revenue rose 43 percent, the fastest growth rate since the end of 2011. Facebook declined to break out how much ad revenue comes from small businesses and did not indicate how long it took to reach the 1 million milestone. It has introduced several initiatives to help boost growth, including an overhaul of its newsfeed and changes to how advertisers buy ads on the network in order to simplify the process. Small business owners are “critical” to Facebook’s success, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. “Once they launched new ad products targeted to small businesses in the middle of last year, they were able to significantly accelerate their revenue growth,” he said. Kim Caulfield, a small business owner in Orange County, California who sells custom jewelry made from horse tail hair, started using Facebook advertising to reach more customers for her company Tail Spin. “You only can invite so many of your friends over and most of them don’t own horses,” she said. She now spends approximately $25 a day with Facebook on advertisements directed to horse enthusiasts with the potential of reaching over 5 million people. Facebook also reaches out to local businesses order to help them through the process. Dallas-area clothing boutique owner Lucy Huang said she was part of a Facebook incubator program to mentor businesses and walk them through the ad buying process. Huang said she spends roughly $50 a month advertising Accents retail stores with Facebook, saying it is cheaper and more effective than print or online rivals like Yelp. More than 50 percent of small business owners use Facebook pages to promote their products, but only 16 percent use Facebook ads, according to BIA Kelsey, a research firm specializing in local advertising.

Since then, Facebook has introduced a number of tools and partnerships to prove to marketers that advertising on its social network delivers enough bang for the buck. Brian Boland, Facebook’s director of monetization product marketing, said the purchase of Atlas was not a step toward creating a much wider ad network beyond the Facebook site, but analysts believe that is Facebook’s ultimate goal. “Although the statement announcing the deal focused on Atlas’ measurement tools rather than its ad targeting technology, we expect that Atlas will soon be using Facebook’s data to target sponsorships, in-stream ads, and other rich ad formats across the entire web, and that’s big news,” said Forrester analyst Nate Elliott. “The question now is how quickly and successfully Facebook can integrate its data with Atlas’ tools, and whether they can avoid a privacy backlash as they do so.

2012-07-03,-4,"* Top GM, Facebook executives have communicated since GM dropped ads By Ben Klayman and Gerry Shih DETROIT/SAN FRANCISO, July 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co  and Facebook Inc are discussing the return of the U.S. automaker as a paid advertiser almost two months after GM said it would stop running ads on the social networking website, sources close to the situation said on Tuesday. Although the two companies remain far from reaching an agreement, Facebook executives have assiduously courted the world’s largest carmaker. One source said Facebook was not pushing for GM’s immediate return, but offered to provide data showing the effectiveness of the website’s paid ads. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg sent GM Chief Executive Dan Akerson an e-mail urging the company to reconsider its decision shortly after the third-largest U.S. advertiser pulled its ads in May, a move that undermined confidence in Facebook on the eve of its highly-anticipated initial public offering, according to sources who were not permitted to speak publicly because the talks are ongoing. At a global advertising conference in Cannes, France, last month, Facebook global sales head Carolyn Everson sought out GM’s global marketing chief Joel Ewanick to continue face-to-face talks, leaving open the option of GM returning to the fold, sources said. Facebook offered the same information it provides to all of its big advertisers, but did not offer any concessions. GM and Facebook declined comment. The news was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. Three days before Facebook’s May 18 IPO GM said it was dropping paid ads on the website because they had little impact on consumers. The decision by the carmaker, which spent $10 million on Facebook in 2011, was the first highly visible crack in Facebook’s strategy and underscored doubts about whether advertising on Facebook works better than traditional media. GM emphasized at the time that it would retain its Facebook pages, for which it paid no fees, to market its cars and trucks. People familiar with a meeting that took place before GM’s announcement in May said Facebook officials failed to convince GM’s top marketing executives of the value of Facebook’s paid ads. GM, which ranks behind Procter & Gamble Co and AT&T Inc in advertising spending, spent $1.1 billion on U.S. ads last year, according to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media. Overall, GM’s spending on advertising rose 5.2 percent last year to $4.48 billion, according to the automaker’s annual report. It spent about $271 million on online display and search ads excluding Facebook advertising, Kantar said. GM previously said it spends about $40 million on its Facebook presence, but only about $10 million of that was paid to Facebook for advertising. The remaining budget covers the creation of content and the advertising and media agencies involved, the newspaper said. GM also announced in May it would not advertise in next year’s Super Bowl because it was too expensive. Ewanick has led a consolidation of GM’s ad agencies globally that is expected to save the Detroit company $2 billion over five years."

2012-05-21,-7,"* Top line growth most important now - investor * Company’s focus won’t change due to stock slide, say some By Alexei Oreskovic and Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 21 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s  underwhelming debut on Wall Street increases the pressure on the social networking giant to deliver stellar growth - a novel situation for Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has been clear he is more interested in building products than making money. Facebook shares fell 11 percent on Monday, the company’s second day as a publicly traded company, due to what many analysts and investors blamed on overly aggressive pricing by Facebook’s underwriters, as well as a decision to expand the size of the offering by 25 percent. The poor stock market performance has intensified the scrutiny of Facebook’s business, raising the bar for the company to regain Wall Street’s confidence, say some investors and analysts. “What’s most important now to investors is top line growth,” said Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. “If they’re interested in seeing their stock work, they need to have a good quarter,” he said, referring to Facebook. Falling below the offering price is damaging to investor “psyche” noted Binger, who has personally bought some shares in Facebook but whose firm does not have a position. “People who usually would be buying are now going ‘Something is seriously going wrong here.’ Emotions and skepticism take over,” he said. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011, with net income of $1 billion - a sharp contrast to some of the money-losing Web companies such as Groupon Inc and Pandora Media Inc, that have recently gone public. But Facebook’s revenue growth has been slowing in recent quarters, raising flags among some investors who believe a company such as Facebook should be delivering consistently strong revenue growth at this stage in its life. “Wall Street is a severe task master and they’re going to want to see quarterly results, then guidance, then subsequently they’re going to want to see that guidance beaten, and then the guidance raised,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners. “Either they deliver those results and make folks happy, or they’re going to see another element of Wall Street, that ‘Hey - when you have a richly valued stock you must deliver, or the stock’s going to correct and correct hard,'” said Rolfe. Shares of Facebook, which priced at $38 in last week’s IPO, finished Monday’s regular session at $34.03, with more than 168 million shares trading hands -- more than seven times the volume of Apple Inc on Monday. In Facebook’s prospectus, Zuckerberg wrote in a letter to investors that “we don’t build services to make money; we make money to build better services” and referred to the company’s “social mission.” It’s precisely Zuckerberg’s long-term perspective and his product-first approach that many investors are betting on. “Everything that I understand about the company is that they’re trying to build something for the long term,” said Ken Allen, a partner at The Blackstone Group. “The idea that simply because the IPO trades down after a couple days that Mark Zuckerberg is going to change drastically...I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Still, he noted that Facebook’s falling stock price was “certainly a negative from a kind of momentum standpoint and potentially an employee morale standpoint.” With 900 million users, Facebook has become one of the Web’s most popular online destinations, challenging established businesses such as Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. Among the key challenges for Facebook is consumers’ use of smartphones to access the mobile version of the service on which Facebook currently shows only limited ads. Just before the IPO, Facebook in a regulatory filing flagged this as an area of concern due to the lower revenue potential of mobile. Some marketers have also questioned the long-term potential of Facebook’s main advertising business, with General Motors’  decision to stop spending money on Facebook ads last week underscoring the concerns. While Google’s search-oriented advertising has proven consistently effective and profitable, and continues to grow, Facebook has yet to show that its huge store of personal information about its users user will translate into similarly high-margin advertising on a mass scale. Facebook’s dual-class share structure, which gives Zuckerberg majority control, and other governance practices such as Zuckerberg’s role as CEO and Chairman of the board, have also been criticized. While Facebook’s corporate governance practices leave much to be desired, the company is unlikely to feel any real pressure for change from investors for some time, said James Post, a professor of management at Boston University. If the company were to make a costly strategic blunder which raised questions about Zuckerberg’s leadership, that might increase pressure for change, said Post. At this point however, Post said, “the sentiment is just the opposite. What investors are really betting on is his continued leadership of the company.”"
2012-09-20,2,"The service has been free, but in coming weeks Facebook will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans. The cost will vary based on the size of a company’s Facebook pages. Since Facebook went public in May, the company has been under pressure from Wall Street to show how it can turn its giant social network into a money machine. Facebook shares have lost about 40 percent of their value since the IPO. The commerce potential of Facebook, known as f-commerce, has yet to materialize, partly because retailers have been able to feast on a host of free tools on the social network to attract customers. Tying Facebook Offers to a paid ad service suggests the company is working to change this. “We think this aligns incentives nicely,” said Gokul Rajaram, director of product management for Facebook’s advertising and Pages businesses. “The best results on Facebook Offers will come from organic distribution plus paid distribution.” “The requirement to pay for related ads will focus merchants on who and where they want the offer to reach,” he said. Facebook is also expanding Offers to online-only businesses, he added. Before, the service was available only to merchants with physical locations. Facebook is also adding barcodes for offers, so customers can redeem offers more easily. The barcodes work globally, Rajaram noted. The executive declined to disclose how many Facebook Offers have been run so far, how many merchants have taken part, or how many deals have been claimed and redeemed by consumers. However, he said Facebook is “very happy” with the success of its Offers business. “That’s why we’re expanding and investing more in it,” Rajaram said. "
2012-04-04,-17,"The dueling claims mark an expanding web of patent litigation that has already caught up the smartphone and tablet sectors and high-tech stalwarts such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. Yahoo’s lawsuit against Facebook came at a delicate time, as the world’s largest Internet social networking service is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $100 billion. Observers have said that companies are usually more vulnerable to patent suits when they are in the IPO process, as investors scrutinize the risks involved in the business. But Facebook’s counterclaim comes as Yahoo addresses its own challenges: the Web pioneer has seen declining revenue, and newly installed Chief Executive Scott Thompson is facing a contentious proxy fight with activist hedge fund Third Point. Yahoo spokesman Eric Berman said Facebook’s counterclaim is “nothing more than a cynical attempt to distract from the weakness of its defense.” Five of the patents asserted by Facebook target features related to Yahoo’s online advertising business, which Facebook pegged at 80 percent of Yahoo’s 2011 revenue, according to the counterclaim. Yahoo’s Flickr photo sharing service infringed various Facebook patents involving the ability to connect with other users on the online service, to identify people in a photo and to generate personalized news feeds, according to the filing. At least one of the patents asserted by Facebook -- a method for tagging digital media -- lists its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, as one of the inventors, according to a U.S. government database. Facebook General Counsel Ted Ullyot said the company had indicated that it would defend itself vigorously in the face of Yahoo’s lawsuit. “While we are asserting patent claims of our own, we do so in response to Yahoo’s short-sighted decision to attack one of its partners and prioritize litigation over innovation,” Ullyot said in a statement. Yahoo has claimed Facebook infringed 10 of Yahoo’s patents, including several that cover online advertising technology. In its lawsuit, Yahoo said Facebook was considered “one of the worst performing sites for advertising” prior to adapting Yahoo’s ideas. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Yahoo Inc. v. Facebook Inc., 12-cv-1212. Yahoo shares fell 2.4 percent to $15.09 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. "

2012-11-02,-2,"Sandberg netted about $7.44 million by selling roughly 353,000 Facebook shares on Wednesday, according to a filing with the SEC on Friday. Sandberg still owns 18.1 million vested shares of Facebook stock, according to the filing. Facebook General Counsel Theodore Ullyot and Chief Accounting Officer David Spillane also sold millions of dollars worth of shares this week, according to filings. All the Facebook executives’ sales were part of pre-arranged stock trading plans. The sales are the first by Facebook’s senior management following the company’s high-profile initial public offering in May. The world’s No.1 online social network became the only U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion, but has seen its value plunge more than 40 percent since then on concerns about its long-term money-making prospects. Shares of Facebook, which were priced at $38 in the IPO, closed Friday’s regular session down 3 cents at $21.18. The flood of shares set to hit the market as insider trading “lock-up” provisions expire in several phases have added to the pressure on Facebook’s stock. Roughly 230 million shares of Facebook became eligible for trading this week, as trading restrictions for employees expired. Another 800 million shares will be eligible for trading on Nov. 14, significantly expanding the “float” of roughly 692 million Facebook shares that were available for trading as of Sept. 30. Facebook’s 28-year-old chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has committed to not sell any shares before September 2013. Ullyot sold slightly more than 149,000 shares on Wednesday and Thursday, collecting $3.13 million. Ullyot has an additional 1.27 million in vested shares. Spillane sold 256,000 shares on Wednesday, more than half of his vested shares, for proceeds of $5.4 million. Spillane had more than 863,000 Facebook shares, including unvested shares, according to a filing in May. "
2012-06-16,-7,"The lawsuit, brought by five Facebook members, alleged the social networking site violated California law by publicizing  users’ “likes” of certain advertisers on its “Sponsored Stories” feature without paying them or giving them a way to opt out, the documents said. A “Sponsored Story” is an advertisement that appears on a member’s Facebook page and generally consists of another friend’s name, profile picture and an assertion that the person “likes” the advertiser. The settlement was reached last month but made public this weekend. Facebook declined to comment on Saturday. The proposed class-action lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, could have included nearly one of every three Americans, with billions of dollars in damages, according to previous court documents. In the lawsuit, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was quoted as saying that a trusted referral was the “Holy Grail” of advertising. In addition, the lawsuit cited comments from Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, saying that the value of a “Sponsored Story” advertisement was at least twice and up to three times the value of a standard Facebook.com ad without a friend endorsement. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said the plaintiffs had shown economic injury could occur through Facebook’s use of their names, photographs and likenesses. “California has long recognized a right to protect one’s name and likeness against appropriation by others for their advantage,” Koh wrote. The settlement arrangement is known as a cy-pres settlement, meaning the settlement funds can go to charity. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Angel Fraley et al., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-1726. Facebook shares closed at $30.01 on Friday, down 21 percent since the company’s initial public offering last month."
2012-06-15,-2,"“Assuming that the trend towards mobile continues and your mobile monetization efforts are unsuccessful, ensure that your disclosure fully addresses the potential consequences to your revenue and financial results rather than just stating that they ‘may be negatively affected,'” the SEC wrote in a Feb. 28 letter to Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman. In another letter to Ebersman dated March 22, the SEC asked whether Facebook’s mobile monthly average users, or MAUs, were increasing in regions where the use of PCs was less prevalent. Facebook responded by changing some of its disclosures in amended IPO filings. In a March 27 letter to the SEC from Facebook’s lawyers at Fenwick & West, the company said it updated disclosures to include information on countries where it experienced the most significant growth in mobile MAUs. However, Facebook also noted that it had seen growth in mobile MAUs in countries where PC use was prevalent, such as the United States, as well as countries where PCs are not so popular, such as Mexico. This back and forth between the SEC and companies is typical during big IPOs. “We responded to all SEC comments over the course of this correspondence and the SEC declared our registration statement effective on May 17,” a Facebook spokesman said on Friday. However, the growth of mobile Facebook users became a big issue toward the end of the IPO process. On May 9, the company updated its IPO filing to warn that advertising growth was not keeping up with user growth in the second quarter, as more people accessed the social network through mobile devices. That additional disclosure was not in response to SEC questions. Instead, Facebook had seen a continuation of the mobile trend during the first month or so of the second quarter and decided to update investors. The amended May 9 IPO filing triggered estimate cuts by analysts at the banks underwriting the IPO, putting a financial and legal cloud over the offering."
2012-06-12,-3,"“The Power of Like 2: How Social Media Works,” looks at  paid advertising on Facebook as well as earned media exposure-- meaning mentions of the brand made by Facebook users in status updates and the like. It is based on the experiences of large brands such as Best Buy, Starbucks and Target . The report follows up on a July 2011 paper, “The Power of Like: How Brands Reach and Influence Fans Through Social Media Marketing.” It swipes back at recent research questioning the effectiveness of Facebook messages. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published last week showed four out of five Facebook users haven’t bought a product or service as a result of advertising or comments on Facebook. Most brand exposures on Facebook occur through users’ news feeds, comScore said, rather than visits to dedicated brand pages on Facebook. Fans - consumers who click a button that they like a certain brand or product - tend to outspend others for that particular brand, comScore said, citing examples such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. Purchase data comes via information from loyalty clubs, credit card companies, and third-party collectors, with the permission of the study participant. In the case of Target, Facebook and comScore studied two groups. One group, made up of fans of Target and their friends, saw “earned” messages about Target - updates about Target that run in news feeds and the like. The second group was made up of Facebook users who weren’t fans of Target and saw no messages. Both groups had identical purchase behavior at Target prior to the study. After the four-week study, the fans who saw the messages were 19 percent more likely to buy goods at Target than the 	 group that didn’t see the messages, and their friends were 27 percent more likely. A comScore spokesman said he didn’t know how much messaging the groups were exposed to. To measure the impact of paid advertising, ComScore conducted a similar study involving a national retailer. It looked at groups of Facebook users who were exposed to a paid online Facebook campaign about that brand, and a test group that was not. Again, the two groups had identical purchase behavior before the study. By the fourth week of the study, the group that saw the messages was 16 percent more likely to buy goods at the retailer than the group that did not see the messages. Separately, Facebook said it had conducted research on about 60 campaigns to measure their return on investment, or how many dollars in sales were generated by every dollar spent on Facebook advertising. About 70 percent of campaigns showed a return of three times or more on the money spent for the advertising, a spokeswoman said. About half of campaigns showed a return of five times or better. Evaluating the effectiveness of advertising has proved challenging for Madison Avenue, no matter the media, brands have long said. They find it hard to gauge how many people saw a particular ad, and connecting the message with purchases is even more difficult. Facebook is a comScore client. Along with many other large brands, it hires comScore to measure advertising effectiveness. Shares of Facebook closed at $27 Monday, down slightly from Friday’s close of $27.10, and 29 percent below their offering price of $38 on May 18. "
2012-06-15,-6,"In court papers filed late on Thursday before the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, Facebook and the banks said the U.S. District Court in Manhattan was the “most appropriate and convenient forum to oversee these coordinated and/or consolidated proceedings.” Over a dozen separate federal shareholder lawsuits have accused Facebook and the underwriters of hiding the social networking company’s weakened growth forecasts ahead of the May 18 stock offering, one of the largest ever IPOs. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc has also been sued by investors who claimed the exchange operator was negligent in handling orders for Facebook shares."
2014-04-09,0,"The new right-hand display ads will be the same proportions as the so-called News Feed ads, which inject paid marketing messages straight into a user’s stream of news and content. That will make advertising on Facebook simpler for marketers, since they will no longer need to use different images for different types of ads, Facebook said in a post on its Facebook for Business blog. In tests of the new ad design, Facebook said it has seen up to three times more user “engagement” with the ads. The company did not provide specifics, but typically the term means some kind of user interaction such as clicking on the ad, posting a comment or resharing it. Facebook did not specify how many ads will now appear in the right-hand column, though a sample image on the blog showed a single ad in the right-hand column. The company previously displayed as many as seven box-like display ads in the right hand column. Facebook, which has more than 1.2 billion users, said some advertisers will begin seeing the new option later this month. The changes affect only the PC version of Facebook’s website, which now accounts for less than half of its ad revenue as Facebook users and marketers increasingly favor the mobile version of its service.

2013-10-16,1,"The No.1 online social network said that teenagers would now be able to manually alter the setting and share information with the public. Until now, a teenager’s postings on Facebook were only viewable to their friends, and to the friends of their friends. However, Facebook said on Wednesday the default setting when teens do share information on the 1.15 billion user network would go out to a narrower group of people. “Teens are among the savviest people using of social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard,” Facebook said in an announcement of the changes. “While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services,” the company said. The change comes as Facebook faces increasing competition from a new crop of mobile and social services, such as SnapChat and WhatsApp, that have proven popular with younger users. Facebook said it would show teenage users a special notice the first couple of times they attempt to post information to the public, reminding the user that the post can be seen by anyone."
2012-05-23,-3,"Facebook should be valued based on the revenue potential from total minutes spent on the website, Needham analysts said, setting a $40 price target on the stock. Facebook shares were up 4 percent at $32.35 in early trade on the Nasdaq. About 14 percent of the total time spent online across the world is on Facebook, suggesting that the company’s revenue potential is $14 billion globally and $6 billion from the United States alone, the brokerage said. Facebook posted $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011. Facebook should have higher revenue than Google Inc over time because the number of users are about the same but the average time spent by a person on the website is three times more than on Google.com, the brokerage said. Google’s revenue was $37.91 billion in 2011. “(Facebook‘s) global platform with long engagement times gives it a unique strategic position to generate revenue from global advertisers, payments, services, etc,” said Laura Martin in a note to clients. “It also represents a meaningful barrier to entry.” Needham’s Martin is rated four stars by Thomson Reuters StarMine for the accuracy of her earnings estimates on the companies under her coverage. Google views Facebook as a threat and is moving aggressively to integrate social networking features across its products. Facebook, whose margins are significantly higher than Google’s in its first five years of existence, has about 900 million monthly users after eight years in existence compared with Google’s 1 billion after 14 years, the brokerage said. Facebook’s operating margins are enormous and expanding, Needham said. “This powerful economic engine suggests profit growth will be faster than revenue growth.” S&P Capital IQ, however, started Facebook with a “sell” rating raising questions about the effectiveness of its advertising platform, margins on marketing messages on mobiles, and risks related to the use of sensitive personal details. The brokerage, in a report dated May 22, set a $30 price target on the stock. The company’s initial public offering on Friday did not go as planned its sky-high valuation combined with trading glitches left the stock languishing below its offering price of $38. "
2014-04-09,2,"Facebook plans to eventually require that users in all countries install the Messenger app, spokesman Derick Mains said, though he could not provide a specific timeframe for the change. The move is intended to ensure that users have a consistent and high-quality experience, a Facebook spokesman told Reuters. The free, standalone Messenger app is faster than the messaging service that’s currently built into Facebook’s primary mobile app. Facebook users can also access more features in the Messenger app, such as the ability to make voice phone calls. “We have built a fast and reliable messaging experience through Messenger and now it makes sense for us to focus all our energy and resources on that experience,” the company said in a statement. Facebook faces increasing competition from a new crop of fast-growing mobile messaging apps, such as Snapchat and Line. It stunned observers by announcing plans in February to buy the popular WhatsApp messaging app for $19 billion. Forcing users to install a separate messaging app on their phones could help boost the popularity of Facebook Messenger, but could also cause a backlash if consumers view Facebook’s move as heavy-handed. A post on the technology blog Mashable on Wednesday was titled “11 Reasons why Pulling Messenger From Facebook Mobile is a Terrible Idea,” and many people took to Twitter to post critical comments about the change. Facebook, the world’s No.1 social networking service with 1.2 billion users, has increasingly moved to develop a catalog of standalone apps to complement its main app. In January, Facebook launched Paper, a photo-heavy news-reading app that has earned positive reviews. Facebook also acquired photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and announced plans to buy WhatsApp, which has more than 450 million users. News of the change in Facebook’s messaging service was first reported by the technology blog TechCrunch on Wednesday. "

2012-06-19,-22,"The company said it employs “hundreds” of staffers in several offices around the world to handle the millions of user reports it receives every week about everything from spam to threats of violence. A detailed, and somewhat confusing, chart published by Facebook on its website on Tuesday depicts how reports of various infractions are routed through the company and lays out all the potential outcomes, which can range from an account being disabled to Facebook alerting law enforcement. Facebook spokesman Fred Wolens said the company decided to publish the chart to provide more “transparency” about how user reports are dealt with. “There was a feeling that once users clicked ‘report,’ it was not immediately clear what happens,” Wolens said. The user reports are one way that Facebook maintains order on its service, where U.S. users spend more than six hours per month sharing videos and photos, playing video games and listening to music, according to research firm comScore. Facebook, which last month had one of the largest initial public offerings in U.S. history but whose stock has since fallen below its offering price, competes with Google Inc, Yahoo Inc and other Web companies as a top online destination. ‘CORE VALUE PROPOSITION’ Specialized technology and teams of Facebook staffers actively monitor the website to detect and remove content that violates its policies, such as hate speech, bullying and harassment and pornography. Facebook’s “core value proposition is that the Web is kind of a messy and dangerous place, unlike Facebook which is a safer place for you and your friends,” said Ray Valdes, an analyst with research firm Gartner. In a posting accompanying the chart on Tuesday, Facebook explained that its User Operations group comprises four teams to handle the different types of incident reports: a safety team, a hate and harassment team, an access team and an abusive content team. A user report about a threat of vandalism for instance would be handled by Facebook’s safety team, which would have the option of referring the matter to law enforcement, warning the user, or disabling the user’s account. Facebook’s Wolens said the company does not disclose how often it refers incidents to law enforcement authorities. A user can also appeal a decision disabling their account to a separate group at Facebook. But even Facebook’s defenses sometimes fail, as in November when numerous users reported seeing a flood of explicitly violent images in their newsfeeds. Facebook blamed the incident on a “coordinated spam attack that exploited a browser vulnerability” according to media reports at the time. "
2012-10-04,-12,"A panel of federal judges on Thursday ordered that cases filed around the United States be transferred to U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan. Facebook had requested the consolidation, while some investors sought to keep their cases in California. Facebook said in a statement that it was pleased with the ruling, and that it would “vigorously” defend itself. An attorney for some of the California plaintiffs declined to comment, while a NASDAQ representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investors sued Facebook after its May 18 initial public offering, which was marred by technical glitches at the NASDAQ exchange and accusations that the company selectively disclosed unflattering information about its business prospects to privileged investors. The lawsuits, which are seeking unspecified damages, could cost Facebook millions of dollars to defend as it strives to put the IPO behind it. Facebook’s stock tumbled as much as 50 percent after its debut at $38 per share. It closed at $21.95 on Thursday. In at least 33 lawsuits seeking class action status, investors have asked courts to hold the company and its underwriters responsible for causing their losses. Facebook has said that it did not violate any rules and that NASDAQ was to blame for trading glitches on the day of the offering. Grouping cases together keeps similar lawsuits from proceeding at the same time in different courts. The case is In Re: Facebook Inc, IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, No. 12-md-2389."

2015-07-28,-11,"The Hamburg data protection authority, which is responsible for policing Facebook in Germany, said the social network firm could not unilaterally change users’ chosen usernames to their real names, nor could it ask them for official ID. The German order comes after the Belgian privacy watchdog took Facebook to court in June over the way it tracks the activities of its users. The two authorities are working with their Spanish, Dutch and French counterparts to investigate Facebook’s new privacy policy. A woman had complained to the Hamburg watchdog after Facebook blocked her account for using a pseudonym, requested a copy of her ID and unilaterally changed her username into her real name. The Hamburg Data Protection Authority said the woman did not want to use her real name to avoid being contacted through it for business matters. Forcing users to stick to their real names violated their privacy rights, it said. Facebook said it was disappointed with the order and that German courts had reviewed it on many occasions and deemed it compliant with EU law. “The use of authentic names on Facebook protects people’s privacy and safety by ensuring people know who they’re sharing and connecting with,” said a spokesperson for the company. Facebook has maintained that as its European headquarters are in Ireland it should only abide by Irish law in Europe and consequently has rejected the jurisdiction of other national authorities. In an audit in December 2011 the Irish privacy watchdog concluded that Facebook’s authentic name policy did not contravene Irish law and its reasons for the policy, such as child safety and the prevention of online harassment, were justified. However Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection, rejected the argument that Facebook should only be subject to Irish data protection laws. “For that matter Facebook cannot again argue that only Irish Data Protection law would be applicable ... anyone who stands on our pitch also has to play our game,” he said.

The world’s No. 1 social network, with more than one billion users, Facebook is gradually offering more retail services, though it relies on advertising for the bulk of its revenue. Last year, it launched a feature that allows users to send retail goods, such as sunglasses and pastries, to their friends on the social network. Facebook Finance Chief David Ebersman tempered expectations about the new gifts business in its quarterly earnings conference call with analysts on Wednesday. While Facebook believes online commerce has “long-term potential,” the current revenue from such efforts is very small and will remain so throughout the year, said Ebersman.

In its lawsuit, Yahoo said Facebook was considered “one of the worst performing sites for advertising” prior to adapting Yahoo’s ideas. Facebook then filed a countersuit of its own and called Yahoo short-sighted for its decision to prioritize “litigation over innovation.” Yahoo brought its lawsuit while the company was under the leadership of then-Chief Executive Scott Thompson. However, shortly after the case began Thompson was ousted from the company amid questions about his resume. In a court filing on Tuesday, Yahoo attorney Kevin Smith asked a San Francisco federal judge to push back a series of deadlines in the case for two weeks. Facebook did not oppose the request, Smith wrote. The extension would “facilitate settlement,” he wrote. Representatives for Yahoo and Facebook declined to comment. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Yahoo Inc. v. Facebook Inc., 12-cv-1212."
2012-03-02,-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 2 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc  will add banks in coming weeks to help underwrite its initial public offering, two sources familiar with its plans said on Friday. Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Citigroup are among the banks that will likely be added, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Last September, Facebook increased its credit line to $2.5 billion. One of the sources said that the credit line may be increased to about $5 billion in the future. In February 2011, Facebook set up a $1.5 billion credit agreement with affiliates of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Capital, the leading underwriters of the company’s IPO. Facebook plans to increase its credit line to help cover a tax bill related to employee stock awards that will vest soon after it goes public. On February 1, Facebook filed regulatory documents for an IPO. Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that Facebook would add banks to its roster of IPO underwriters. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives for Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Credit Suisse also declined to comment."
2015-07-28,-11,"The German order comes after the Belgian privacy watchdog took Facebook to court in June over the way it tracks the activities of its users. The two authorities are working with their Spanish, Dutch and French counterparts to investigate Facebook’s new privacy policy. A woman had complained to the Hamburg watchdog after Facebook blocked her account for using a pseudonym, requested a copy of her ID and unilaterally changed her username into her real name. The Hamburg Data Protection Authority said the woman did not want to use her real name to avoid being contacted through it for business matters. Forcing users to stick to their real names violated their privacy rights, it said. Facebook said it was disappointed with the order and that German courts had reviewed it on many occasions and deemed it compliant with EU law. “The use of authentic names on Facebook protects people’s privacy and safety by ensuring people know who they’re sharing and connecting with,” said a spokesperson for the company. Facebook has maintained that as its European headquarters are in Ireland it should only abide by Irish law in Europe and consequently has rejected the jurisdiction of other national authorities. In an audit in December 2011 the Irish privacy watchdog concluded that Facebook’s authentic name policy did not contravene Irish law and its reasons for the policy, such as child safety and the prevention of online harassment, were justified. However Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection, rejected the argument that Facebook should only be subject to Irish data protection laws. “For that matter Facebook cannot again argue that only Irish Data Protection law would be applicable ... anyone who stands on our pitch also has to play our game,” he said.

2013-10-02,1,"Since the start of the year, more than 145 million third-party apps have been installed by Facebook users, said Deb Liu, Facebook’s director of platform monetization, providing the company’s first public data about that portion of its business. Roughly 8,400 advertisers used Facebook’s mobile app ads in the second quarter, Liu said. That is a small group relative to the more than 1 million total advertisers that Facebook counts, but analysts say that app developers represent an attractive and growing group of customers for Facebook to tap into. Smartphone apps, designed for Apple Inc’s iPhone or Google Inc’s Android-based phones, have struggled to stand out in a crowded field. Facebook’s new mobile app ads will allow the maker of a travel app to offer to promote an airfare or hotel room, for example, while a music app like Spotify could promote a band’s new song. Previously, Facebook’s mobile app ads were designed only to entice its users to install a third-party app on their smartphone or tablet, but not to encourage repeat visits to the app. Shares of Facebook have doubled since July, as the company has increased its mobile advertising revenue. use "

2015-01-20,1,"Facebook said it will not remove fake news stories from its website. Instead, the company’s algorithm, which determines how widely user posts are distributed, will take into account hoax reports.  “A post with a link to an article that many people have reported as a hoax or chose to delete will get reduced distribution in the News Feed,” Facebook explained. Facebook has become an increasingly important source of news, with 30 percent of adults in the U.S. consuming news on the world’s largest social network, according to a 2013 study by the Pew Research Center in collaboration with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Facebook cited stories about dinosaur sightings and research supposedly proving the existence of Santa Claus as examples of fake news stories.  Facebook said “satirical” content, such as news stories “intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire,” should not be affected.  "
2012-03-13,0,"Some businesses say new advertising offerings that take advantage of Facebook’s latest Web page capabilities are helping them reach a broader audience on the 845-million-member social network. “If there’s a specific message we want to drive, we know this guarantees we’ll get in front of them,” said Steve Baer, director of strategy at Code and Theory, a New York digital marketing agency that recently ran a paid promotion for Dr. Pepper using Facebook’s new ads. Facebook’s moves to cozy up to big consumer brands is key to its efforts to boost revenue as the company prepares for an initial public offering that could value the 8-year-old company at up to $100 billion. One of Facebook’s most important challenges is convincing businesses to spend money advertising on its service rather than simply using the social network as a free promotional tool, analysts and industry observers say. Facebook is aiming its new advertising services at well-known brands like Dr. Pepper, which has amassed more than 11 million “fans” of its Facebook page, but which hasn’t done a lot of advertising on the social network, according to Baer. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group paid to try a new type of Facebook ad that ensures that a post on its brand page will be promoted to its fans in multiple places on the social network. The result, said Baer, was that the post reached 83 percent of Dr. Pepper’s Facebook fans over a 28-day period. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was allowed to use the new Facebook ad format before it was officially introduced to other advertisers two weeks ago and the level of user “engagement,” such as users “liking” the post, was 80 percent higher than normal. Investors, competitors and marketers are watching closely to see if Dr. Pepper’s initial experience and enthusiasm for the new ads is matched by the millions of other big brands that have Facebook pages. Facebook generated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011, with 85 percent of the revenue coming from its advertising business. In courting consumer brands and other businesses, Facebook is competing against the larger and more graphically rich “display” ad formats offered by websites such as Yahoo Inc, as well as against the popular Web search ads where Google Inc is the dominant player. Facebook’s revamped brand pages, which are available to businesses at no cost, offer companies more capabilities to create splashy, media-rich pages within Facebook. A chronological timeline on the right side of the page lets businesses create customized pages to showcase past milestones, and a new “offers” capability lets companies place coupons and promotions directly on their page. Companies can offer the coupons on their Facebook page for free, as well as pay for the coupon to be seen by a larger audience on Facebook. Einstein Bros Bagels, a restaurant chain owned by the Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, recently used a combination of Facebook’s paid and free services to distribute a buy-one-get-one-free sandwich coupon and was impressed with the results. “Taking someone who is online and getting them into a restaurant is a real challenge. This does it and at a better rate than other things we’ve done on Facebook did,” said Brian Lambert, director of interactive marketing and loyalty at Einstein Bros. He said that 10 percent of the 32,000 Facebook users who claimed the coupon redeemed it at a restaurant. And unlike coupons distributed in print ads, the Facebook coupons let Einstein Bros know exactly who claimed the coupons online and who redeemed them at a store. But in a sign of the continuing challenges that Facebook is up against as it tries to attract more marketing dollars, Lambert acknowledged that spending on Facebook ads is a “small portion” of the company’s total online ad spending. The bulk of Einstein Bros online ad budget currently goes to Web search ads from Google. “Our strategy for (Facebook) is still evolving,” he said. "
