# Stock-Sentiment
Final Project for BZAN 583 Text Mining
This is a collection of my files used for my final project in BZAN 583 Text Mining class. The project was an attempt to replicate 
the idea presented in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1607/1607.01958.pdf. Financial data was obtained using the 
Quandl API and the code can be seen in the file: stock_market_data.R. The news stories were downloaded from Reuters using Rvest and 
RSelenium and the code is also included in the stock_market_data.R file. Most of the .csv files are just saved copies of the financial
and news data. The .csv file 'financial_sentiment.csv' is the sentiment dictionary used for the sentiment scoring of the news articles.
